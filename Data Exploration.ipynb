But that was more than 30 years ago.\\n\\nWhen it came time to start college planning for his daughter, Anya, 17, there was never any question about setting aside money to prepare her for the standardized test that most colleges use in evaluating applicants.\\n\\nHe suggested a tutor through Kaplan Test Prep, said Anya, who lives in Harlem and is an A student at Marymount School on the Upper East Side.\\n\\nAnya\\'s two-year bill for SAT tutoring and other college test prep and coaching came to $4,500. The payoff for the high school senior who plans to apply to Ivy League schools this fall: A stellar score of 2,320 out of the new maximum of 2,400. That bettered her PSAT score by 100 points.\\n\\n\"This was a great investment,\" said Alex Havriliak, 49, who\\'s chief financial officer of Volunteers of America in Manhattan.\\n\\nWith competition fierce and with more students than ever taking the SAT — 1.5 million kids took it in the last school year, a nearly 30% jump from 10 years ago, according to the College Board — paying for study help has increasingly become a must.\\n\\nFor parents of high school juniors who want their kids to take the exams next spring, now\\'s the time to start planning.\\n\\nBut in the midst of assessing the heavy costs of college, many parents often forget the expense of test prep.\\n\\n\"Families need to budget early for this,\" said Katherine Cohen, CEO of applywise.com, a Manhattan-based online college admissions counselor.\\n\\nThere are a number of prep options at a wide range of price points. Study aids run the gamut from $399 online classes to qualified, one-on-one tutors who charge anywhere from $150 to $750 an hour.\\n\\nThe most popular form of test prep are classroom courses, although the fastest growing option is one-on-one tutoring. Classes generally cost about $1,000 and include around 30 hours of teaching as well as practice exams that simulate the real test experience. Students also supplement course work with products like $4.99 SAT prep iPod downloads and $20 shower curtains featuring the top 500 SAT words. Last year, Kaplan began selling $9.99 comic books where the characters use the most frequently tested words.\\n\\nDespite the huge growth in prep, the College Board — which owns the three-hour-and-45-minute, three-part exam that tests math, reading and writing — insists the exam gauges what you learned in high school, not fancy tricks taught by experts.\\n\\n\"The best preparation is studying hard in school,\" said Laurence Bunin, senior vice president of the SAT program for the College Board. \"Short-term expensive prep courses do not result in score gains,\" he said.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Charlie Mahoney for The New York Times\\n\\nThe annual Thanksgiving celebration in Plymouth, Mass., is held the weekend before the holiday, so as not to interfere.\\n\\nPLYMOUTH, Mass. — Here in the birthplace of Thanksgiving, where the Pilgrims first gave thanks in 1621 for their harvest and their survival, some residents are giving thanks this year for something else: the Colonial-era blue laws that prevent retailers from opening their doors on the fourth Thursday of November.\\n\\nWhile shoppers in the rest of the country will skip out on Thanksgiving to go to Walmart or Kmart or other big-box stores, William Wrestling Brewster, whose ancestors arrived on the Mayflower and participated in that first Thanksgiving, will limit his activities to enjoying a traditional meal here with his extended family at his parents’ house.\\n\\n“Thanksgiving is supposed to be about giving thanks for all you have,” said Mr. Brewster, 47, who runs a computer repair business. “I cringe to think what society is doing to itself,” he said of the mercantile mania that threatens one of the least commercial holidays.\\n\\nSome of the nation’s biggest retailers — Sears, Target and Toys “R” Us among them — announced this month that they would be moving up their predawn Black Friday door-buster sales to Thanksgiving Day or moving up their existing Thanksgiving sales even earlier on Thursday. Walmart, which has already been open on Thanksgiving for many years, is advancing its bargain specials to 8 p.m. Thursday from 10 p.m.\\n\\nBut in Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, the stores will sit dark until the wee hours of Friday. Even Walmart will not open in Maine until just after midnight Friday or in Massachusetts or Rhode Island until 1 a.m.\\n\\nNew England’s blue laws were put down by early settlers to enforce proper behavior on Sundays. (The origin of the term is unclear. Some have said the laws were printed on blue paper, while others have said the word “blue” was meant to disparage those like the “blue noses” who imposed rigid moral codes on others.)\\n\\nOver decades, many of those laws — which banned commerce, entertainment and the sale of alcohol, among other things — were tossed aside or ignored, or exemptions were granted. In some cases, the statutes were extended to holidays and barred retailers specifically from operating on Thanksgiving or Christmas.\\n\\nMaine granted an exception to L. L. Bean, whose store in Freeport is open around the clock every day, including Christmas. When the blue laws, which had faded, were revived in the 1950s, the store in Freeport was already operating 24/7, said Carolyn Beem, a spokeswoman. She said that the store, which originally catered to hunters and fishermen who shopped at odd hours, was grandfathered in and allowed to stay open on the holidays.\\n\\nNationwide, a protest is developing against Thanksgiving Day sales. Workers at some stores have threatened to strike, saying the holiday openings were disrupting their family time. Online petitions have drawn hundreds of thousands of signatures protesting the move. The stores say that many of their workers have volunteered to work on the holiday, when they will get extra pay, and that consumers wanted to shop early. It is not yet clear what effect the protests might have.\\n\\nAt the same time, this corner of New England is serving as something of a bulwark against the forces of commercialism.\\n\\nEven the Retailers Association of Massachusetts is treading gently on the notion of Thanksgiving sales.\\n\\n“There hasn’t been any outcry from our members over the years pushing this,” said Bill Rennie, vice president of the association.\\n\\nBut, as Thanksgiving shopping becomes more common, he said, “it may be time to have a discussion about it.”\\n\\nBlue laws seem anachronistic when people can shop anytime online, he said.\\n\\nThere is also the case of simple economics. These states are already at risk of losing sales to stores in New Hampshire, which has no sales tax. Now, Mr. Rennie pointed out, they could lose even more in the holiday bargain rush when stores in New Hampshire are open and stores here are closed.\\n\\nStill, Barry Finegold, a Massachusetts state senator whose district abuts New Hampshire, said that so far, none of the retailers in his district had asked for a change in the law.\\n\\nThis article has been revised to reflect the following correction:\\n\\nAn earlier version of this article misstated William Wrestling Brewsterâ\\x80\\x99s occupation. He runs a computer repair business, not a computer store.\\n\\nAn earlier version of this article misstated William Wrestling Brewsterâ\\x80\\x99s occupation.

       "  'text': \"THE gaping inequality of America’s first Gilded Age generated strong emotions. It produced social reformers like Jane Addams, anarchist agitators like Emma Goldman, labor leaders like Eugene V. Debs and Progressive politicians like Theodore Roosevelt. By the 1920s, sweeping legislation regulating food and drugs and breaking up corrupt trusts had been passed. The road to the New Deal was paved.\\n\\nBut our current Gilded Age has been greeted with relative complacency. Despite soaring inequality, worsened by the Great Recession, and recent grumbling about the 1 percent, Americans remain fairly happy. All of the wage gains since the downturn ended in 2009 have essentially gone to the top 1 percent, yet the proportion of Americans who say they are “thriving” has actually increased. So-called happiness inequality — the proportion of Americans who are either especially miserable or especially joyful — hit a 40-year low in 2010 by some measures. Men have historically been less happy than women, but that gap has disappeared. Whites have historically been happier than nonwhites, but that gap has narrowed, too.\\n\\nIn fact, American happiness has not only stayed steady, but converged, since wages began stagnating in the mid-1970s. This is puzzling. It does not conform with economic theories that compare happiness to envy, and emphasize the impact of relative income for happiness — how we compare with the Joneses.\\n\\nIn the late 1800s, Thorstein Veblen, the theorist of “conspicuous consumption,” proposed that jewels and mansions were little more than the human equivalent of the peacock’s tail — their main purpose was simply to outdo other peacock tails.\\n\\nIn 1974, the economist Richard A. Easterlin famously wrote that although richer people were happier than poorer people in the same country, people in wealthier countries were not necessarily happier than those in poorer ones (once basic needs are met). More recently, the economist Robert H. Frank has described a status drive that traps Americans in an irrational consumer arms race, in which we vie for status through ever more wasteful purchases.\\n\\nBut if happiness depends on status, and if status depends on relative income, wouldn’t today’s historic income inequality predict a giant happiness gap? Why hasn’t this happened?\\n\\nThere’s no denying that socioeconomic status is still a strong predictor of social status. And class lines have become hardened. But in its cultural expression — and therefore in its effects on our happiness — inequality is increasingly disorganized. Consumerism has expanded the lifestyles, niches and brands that supply the statuses we seek.\\n\\nAs a result, social status, which was once hierarchical and zero-sum, has become more fragmented, pluralistic and subjective. The relationship between relative income and relative status, which used to be straightforward, has gotten much more complex.\\n\\nFor most of human history, inequality of wealth meant inequality of happiness. Status, and its related activities, envy and emulation, drove consumption. By the 1950s, rapidly rising standards of living across the West, combined with social pressures to conform, all conspired to intensify status competition. The architects of “rebel cool,” like Jack Kerouac and Norman Mailer, responded by rebelling against emulation consumption and the status hierarchy of postwar America. They inverted the dominant social hierarchy, rejecting the values of those at the top and appropriating the values of those who had been marginalized at the bottom.\\n\\nThe pursuit of “the cool,” in our view, fundamentally altered the psychological motivations underlying our consumer choices. In conspicuous consumption, our emulation of higher-ups means we compete directly for status because we want what they have. But rebellious consumption changed the game, by making a product’s worth depend on how it embodied values that rejected a dominant group’s status.\\n\\nTake the Schott Perfecto leather motorcycle jacket. Worn by James Dean, and by Marlon Brando’s character in the 1953 film “The Wild One,” it symbolized a rejection of traditional respectability. In our time, the business suit remains the standard uniform in corridors of power in Wall Street and Washington. But in the San Francisco Bay Area, it might suggest a back-office support professional (accountant, lawyer, etc.) who serves at the whim of a T-shirt-and-hoodie-wearing tech entrepreneur and his similarly clad software developers.\\n\\nThere’s no longer any one way to keep up with the Joneses. If the Joneses drive a BMW 3 Series, you can compete by buying a BMW 4 Series. But if the Joneses drive a minivan, you can drive a sport utility vehicle to rebel against their staid domesticity. (This is what happened in the 1990s, when suburbanites embraced the S.U.V. as a symbol of fun and adventure.) And if the Joneses drive an S.U.V., you can drive a Prius, or forgo a car altogether — as a sign that you embrace a green lifestyle.\\n\\nBy comparing a PC user to an Orwellian drone while likening a Mac user to a sexy athlete in its iconic “1984” ad, Apple made a fundamental claim about the allure of its products. Today, Apple products are expensive because they’re seen as cool; they’re not cool because they’re expensive (which is still the case for many luxury goods).\\n\\nA new neuroscience of consumer behavior reinforces our argument. In one experiment, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to understand our brains’ reaction to perceived coolness. We selected students from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Calif., and asked them to rate, from uncool to cool, hundreds of images from the following categories: bottled water, shoes, perfumes, handbags, watches, cars, chairs, personal electronics and sunglasses. We also included images of celebrities (actors and musicians). The cooler objects typically weren’t the more expensive ones: our subjects rated a Kia hatchback above a Buick sedan, for example.\\n\\nWe then asked other students to look at images of these objects and people on a screen above their eyes, while in an fMRI scanner. The most striking finding: Asking people merely to look at products and people they considered “cool” sparked a pattern of brain activation in the medial prefrontal cortex — a part of the brain that is involved in daydreaming, planning and ruminating — similar to what happens when people receive praise. Our brain’s medial prefrontal cortex, in short, tracks our social esteem.\\n\\nA new generation of ethnographers has discovered an explosion of consumer lifestyles and product diversification in recent decades. From evangelical Christian Harley-Davidson owners, who huddle together around a motorcycle’s radio listening to a service on Sunday mornings, to lifestyles organized around musical tastes, from the solidarity of punk rockers to yoga gatherings, from meditation retreats to book clubs, we use products to create and experience community. These communities often represent a consumer micro-culture, a “brand community,” or tribe, with its own values and norms about status.\\n\\nAmong the millennials (generally defined as those born between 1981 and 1997) the diversity of status-seeking has been especially pronounced. Studies have found that teenagers and young people in their 20s commonly use musical taste as an indicator of their identity and values. No doubt, these tastes are also shaped by ethnicity and class. Nonetheless the variety of possible identities is striking. While the top 1 percent of songs each year account for something like 75 percent of all artist revenues, there are 43 million songs are for sale currently in the iTunes store.\\n\\nThis trade-off comes at a political price, as it makes income inequality less emotionally salient. In a 2013 poll asking Americans to name the most important problems facing the country, only 5 percent cited income inequality or concerns about the poor or middle class (though a recent Gallup poll did find that 67 percent of Americans were dissatisfied with the current income distribution). Politicians from Senator Elizabeth Warren on the left to Representative Paul D. Ryan on the right are talking about inequality, but President Obama has lately been talking more about “opportunity.”\\n\\nThe neuroscience of consumerism doesn’t exonerate our political and economic systems for the chasm of inequality that defines contemporary America. When a group feels unfairly deprived of material wealth, respect, rights or freedoms relative to other groups, that relative deprivation mobilizes political action. The proliferation of consumer choice helps explain why today’s Gilded Age hasn’t sparked as much outrage as the last one. Money may not buy happiness in the long run, but consumer choice has gone a long way in keeping most Americans reasonably content, even if they shouldn’t be.\\n\\nSteven Quartz, a professor of philosophy and neuroscience at the California Institute of Technology, and Anette Asp, a political scientist, are the authors of “Cool: How the Brain’s Hidden Quest for Cool Drives Our Economy and Shapes Our World.”\\n\\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter.\\n\\nA version of this op-ed appears in print on April 12, 2015, on page SR4 of the New York edition with the headline: Unequal, Yet Happy.

       "  'text': '“The Right to Fashion in the Age of Terrorism” by Minh-Ha T. Pham in Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society.\\n\\nThe Argument : Consumerism has long been considered a cornerstone of democracy and a civic obligation in American society. Ms. Pham examines why the fashion industry, in particular, became the emblem of freedom and economic revitalization following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. “Freedom to shop is one of the fundamental liberties terrorists want to deprive us of,” Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani declared in October 2001 at the start of Fashion Week in New York. Ms. Pham, an assistant professor of art history and Asian-American studies at Cornell University, argues that the ability to express oneself through dress could be starkly represented as a symbol of democracy in comparison with the burqa, which was denounced as an example of Taliban repression and invoked when government officials listed the humanitarian justifications for the war in Afghanistan. Ms. Pham complains that this assumption about the burqa, however, ignores the desires of Muslim women who may choose to be covered and discounts the hostility that the Muslim veil has sometimes incited in Western societies.\\n\\nWhat’s changed: After 9/11, going out to shop was equated with freedom of movement, and dressing yourself in style was equated with freedom of self-expression. “Cheap chic” was championed as the democratization of fashion, an example of how the political system embraces rich and poor alike. The Council of Fashion Designers of America’s Fashion for America campaign, which sold a white crew-neck T-shirt for $22.50 after 9/11 “featured a torn heart-shaped flag being sewn back together with a needle and thread, a visual metaphor for the fashion industry’s role in stitching back the heart of the nation.” Ms. Pham says that since the recession hit in 2008, the political meaning of fashion has shifted from fighting terrorism to rescuing the economy, and thereby strengthening democracy. “If people don’t shop, people lose their jobs,” she quotes the designer Vera Wang as saying in 2009. In order to halt the cycle of spiraling discounts, the fashion industry at the moment, needs consumers to pay more for clothes, not less. “Whereas just a few years ago fashion in general and cheap chic specifically were celebrated tools for the distribution of democratic rights to self-expression and self-determination, the mass distribution and consumption of fashion today are not understood as contributing to the care of the self or the nation. To the contrary, mass fashion is unhealthy for both.”\\n\\nWhat’s your take? If you splurge on that designer jacket, are you an anti-terrorism advocate, a recession buster or a spendthrift?

       "  'text': \"One of Zady's featured brands, the Imogene + Willie studio in Nashville, Tennessee.\\n\\nFriends since high school, 31 year-old Maxine Bédat and 29 year-old Soraya Darabi had always admired one another’s determined, entrepreneurial spirit. In the years after graduation, Darabi became a rising star in the digital realm, first managing social media at the New York Times and then founding the app Foodspotting, while Bédat formed the nonprofit fair trade organization The Bootstrap Project to assist artisans in the developing world. They reconnected and went on to create the website Zady, a destination for consumers who want to purchase ethically sourced and manufactured products without sacrificing style. The site, launched this week, tells a story about each brand while awarding badges of authenticity that speak to the clarity they believe consumers are seeking: locally sourced, handmade, high quality raw materials, environmentally conscious, made in the USA, and a product of The Bootstrap Project. Bédat and Darabi chatted with TIME about what it means to be a “clothitarian” and why they hope to become the Whole Foods of the fashion world.\\n\\nHow did your experience with The Bootstrap Project propel the creation of Zady? Bédat: The idea with The Bootstrap Project was to revive the craft traditions and bring employment at the same time.\\n\\nDarabi: For a long time I admired the work of nonprofit organizations like Kiva for lending microeconomic loans to artisans, often women, in the developing world, but Maxine seemed to pick up where microeconomic loans leave off by helping the artisans build up their basic business vernacular and skills and access better raw materials. Her organization trains one master artisan to teach other local artisans how to make the craft, so that ultimately something that deserves to be preserved isn’t lost entirely because of globalization. We discovered thereafter that we both had this fascination with supply chain and the way things are made.\\n\\nBédat: We weren’t born or innately interested in that. We had always shopped how the rest of our generation shopped—fast fashion and things like that. But once we dug into this story and understood that it takes, say, Rose in Zambia thirty hours to hand stitch this piece and what the symbols of it mean to her, we turned to other facets of our life and said, what about the T-shirt or the pants we’re wearing? We care so much about it in our food but in our clothing we just didn’t know. So that’s the seed of that interest.\\n\\n(MORE: Byco: Crowdfunding Fashion’s Next Big Designers)\\n\\nHow are you working to make the manufacturing process more transparent? Darabi: We were introduced to the major trade shows in the U.S. where brands from all around the world come to exhibit the products they make. What we’ve learned from doing this is that 99.99% of the brands that come to these massive expos are made overseas.\\n\\nBédat: You go to these massive halls and it’s just an endless supply of clothing. It becomes very real—in six months’ time these will be sold and in a year’s time these will be thrown out. We asked each brand, where are your products manufactured? A lot of them gave us just a blank stare. Some of them would guiltily say offshore. And there’s some people whose response was “the Orient.” So that was an indication to us of the state of the industry. People don’t know; they can’t narrow down by the continent. What we’re trying to do is for each product that we carry, we have a map associated with it. You can click on the map and it shows where the company is headquartered, where the raw materials are sourced from, and where it’s manufactured. We have each brand sign a certificate that attests to those three points. It seems like it’s basic, but in the world of apparel, it’s revolutionary.\\n\\nDarabi: Then we begin a process where we ask [brands] to go really in-depth about why they chose certain materials and why they chose their factories. We give each brand certain badges of authenticity, and then we write up a piece describing the brand and the products. So if we’re talking about Imogene + Willie jeans from Nashville, Tenn., we tell a story of Carrie and Matt, the husband and wife that started this company. They met in the third grade at a pool party and reunited about 20 years later, married, and started a denim company together. They believe in using the best raw material in the world, including the best cotton from Texas. They believe in using the best denim that’s sewn together in Greensboro, N.C. at one of the four remaining denim manufacturing mills in the country. And they believe in putting a lot of heart and soul into every pair of denim that they sell.\\n\\nBédat: That’s speaking to our general idea that the more you know about the things that you buy and the more that you get an appreciation for it, you’ll want to invest in those pieces, and have fewer but higher quality pieces in your wardrobe. Soraya and I made this commitment a year ago to become “clothitarians.” We have no better word for it at the moment, but it’s to only buy clothing where you know the origin. Since I’ve done that, the clothing that I’ve bought has maybe been a little more expensive, but I’ve actually found that I spend less on clothing. The things that I buy I really love and wear all the time.\\n\\n(MORE: Jag Offers New Perspective on Catwalk Size Wars)\\n\\nWhen you heard about the recent factory tragedies in Bangladesh, did that reinforce your mission? Bédat: When you’re buying a T-shirt that costs $2, you just have to wonder what conditions created this $2 T-shirt. It’s such a tragic event, and if regular folk like ourselves don’t change our behavior, we’re going to see more of that. There are great people out there fighting the fight, and what we’re trying to do is just provide an alternative.\\n\\nHow widespread do you think this conscious consumerism could become? Darabi: Sensationally large. The organic food movement took the world by storm, and it really began with a small subset of people who wanted to feel healthy and feel good. In addition, there was a smart businessman from Texas who recognized that there’s an aspirational lifestyle associated with people understanding where their food comes from. That struck a nerve, and I think a lot of people became devoted, loyal customers of Whole Foods because they did offer that information and that story behind product. We think that same movement could spark a zeitgeist that we’d like to be a part of, whether you call it ethical fashion, sustainable fashion or just conscious consumerism. It’s only a matter of time before people decide this is a healthier and more fun way to live.\\n\\nWhat would you say to someone who feels that they can’t afford to shop anywhere except for fast fashion chains? Bédat: It feels good to wear clothes that are good. I’ve worn this shirt probably 200 times. And I put it in the wash every time that I wear it, and it’s lasted. There are so many people, us included, who turn to their closets and they are overfilled with stuff, and yet you have nothing to wear. It’s both the right thing to do economically on a global perspective, but economically for yourself as well, if something’s going to last longer and you’re going to feel excited about wearing it for longer too.\\n\\nDarabi: For us luxury means something a little bit different. It’s not luxurious because it has a famous name or a really expensive price tag. It’s luxurious simply because of the craftsmanship and construction.\\n\\nMORE: 5 Questions with Retailer Jeffrey Kalinsky\",\n",

       "  'text': 'By Paul Wiseman and Calum MacLeod, USA TODAY\\n\\nBEIJING \\x97 Wang Zhibo runs a successful business, has plenty of money in the bank and would love to buy a house and trade in his humble second-hand car for a $14,600 Volkswagen Santana 3000.\\n\\nJust what the crumbling world economy needs — a guy with money to spare and an appetite for houses and cars.\\n\\nBut Wang, 33, won\\'t be coming to the rescue, at least not anytime soon.\\n\\nThe Beijing entrepreneur is hoarding cash until he sees how the Chinese economy weathers the storm. \"This year, I wanted to buy a house and a better car, but I won\\'t do it soon because of the economic crisis,\" he says. \"I still must save rather than spend.\"\\n\\nWang\\'s cautious attitude is typical — and a key reason China\\'s 1.3 billion consumers are unlikely to dip into their vast savings and go on a shopping spree that would recharge sputtering factories in their own country and around the world.\\n\\nShanghai-based research firm Data Driven Marketing Asia (DDMA) last month surveyed 602 consumers in five Chinese cities. The findings, released last week, were sobering for anyone holding out hope for a Chinese consumption boom: 45% were reducing their spending because of their concerns about the economy; 12% said they\\'d already lost their jobs.\\n\\nNo one can spend like Americans\\n\\nThe idea that Chinese can pick up the slack now that American shopaholics have gone on the wagon is \"rubbish when you look at it,\" DDMA director Sam Mulligan says. \"The Chinese have never been huge consumers of imported products. ... It\\'s crazy to think they\\'re going to switch and start consuming. We\\'re living in La La Land\" if we expect them to.\\n\\n\"We can\\'t get them to replicate Americans,\" agrees Paul French, the British marketing director of research firm Access Asia. \"Americans are just so good at consumerism, like obesity and greenhouse gas emissions. Although the rest of us try, it is very hard to compete.\"\\n\\nWhile the USA binged on sport-utility vehicles and McMansions over the past decade, China cranked out exports and saved and saved and saved, accumulating a staggering $2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves.\\n\\nChina\\'s domestic savings — from households like Wang\\'s, from companies banking profits and from other sources — are equal to 48.6% of the country\\'s economic output in 2007, vs. just 13.6% in the United States. The contrast between households is even more stark: In 2006 (the most recent year with statistics available for comparison), Chinese household savings amounted to 24.7% of their disposable income, compared with the USA\\'s squint-to-see-it 0.7%.\\n\\nChina served as the USA\\'s economic enabler, buying hundreds of billions of dollars worth of U.S. debt, driving down U.S. interest rates and helping inflate the U.S. housing bubble that went pop more than two years ago. Economists have been arguing ever since whether the current crisis was caused by what Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has called \"a global savings glut\" in China, other East Asian countries and oil-producing nations of the Middle East, pushing money into the USA; or by U.S. profligacy and the Fed\\'s own easy-money policies.\\n\\nNow that U.S. shoppers are on strike and Chinese exports are collapsing — down nearly 26% last month from a year earlier — policymakers in Beijing are eager to get their own thrifty people to start spending. They have announced a $590 billion stimulus package to boost China\\'s economy. Last month, they even offered rural Chinese a 13% rebate on refrigerators, washing machines and other big-ticket items.\\n\\nWhy the Chinese have to save so much\\n\\nBut Chinese families pinch pennies for good reasons. The Chinese social safety net — pensions and health care coverage — is threadbare. So Chinese pile up savings to protect themselves from medical catastrophe, to fend off poverty in retirement and to take care of parents. \"Until the social safety net is fixed,\" says Chi Lo, director of research at Ping An of China Asset Management, \"savings will remain high.\"\\n\\nAdd China\\'s 24% household savings rate to the country\\'s 7% to 15% income tax rate, notes Access Asia\\'s French, and you\\'re about up to the percentage of income that Europeans pay their governments in taxes for social services. The Chinese are \"self-taxing,\" he says. \"But it\\'s not as effective as having a welfare state. Theirs is not a bottomless pot.\" Even frugal Chinese households can be wiped out if a family member is diagnosed with a long-lasting illness such as diabetes.\\n\\nThe stimulus sets aside money for expanding health care and old-age assistance, but French notes that \"you can\\'t build a national health care service overnight.\"\\n\\nMoreover, China\\'s financial system is backward. Consumer credit, including mortgage lending, is in its infancy, so \"consumers cannot leverage their consumption,\" Chi Lo says. Although that doesn\\'t sound so bad after the U.S. mortgage meltdown, it does make it harder to rev up spending and jump-start economic growth.\\n\\nDespite their high savings rates, Chinese aren\\'t necessarily indisposed to consuming. As their economy boomed, families have steadily collected the gadgets required by modern life. For every 100 urban Chinese households in 2005 there were 96 washing machines, 137 cellphones (up from 18 in 2000), 135 color television sets and 68 DVD players, according to Chinese government statistics published in a report last year by the Cambridge, Mass.-based U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research.\\n\\n\"When people reach a certain income level,\" French says, \"they\\'re just as obsessed about upgrading their perfectly good television to a plasma screen and their perfectly good plasma screen to a Blu-ray. They\\'re just as gullible as consumers anywhere.\"\\n\\nWang Zhibo is part of China\\'s growing, but cautious, consumer class. Born in a village in eastern China\\'s Shandong Province, he migrated to Beijing seven years ago to take a $150-a-month job in a brewery. \"Life was tougher then, and salaries were low,\" he says. \"But then I made some money. We are doing better than before.\"\\n\\nThree years ago, he opened a shop selling processed meat. Now he can afford to let his wife stay home with their 2-year-old son, Guanyu, and to save up to $440 a month. He even bought a car for $5,850 — a Chinese brand Geely, modestly describing it as \"a tool to replace walking.\"\\n\\nNow he\\'d like to trade up to a better car and a bigger house. But not just yet: \"We have no insurance,\" he says during a window-shopping trip to the Beijing area\\'s first suburban shopping mall, out on the expressway to the Great Wall. \"If any of us went to the hospital we would have to pay all the bills ourselves. I must pay for my son\\'s education in the future, and my parents are old and need looking after.\"\\n\\nWiseman reported from Hong Kong\\n\\nYou share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

       "  'date': '20160812085005',\n",
       "  'text': 'Amber Rose is many things: model, actress, businesswoman and the author of a book appropriately titled, How to Be a Bad Bitch. In recent years, she’s also been recognized for her campaign against slut shaming (she created a SlutWalk to provide an inclusive space free of stigmatized sexuality), her advocacy for women and her ride-or-die friendship with Blac Chyna.\\n\\nNow, Rose has yet another title to add to the list: talk show host. On Friday, Rose will debut her VHI series, The Amber Rose Show, where she’ll discuss a myriad of topics ranging from sex and dating to pop culture and entrepreneurship. Ahead of the first episode, the sex-positive feminist discussed what the world can expect from her new show, feminism and why black lives matter.\\n\\nTIME: Why did you start The Amber Rose Show?\\n\\nRose: Initially, I didn’t even think about having a talk show, but then I did my SlutWalk and I was like, man, it would be really cool to have a bigger platform to talk about these issues, being really sex positive and unapologetic. Then I did a segment on The Doctors, a whole slut-shaming segment and Dr. Phil saw it and he was like, ‘you need your own show.’ That was almost a year and a half ago and we’ve been working on it ever since. I’m just so excited to have a voice on TV. It’s going to be about sex, relationships, obviously feminism, because I am a feminist. But this show isn’t just for women, it’s for men as well. It’s just fun, there’s a lot of comedy involved as well, we’re going to do funny skits, I’ll interview celebrities.\\n\\nSpeaking of celebrities, who would be your dream guest on the show?\\n\\nI would really love for Madonna to come on the show. I just love Madonna, she would give me a really great interview, she’s so unapologetic, such a strong woman. The world has always criticized her, but I love how she has just stuck to who she is. It’s really inspiring.\\n\\nYou’re moving into a really male-dominated area, but it feels like you’re doing it on your terms.\\n\\nThat’s the thing – I’m me. I have my own personality. I’m a fan of late night, I’ve always been a fan of late night, I love Conan O’Brien, he’s by far my favorite, I love Jimmy Kimmel, I love Jimmy Fallon, but I also know who I am as a person, and I just wanted to bring my views on life, my perspective to a late night show. I’m going to ask you questions that probably the other late night hosts aren’t going to ask, so you get to see celebrities in a different light on my show.\\n\\nYou’ve spoken extensively on slut shaming and even started a SlutWalk to combat the stigma surrounding women and sexuality. How do you think you’ve changed the dialogue around sex positivity in relation to feminism?\\n\\nI took all the punches, I took all the hits and I was comfortable with that. I did that for all the women everywhere and I knew what I was getting myself into and I was happy with that and I’m still happy with it. That’s the main reason why I refer to myself as a slut and I’ll get on Instagram and say, “hoes be winning” is because it seems like every time I do something that makes me more successful and no matter how hard I work, people are like, “Oh, you got there because you’re a ho.” People judge the way I dress or they assume that I slept with all these men. So I just embrace it. I feel like so many girls go through that in the world that are not even famous and in high school, college, or just because they’re very comfortable in their sexuality that they’re just having random sex partners every day. That’s not the case sometimes and sometimes it is, but guess what? You can do whatever you want with your body. I’m a big advocate for safe sex and HIV/AIDS awareness, I advocate for the LGBT community, and it’s really just about being who you are and not being apologetic about it. Being slut shamed for being who you are is just not fair. You should live your life to the fullest and do anything and everything that you want and not care about anyone’s opinion.\\n\\nI think that’s something that people really connect and want to identify with you. You also really value your female friendships, with makeup artist Priscilla Ono and Blac Chyna.\\n\\nThat’s the thing — I love to stick up for women, I love to be the voice for the voiceless. You know, there’s all different kinds of feminists. I don’t hate men; I love men, most of my team are men, and most of my friends are men, actually. So it’s not about having more girlfriends, but it’s about embracing their beauty and other women’s sexuality and going to them and telling them that they’re beautiful and not jumping at the other woman that slept with your man. It’s his fault, it’s not her fault — it’s like we always go towards the other women like we’re supposed to keep our legs closed and not have a sex life, when these guys are just going out and doing whatever they want. Women are very capable of being sexual beings as well. If you can make a lot of female friends, that’s amazing and if you can’t, try not to slut shame or judge each other.\\n\\nThe past few years have had a lot of big projects for you — you started your own SlutWalk, wrote a book and now you have a talk show. What are you looking forward to in the future?\\n\\nI’m the type of person where I just go with the flow and I’ll just kind of dip and dab into everything that I think I may like or even if I’m not sure, I’ll just try and see if I like it. I didn’t really think I would be into apps and the whole app world, but then I loved it and knew I wanted to do it. I just want to see where life takes me.\\n\\nDo you have any advice for drafting season?\\n\\nYes – like the precursor to cuffing season. You know, you get a nice draft of candidates ready so you can narrow it down for cuffing season and have your winter boo.\\n\\nOh yeah, cuffing season! Listen, my best advice is date as many guys as possible. I mean, have at least five on rotation because you want to weigh out your options and you want to figure out who you like the most. So if you have the time to have a different guy take you out, see how he treats you, where he comes from, what’s his background, what does he do, what’s his personality, all the things about him, then you can weigh the options and eventually you’ll find the one by the time cuffing season comes around in September, October.\\n\\nSeeing the police brutality that’s been so visible in recent weeks with Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, and knowing that this is the world that your son is growing up in, what do you think we can do to ensure that we stop the violence and value the lives of people of color?\\n\\nI feel like that’s the world that we always lived in, it’s just been brought to light with social media and Facebook Live and things going viral. You know, when people say “All Lives Matter,” yes, all lives do matter. But when you have an entire race saying, “You know when you say All Lives Matter, do you mean Black Lives Matter too?” Because it doesn’t seem like it. It doesn’t seem like it at all. The way that they shot and killed these men this past week was horrifying because that could be anybody’s son. That could have been my son, my uncles. It hits so close to home and that’s why people are so angry because these were good guys. They never hurt anybody, it’s just sad.\\n\\nChyna always makes fun of me because she says I’m an overbearing mother, she’ll tell me, “Let him go run, let him go play!” and literally the second that I said, “Okay, I’ll let my son go play over there,” he broke his arm. It’s little stuff like that, you know? Just keep your babies close. Keep your babies very close to you, talk to them every day. Let them know that people are out there and they’re very ignorant and they’re not always going to understand you. I mean, if my son was a teenager right now and he got pulled over, I would sit him down and talk to him and tell him the proper way to go about it. And the f–ked up thing is that it may still not go his way. It’s sad. My heart hurts for their families. It just hits so close to home. Me and my entire household, we just talked about it all day, how sad we were and we cried, just really mourned. It’s in the air today. It’s been in the air all week.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The latest skirmish on the gender battlefield is “Women Against Feminism”: women and girls taking to social media to declare that they don’t need or want feminism, usually via photos of themselves with handwritten placards. The feminist reaction has ranged from mockery to dismay to somewhat patronizing (or should that be “matronizing”?) lectures on why these dissidents are wrong. But, while the anti-feminist rebellion has its eye-rolling moments, it raises valid questions about the state of Western feminism in the 21st century — questions that must be addressed if we are to continue making progress toward real gender equality.\\n\\nFemale anti-feminism is nothing new. In the 19th century, plenty of women were hostile to the women’s movement and to women who pursued nontraditional paths. In the 1970s, Marabel Morgan’s regressive manifesto The Total Woman was a top best seller, and Phyllis Schlafly led opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment. But such anti-feminism was invariably about defending women’s traditional roles. Some of today’s “women against feminism” fit that mold: they feel that feminism demeans stay-at-home mothers, or that being a “true woman” means loving to cook and clean for your man. Many others, however, say they repudiate feminism even though — indeed, because — they support equality and female empowerment:\\n\\n“I don’t need feminism because I believe in equality, not entitlements and supremacy.”\\n\\n“I don’t need feminism because it reinforces the men as agents/women as victims dichotomy.”\\n\\n“I do not need modern feminism because it has become confused with misandry which is as bad as misogyny, and whatever I want to do or be in life, I will become through my own hard work.”\\n\\nOr, more than once: “I don’t need feminism because egalitarianism is better!”\\n\\nAgain and again, the dissenters say that feminism belittles and demonizes men, treating them as presumptive rapists while encouraging women to see themselves as victims. “I am not a victim” and “I can take responsibility for my actions” are recurring themes. Many also challenge the notion that American women in the 21st century are “oppressed,” defiantly asserting that “the patriarchy doesn’t exist” and “there is no rape culture.”\\n\\nOne common response from feminists is to say that Women Against Feminism “don’t understand what feminism is” and to invoke its dictionary definition: “the theory of the political, economic and social equality of the sexes.” The new anti-feminists have a rejoinder for that, too: they’re judging modern feminism by its actions, not by the book. And here, they have a point.\\n\\nConsider the #YesAllWomen Twitter hashtag, dubbed by one blogger “the Arab Spring of 21st century feminism.” Created in response to Elliot Rodger’s deadly shooting spree in Isla Vista, Calif. — and to reminders that “not all men” are violent misogynists — the tag was a relentless catalog of female victimization by male terrorism and abuse. Some of its most popular tweets seemed to literally dehumanize men, comparing them to sharks or M&M candies of which 10% are poisoned.\\n\\nConsider assertions that men as a group must be taught “not to rape,” or that to accord the presumption of innocence to a man accused of sexual violence against a woman or girl is to be complicit in “rape culture.” Consider that last year, when an Ohio University student made a rape complaint after getting caught on video engaging in a drunken public sex act, she was championed by campus activists and at least one prominent feminist blogger — but a grand jury declined to hand down charges after reviewing the video of the incident and evidence that both students were inebriated.\\n\\nConsider that a prominent British feminist writer, Laurie Penny, decries the notion that feminists should avoid such generalizations as “men oppress women”; in her view, all men are steeped in a woman-hating culture and “even the sweetest, gentlest man” benefits from women’s oppression. Consider, too, that an extended quote from Penny’s column was reposted by a mainstream reproductive-rights group and shared by nearly 84,000 Tumblr users in six months.\\n\\nSure, some Women Against Feminism claims are caricatures based on fringe views — for instance, that feminism mandates hairy armpits, or that feminists regard all heterosexual intercourse as rape. On the other hand, the charge that feminism stereotypes men as predators while reducing women to helpless victims certainly doesn’t apply to all feminists — but it’s a reasonably fair description of a large, influential, highly visible segment of modern feminism.\\n\\nAre Women Against Feminism ignorant and naive to insist they are not oppressed? Perhaps some are too giddy with youthful optimism. But they make a strong argument that a “patriarchy” that lets women vote, work, attend college, get divorced, run for political office and own businesses on the same terms as men isn’t quite living up to its label. They also raise valid questions about politicizing personal violence along gender lines; research shows that surprisingly high numbers of men may have been raped, sometimes by women.\\n\\nFor the most part, Women Against Feminism are quite willing to acknowledge and credit feminism’s past battles for women’s rights in the West, as well as the severe oppression women still suffer in many parts of the world. But they also say that modern Western feminism has become a divisive and sometimes hateful force, a movement that dramatically exaggerates female woes while ignoring men’s problems, stifles dissenting views, and dwells obsessively on men’s misbehavior and women’s personal wrongs. These are trends about which feminists have voiced alarm in the past — including the movement’s founding mother Betty Friedan, who tried in the 1970s to steer feminism from the path of what she called “sex/class warfare.” Friedan would have been aghast had she known that, 50 years after she began her battle, feminist energies were being spent on bashing men who commit the heinous crime of taking too much space on the subway.\\n\\nIs there still a place in modern-day America for a gender-equality movement? I think so. Work-family balance remains a real and complicated challenge. And there are gender-based cultural biases and pressures that still exist — though, in 21st century Western countries, they almost certainly affect men as much as women. A true equality movement would be concerned with the needs and interests of both sexes. It would, for instance, advocate for all victims of domestic and sexual violence regardless of gender — and for fairness to those accused of these offenses. It would support both women and men as workers and as parents.\\n\\nShould such a movement take back feminism — or, as the new egalitarians suggest, give up on the label altogether because of its inherent connotations of advocating for women only? I’m not sure what the answer is. But Women Against Feminism are asking the right questions. And they deserve to be heard, not harangued. As one of the group’s graphics says, “I have my own mind. Please stop fem-splaining it to me.”\\n\\nCathy Young is a contributing editor at Reason magazine.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina isn’t afraid to use the f-word: feminism.\\n\\nAt an event in Washington, D.C., Thursday evening, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO will argue that conservatives should embrace a term that some shy away from, according to her prepared remarks.\\n\\n“Feminism began as a rallying cry to empower women,” she will say at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. “But over the years, feminism has devolved into a left-leaning political ideology where women are pitted against men and used as a political weapon to win elections.”\\n\\nInstead, she offered her own definition: “A feminist is a woman who lives the life she chooses. … A woman may choose to have five children and home-school them. She may choose to become a CEO, or run for President.”\\n\\nRead More: Carly Fiorina’s Tireless Drive\\n\\nAs the only woman in the Republican field, Fiorina has talked about sexism on the campaign trail, criticizing a reporter who commented on her pink nail polish, pushing back on reporters who ask if she’s running for vice president and lamenting the time years ago that her male business colleagues held a meeting in a strip club.\\n\\nHer comments are hardly controversial, but they set her apart from some of her male competitors. In a 2005 book written with his wife, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum blamed “radical feminism” for”undermining the traditional family,” while former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee mocked activists who argue women should be allowed to be topless in public.\\n\\nIn the speech, Fiorina will also call for making birth control available without a prescription, supporting women-owned businesses and reforming safety net programs so that women can go back to work without losing benefits.\\n\\nIn a conference call with reporters Thursday afternoon, Fiorina said the speech would be the “first major” one by a Republican or Democratic candidate on the state of women in the U.S.\\n\\n“I’m pleased to be able to begin the conversation. I hope it is the beginning of a conversation, not the end of one,” she said. “And I do think that I’m in a unique position to have this conversation because of the experiences that I’ve had in my life.”\\n\\n“If we’re going to move forward with some of these programs we need to be very judicial, very careful not to overreach, so women are helped, not harmed,” she said.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The scientist of Rosetta mission fame, Matt Taylor, is arguably better known at the moment for a shirt he wore, depicting scantily clad women than his extraordinary scientific breakthrough. After a massive kerfuffle, led by feminists, Taylor broke down in tears at a briefing recently and said: “I made a big mistake and I offended many people, and I am very sorry about this.”\\n\\nMany would hail this as a feminist victory: a big-name scientist apologising on TV and being reduced to tears for his apparent sexism. We must have come a long way to wield so much influence. But there’s another way of seeing it. As less of a victory, more of a sign of a shift in feminist tactics. Instead of attacking the root cause of women’s inequality, we’ve moved towards the vilification of individuals.\\n\\nDaniel O’Reilly, a comedian who created the misogynistic Dapper Laughs, has had his TV programme axed, and there is pressure on those who do not publicly condemn him to do so. The Canadian broadcaster Jian Ghomeshi has been convicted by the kangaroo court of social media. CBC, the radio station where Ghomeshi worked, terminated his employment in October 2014 after several sexual abuse allegations were made against him, despite his denials.\\n\\nThe US “pick-up artist” Julien Blanc has been forced to leave Australia, after receiving a barrage of criticism over his “dating seminars”; these suggested that men deploy tactics of harassment and abuse to attract women. Britain and Canada are also considering a ban. He is described as “the most hated man in the world”, but rather than using racist and sexist immigration laws to keep Blanc out of the country we should be looking at using the criminal law against him. The petition to deny him a UK visa so far has more than 156,000 signatures. Would we get anything like so many signatures on a petition pressuring David Cameron to fund rape crisis centres, or to close down Yarl’s Wood – the immigration detention centre for women that has been widely criticised for its treatment of vulnerable inmates? I bet not. In fact, a petition to close Yarl’s Wood was set up earlier this year, and has attracted fewer than 50,000 signatures.\\n\\nFeminism, a great social movement, is in danger of becoming toxic and repressive. The focus on individuals, however vile they may be, signifies a shift away from the more difficult, long-term work of making institutions such as the Crown Prosecution Service and other governmental departments accountable. Justice for Women, a feminist campaigning group I co-founded, managed to change the law to prevent men claiming that “nagging” was a justifiable reason to kill female partners; Southall Black Sisters successfully challenged Ealing council when it proposed cutting women’s services. The CPS, badgered for decades by anti-FGM campaigners, ended up changing its policy and began to proactively seek prosecutions. Feminists campaigned all through the 1970s and 1980s to make rape in marriage a crime – and in 1992 the goal was achieved.\\n\\nRather than spending so much energy piling on a man for wearing a sexist shirt, is it not better to focus on the manufacturer? Is Taylor’s shirt really as problematic as an entire clothing label named Porn Star?\\n\\nThe current climate of McCarthyism within some segments of feminism and the left is so ingrained and toxic that there are active attempts to outlaw some views because they cause offence. Petitions against individuals appear to be a recent substitute for political action towards the root causes of misogyny and other social ills. Petitions have taken over politics.\\n\\nChed Evans is the only Football League player who has been convicted of rape, out of the many who have been accused, and yet feminist energy at the moment is being directed towards him as an individual rather than towards a criminal justice system that fails rape victims. It has been long known that there is endemic misogyny within football. What are we doing about the culture within the sport that makes it OK for groups of men to use their power to lure young, impressionable women back to a hotel room and queue up to “roast” her? I want the FA to initiate a “Kick Sexism out of Football” campaign.\\n\\nI have absolutely no sympathy for Evans, because he has refused to admit his guilt, and shown no remorse whatsoever. But I would far rather be waging a war against the FA for its inaction against endemic sexism in the game.\\n\\nThe “ban this sick filth” approach is starting to look more like censorship than progressive politics. Political protest and heated debate has been replaced with a witch-hunt mentality.\\n\\nIt would appear we have forgotten how to target institutions. The tactic du jour is to wind up a crowd and shut down any nuanced discussion or debate. Patriarchy is being left to its own devices while bad and unpalatable men are being taken to task one by one.\\n\\nLast year more than 20 student unions in the UK banned Robin Thicke’s song Blurred Lines, which was widely thought to glamorise rape, forbidding the playing of the song at functions within union spaces. But when University College London held events at which gender segregation was enforced, at the request of the Islamic Student Society, a National Union of Students delegate at King’s College London said that “gender segregation should be respected, if not tolerated, in institutions of higher education”.\\n\\nIdentity politics and the emergence of feminist preciousness – the tendency towards putting trigger warnings on everything and wrapping each other in cotton wool – has translated into a disproportionate focus on individuals who offend, rather than the culture that allows them to do so. That lyrics could be a more legitimate feminist target than universities that support gender apartheid is depressing.\\n\\nIt is hugely important to hold abusive men to account, but we feminist campaigners have learned that the state allows men to perpetrate individual crimes, and have therefore tended to focus on making root and branch change. Lately we appear to have gone backwards. It is as though we have lost the strength and confidence to effectively challenge institutions.\\n\\nMoral superiority and “call out” culture has trumped political activism. Feminists have a proud history of taking state institutions and corporations to task. It would seem this is being lost in a sea of vitriol. We built this movement on a desire and willingness to question and challenge old assumptions and truisms. We are in danger of becoming autocrats who would rather organise a pile-on than try to change systems. The life blood of feminism is in danger of becoming bile.\\n\\n• This article was amended on 19 November 2014. An earlier version attributed a quote made about gender separation to the then women’s officer of King’s College London Students’ Union. It was not made by her, but by a National Union of Students delegate.',\n",

       "  'date': '2016051019',\n",
       "  'text': 'This story contains spoilers for the final episode of The Good Wife\\n\\nThat’s not to say that the finale lived up to some of the show’s best episodes. The Good Wife had undeniably run its course. Last week Lucca and Jason chatted about Alicia over drinks in a sequence that felt as if it had been scripted for the lawyer’s former sidekick and love interest, Kalinda and Will, three years ago. The show was repeating old drama with less interesting characters. As bitter as I am at Josh Charles and Archie Panjabi for jumping ship, they seem to have done so at the right time.\\n\\nIndeed, the whole plot has come full circle: the show opened with the question of whether Peter would go to jail, and if Alicia would stick by him. Tonight, with Peter again facing conviction and divorce, we finally got our answer: yes and no. She’ll stand next to him for the optics, but won’t hold his hand at the podium. Whether that’s a character growing stronger or growing into a more cynical political operative, I will leave to you to decide.\\n\\nBut let us not bemoan the decline of The Good Wife — it’s a rare television show that ends with its strongest season — but celebrate what it did give us.\\n\\nThe Good Wife gave us a revolutionary take on modern feminism. One of television’s few complicated heroines, the writers also let her grow and, more importantly, contradict herself without apologizing or explaining her actions. The show made us both love and hate Alicia, while other television writers fretted over their heroines being “likable.”\\n\\nThe finale proved to be a clear embodiment of this idea of flawed feminism as Alicia decides she wants to be with Jason, whom she describes as “a boy,” just because she doesn’t want to live in her apartment alone—an utterly depressing conclusion for feminist fans of the show. It’s apt, then, that this wish isn’t fulfilled. Not only that, but when the audience thinks the resolution might be that Diane and Alicia were in fact meant to be (a girl-power conclusion), Diane, a symbol of relentless feminism on the show, slaps Alicia in the face in the final moments (paralleling Alicia’s empowering slap of Peter in the first episode).\\n\\nZack’s new fiancé (another new actor in a familiar role for the show) comes out and says it in the third-to-last episode: some might think Alicia sticking by her man is retro, but feminism means women can do whatever they want — even if that means playing the saint.\\n\\nOf course, what this character doesn’t know is that “St. Alicia,” over the course of seven seasons, has slowly learned that she doesn’t have to be, well, the good wife. Her affair with Will was tentative, fraught and full of complications. Not so for her relationship with Jason. She doesn’t care what people think and is even willing to make out with her investigator boyfriend in a bar. (A whole other piece could be written about the frank depiction of sexuality on the show: it’s rare for Hollywood to offer us a woman over 40 who is allowed to enjoy sex, let alone receive oral pleasure.)\\n\\nIn Season 1, we saw a lot more of Grace and Zack as Alicia tried to balance work and home and struggled with “bad mother” guilt. By Season 7, she’s employed Grace to help her with her career goals and accepted that Zack’s quick marriage as his mistake to make.\\n\\nShe’s shaken by Peter’s transgressions in the beginning, but by the penultimate episode she responds to Peter’s latest affair by mock crying and rolling her eyes. She’s gotten tougher, accepted her flaws, gone after her goals. She’s not the feminist hero we deserve — as we see with the slap — but she’s definitely evolved. That is a woman doing what she wants. Though Julianna Margulies has emphatically denied the comparison, the Hillary Clinton parallel is undeniable: think of the presidential candidate in the days of the Monica Lewinsky scandal compared to today.\\n\\nThe Good Wife gave us surprisingly nuanced debates around hot-button issues like abortion, gun control, gay marriage, government surveillance, campus rape and the tech bubble. (Oh, ChumHum, you will be missed.) Even as the country was becoming more politically polarized, Emily’s List darling Diane has productive conversations with her Sarah Palin–worshipping husband about the right to bear arms or with a right-wing businessman about whether a devout Christian baker can legally refuse to create a wedding cake for a gay couple. Though the main characters were Democrats, the show never assumed they were right.\\n\\nAnd The Good Wife gave us a well-made drama every Sunday night for 22 weeks a year. Besides offering one of the greatest Hollywood romances — no, I’m not talking about Peter or Jason but the ghost that joined us in the finale — it was arguably the only remaining prestige drama on network television. It was the last show from one of the major networks to be nominated for a best drama Emmy in 2011. (It never won.) Ever since, cable dramas like Mad Men, British imports like Downton Abbey and streaming-service darlings like Netflix’s House of Cards have dominated the category.\\n\\nThe Emmys are by no means the definitive judge of quality television: fans of Scandal and Grey’s Anatomy would argue that Shonda Rhimes is writing great drama on ABC. But those shows rely on “OMG moments” every single episode that The Good Wife and other “prestige television shows,” from The Sopranos to Breaking Bad, sprung on their audiences once a season. The closest The Good Wife ever came to a must-tweet scene was Will’s shocking death (and tonight’s ghostly return), a moment that worked precisely because it was so out of character for the show.\\n\\nIt’s the end of an era. Both Charles and Margulies have vowed never to act in a 22-episode-per-year drama again: they require 14-hour workdays year-round. For better or worse, these sorts of shows have been cut down to eight- or 12-episode seasons and sold to cable networks, streaming services or HBO. Network television, meanwhile, seems content with procedurals like CSI or replicating the Shondaland model with shows like Empire and Quantico. It’s similar to what’s happened in film, where most studios lean heavily on superhero blockbusters and leave the quieter fare to indie filmmakers who must seek out smaller distributors. Luckily for television fans, AMC, Netflix and the like seem willing to take risks on this sort of fare — at least for now.\\n\\nAfter the soon-to-be-infamous slap, Alicia composes herself and struts forward. May all our future television heroes and heroines exhibit such chutzpah.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Lana Del Rey: 7 Controversial Interview Quotes Aliens Feminism Sex',\n",
       "  'date': '2014072519',\n",
       "  'text': 'Lana Del Rey is never boring — the eccentric pop star can always be relied on to provide at least a few nuggets of weirdness in any given interview. She’s getting flak right now for the first item listed below, but why are we surprised? She’s always got something offbeat and amazing to say.\\n\\n1) She’s “annoyed” that her sex life never helped her get a record deal.\\n\\nEven though one of her new songs is called “F***ed My Way Up to the Top,” Del Rey told Complex magazine that sleeping with guys in the music industry has never helped her career.\\n\\nYou know, I have slept with a lot of guys in the industry. But none of them helped me get my record deals. Which is annoying.\\n\\nI relate to being the person who people come to for “such a change from the old routine,” but not being the main thing. I had a long-term relationship for seven years with someone who was the head of a label and I felt like I was that change of routine. I was always waiting to become the person who his kids came home to, and it never happened.\\n\\nIt’s important to note that most of the coverage of this controversial quote has focused on the “I have slept with a lot of guys” part, not the effect it might have had on her career. Several big media outlets put the quote in their headlines, which can come off as slut-shaming.\\n\\n2) Tesla is way cooler than feminism.\\n\\nIn a recent interview in Fader magazine, she made it clear where she stands on the age-old Feminists vs. Aliens debate:\\n\\n“For me, the issue of feminism is just not an interesting concept. I’m more interested in, you know, SpaceX and Tesla, what’s going to happen with our intergalactic possibilities. Whenever people bring up feminism, I’m like, god. I’m just not really that interested.”\\n\\nFeminist aliens have yet to weigh in.\\n\\n3) She kind of has a death wish.\\n\\nShe once told The Guardian that she admired Amy Winehouse and Kurt Cobain so much that “I wish I were dead already,” which led to a lengthly discussion of mortality:\\n\\nInterviewer: Is early death glamorous?\\n\\n“I don’t know. Ummm, yeah.”\\n\\n“I do! I don’t want to have to keep doing this. But I am.\\n\\nInterviewer: Do what? Make Music?\\n\\n“Everything. That’s just how I feel. If it wasn’t that way, then I wouldn’t say it. I would be scared if I knew [death] was coming, but …”\\n\\nThe singer retracted her comments afterward on Twitter in a series of now-deleted tweets, saying the interviewer had asked her leading questions.\\n\\n4) Her friend Juliette Lewis didn’t realize that was her on SNL.\\n\\nIn outtakes from this month’s Rolling Stone profile, Del Rey reveals that she was friends with Juliette Lewis before the actress publicly dissed her Saturday Night Live performance:\\n\\nI was actually friends with her before that but she didn’t know it was me on TV. I had been more blonde before or something. She called me and was like, ‘Oh, I’m so sorry.’ But we got over it. Because the truth is, we’re birds of a feather in a way. In the end, we thought it was really funny.\\n\\nBecause messing up your friend’s hair color can happen to anybody!\\n\\n5) Every day is Opposite Day.\\n\\nBecause Lana Del Rey is George Constanza:\\n\\n“I’m really specific about why I’m doing something or writing something. But it always kind of gets translated in the opposite fashion. I haven’t done it yet, but I’ve learned that everything I’m going to do is going to have the opposite reaction of what I meant. So I should do the opposite if I want a good reaction.”\\n\\nWhen Rolling Stone pointed out that George already tried this, she says, “Oh really? That’s awesome. Me and George Costanza!”\\n\\n6) She mixes up sounds and colors.\\n\\nIt sounds like the directions she gave to Ultraviolence producer Dan Auerbach were, um, confusing (also from the Rolling Stone outtakes:)\\n\\n“I would explain things to him in terms of colors and touchstone words,” she says. “My word for the record was ‘fire,’ you know, blue fire, when a flame gets so hot it goes from red to blue. And I told him I wanted everything to sound like it was in the key of blue. And I think at first he was like, ‘What the f*ck?’”\\n\\nThis was mostly to distinguish from Lady Gaga, who wants everything to sound like it’s in the key of rainbows.',\n",

       "  'date': '2014123119',\n",
       "  'text': '2014 was an immense year for feminism.\\n\\nIt appeared onstage with Beyoncé, who helpfully let Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie define it for us in her song “Flawless.” Taylor Swift said she wasn’t one, then realized she was. (Taylor Swift also said many other remarkable things, such as “Have you heard of the Loneliest Whale?… It swims through the ocean, and it has a call unlike any other whale’s. So it doesn’t have anyone to swim with. And everybody feels so sorry for this whale – but what if this whale is having a great time?” but right now we are talking about feminism.) “Bad Feminist” by Roxane Gay, hit the bestseller lists. We had Katniss and Princess Elsa and Lorde. Feminism was everywhere. Feminist comedy, feminist twitter, feminist activism. We took on issues like pay discrepancies, street harassment and sexual assault on campus. Suddenly, being a feminist was cool and mainstream and expected in ways it hadn’t been previously. It got so big that Time magazine offered to “ban” the word, and of course the Feminist Internet was upset about that.\\n\\nWe couldn’t possibly ban the word. The year proved we still needed it.\\n\\nThe Sony hack, among other things, let us see the gap that still exists in pay between women and men, even at high levels. Videos showed what it felt like to walk down the street every day as a woman, being aggressively and vigorously “complimented” on all sides. And the year was full of testimonies from women who hadn’t been heard before — or, if heard, hadn’t been believed. The personal became political, as Lucia Graves notes at the National Journal, in a big way. Personal stories — between the covers of books, or shared online or in the pages of newspapers and magazines — shaped the debate in a way that had not happened before. People, more than before, were willing to listen.\\n\\nThere’s still a ways left to go, but it’s exciting to see how vital and vigorous — and, increasingly, intersectional, feminism feels in 2014.\\n\\nBut sometimes I worry. That feminism is now so popular that it’s become a fad. That it’s just another box to check, for celebrities — whose understanding of the term we should not be relying on anyway — and that “Sure, I’m a feminist, but” is the new “I’m not a feminist, but.” I’m glad it’s “in,” but whether or not feminism is “in” is beside the point — you wouldn’t suddenly believe in gravity just because Demi Lovato said she did.\\n\\nWe also acquired a new, fun ritual of asking celebrities whether they were feminists, then yelling at the ones who said no, because generally these celebrities also said things like “I am not a feminist, because I like to cook for men” (spoiler alert: this does not mean you are ineligible to be a feminist). It’s almost like saying, “I am not a feminist, because I don’t think men should be captured and thrown into camps” (not sure where you’re getting this idea) or “I am not a feminist because I don’t think women are better than men” (also not what being a feminist means) or “I am not a feminist because I hate having hair under my arms and I prefer to recycle my bras, not burn them” (seriously, where is everyone getting this?) or “I am not a feminist because I am literally a fish on a bicycle” (what?) and it was fun to plow through these straw feminists and insist that they were only not feminists because they Didn’t Understand. It is still fun, but I wish this were less of a gotcha question and we would just let our celebrities come to feminism on their own terms. There are better reasons to be a feminist than that Beyoncé is a feminist, or that Shailene Woodley isn’t. Second-hand celebrity styles can be marvelous, but second-hand, gently-used celebrity opinions are always a little dangerous.\\n\\nPlain and simple, feminism is a belief in the equality of the sexes, with everything else that implies. Women don’t have to be strong female heroines toting around archery equipment, or scientists, or dystopic heroines, or even princesses. They can just be themselves, people, in all their wondrous variety.\\n\\nHere, capping off the year, is a screencap of Kaley Cuoco from Redbook Magazine, nestling with a horse, saying she is not a feminist. You tell that horse, Kaley.\\n\\nYou don’t have to be a feminist. Don’t be a feminist because it was cool in 2014. 2014 was terrible. Be a feminist because people are people. It’s simple.\\n\\nAlexandra Petri writes the ComPost blog, offering a lighter take on the news and opinions of the day.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The first book by the satirical website Reductress, “How to Win at Feminism: The Definitive Guide to Having It All — And Then Some!”(HarperOne, $22.99 paper) pulls no punches. With chestnuts including “How to Love Your Body Even Though Hers is Better” and “Empowerment Exercise: Embody a Man,” “How to Win at Feminism” unearths — and then skewers — the hidden implications and doublespeak embedded in women’s media, the rebranding of feminism to be “on brand.” The book is funny, provocative, and ultimately on-point.\\n\\nReductress’ merciless irreverence has prompted comparisons to a feminist version of “The Onion.” I spoke to founders and co-authors Beth Newell and Sarah Pappalardo over the phone about satire, mansplaining and more. They’ll be signing “How to Win At Feminism” Friday at Skylight Books in Los Angeles at 7:30 p.m. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\\n\\nSome of the funniest passages in the book come in the form of “Advertorials.” “Lumps Gym” sends up the rhetoric around women’s fitness: at Lumps Gym, “it’s not about changing your body, it’s about changing your whole self.” What was the inspiration?\\n\\nSarah Pappalardo: The inspiration for the advertorials came in part from the ads you find in women’s magazines, especially the kind where the “storytelling” aims to absolve women of their guilt for living in a developed world and with the degree of wealth and privilege. It’s everything from these kind of well-meaning companies that don’t always do very much to actually to change the world, all the way down to the “empowerment marketing” that we see used to sell lotion or tea or chocolate, these “gendered” products. The “Lumps Gym” advertorial is a good example of where we used as much doublespeak as possible. There’s this trend of, “You need to love your body no matter what, but you also need to be healthy, but you also need to love your body,” ad nauseam.\\n\\nBeth Newell: No matter how empowering certain media is it’s still telling us that we need to change something or buy something. It’s always preying on our insecurity, even when it’s in the guise of female empowerment.\\n\\nPieces often begin on the edge of plausibility then escalate to full-blown absurdity. You both come from comedy backgrounds. Can you talk about that sense of escalation in regard to structure?\\n\\nPappalardo: I don’t want to mansplain here, but there’s a term for that and it’s called heightening. Whoops! I just mansplained.\\n\\nLike Reductress, “How to Win at Feminism” feels of-the-moment not just in content, but also in tone, toggling between references to Instagram, Ruth Bader Ginsberg, selfies and bell hooks. Did you have a millennial audience in mind?\\n\\nPappalardo: I think it’s a very millennial book. We do have a few Easter eggs in there for people who may be of the, uh, older persuasion. (They’ve made a lifestyle choice to grow old, but I don’t know why.) We reference a lot of second-wave feminism, things that our mothers dealt with and that we now take for granted. That was a big inspiration for us as well.\\n\\nNewell: One of things that’s exciting for us to cover is the ways that women interact with feminist issues in their daily lives, today, in 2016. A lot of people have a tendency to think that feminist issues have been resolved, and we’re shining a light on what’s still going on out there. What the book and the site are doing is allowing us to laugh at ourselves.\\n\\nDo you consider writing satire a political act?\\n\\nNewell: Satire is a more cathartic, palatable way of getting the news you already get — it doesn’t necessarily change any minds. The only place where I could see satire really affecting change is when it comes to young people who are just entering the political conversation and trying to educate themselves about the forces at play. Otherwise I think it reinforces our perceptions of the world.\\n\\nPappalardo: We’re not necessarily going to change minds, but we do hope to highlight the things that people take for granted in terms of subtle messaging and micro-aggressions aimed towards women. Satire allows us to make a statement through both form and content, as opposed to just saying ‘Hey, this is a problem.’ But if you don’t agree with the same premises that we do when we’re constructing satire, you can read a satirical piece entirely differently than intended.\\n\\nDo you have any concerns that the title, or even the book itself, might be read that way – “differently than intended?”\\n\\nNewell: A man at a book fair told us that we were the reason that Trump was getting elected. We don’t really know what his thought process was.\\n\\nPappalardo: I know! I mean, it was a comedy book fair! Regarding the title, we wanted it clear that the title undermines the genuine goals and tenets and feminism, which is that feminism is for everyone. We wanted to go in direct contrast to that, so that you see the title and think, “Hey, wait a minute, that’s not right.”\\n\\nFrench is a writer in Los Angeles.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Congratulations! And thank you for that wonderful welcome. And thank you President Bottomly for that wonderful introduction.\\n\\nI have admired Wellesley—its mission, its story, its successes—for a long time and I thank you very much for inviting me.\\n\\nYou are ridiculously lucky to be graduating from this bastion of excellence and on these beautiful acres.\\n\\nAnd if the goddesses and gods of the universe do the right thing, then you will also very soon be the proud alumnae of the college that produced America’s first female president! Go Hillary!\\n\\nI’m truly, truly happy to be here today, so happy, in fact, that when I found out your class color was yellow, I decided I would wear yellow eye shadow. But on second thoughts, I realized that as much as I admire Wellesley, even yellow eye-shadow was a bit too much of a gesture. So I dug out this yellow—yellowish—headwrap instead.\\n\\nSpeaking of eye shadow, I wasn’t very interested in makeup until I was in my twenties, which is when I began to wear makeup. Because of a man. A loud, unpleasant man. He was one of the guests at a friend’s dinner party. I was also a guest. I was about 23, but people often told me I looked 12. The conversation at dinner was about traditional Igbo culture, about the custom that allows only men to break the kola nut, and the kola nut is a deeply symbolic part of Igbo cosmology.\\n\\nI argued that it would be better if that honor were based on achievement rather than gender, and he looked at me and said, dismissively, “You don’t know what you are talking about, you’re a small girl.”\\n\\nI wanted him to disagree with the substance of my argument, but by looking at me, young and female, it was easy for him to dismiss what I said. So I decided to try to look older.\\n\\nSo I thought lipstick might help. And eyeliner.\\n\\nAnd I am grateful to that man because I have since come to love makeup, and its wonderful possibilities for temporary transformation.\\n\\nSo, I have not told you this anecdote as a way to illustrate my discovery of gender injustice. If anything, it’s really just an ode to makeup.\\n\\nIt’s really just to say that this, your graduation, is a good time to buy some lipsticks—if makeup is your sort of thing—because a good shade of lipstick can always put you in a slightly better mood on dark days.\\n\\nIt’s not about my discovering gender injustice because of course I had discovered years before then. From childhood. From watching the world.\\n\\nI already knew that the world does not extend to women the many small courtesies that it extends to men.\\n\\nI also knew that victimhood is not a virtue. That being discriminated against does not make you somehow morally better.\\n\\nAnd I knew that men were not inherently bad or evil. They were merely privileged. And I knew that privilege blinds because it is the nature of privilege to blind.\\n\\nI knew from this personal experience, from the class privilege I had of growing up in an educated family, that it sometimes blinded me, that I was not always as alert to the nuances of people who were different from me.\\n\\nAnd you, because you now have your beautiful Wellesley degree, have become privileged, no matter what your background. That degree, and the experience of being here, is a privilege. Don’t let it blind you too often. Sometimes you will need to push it aside in order to see clearly.\\n\\nI bring greetings to you from my mother. She’s a big admirer of Wellesley, and she wishes she could be here. She called me yesterday to ask how the speech-writing was going and to tell me to remember to use a lot of lotion on my legs today so they would not look ashy.\\n\\nMy mother is 73 and she retired as the first female registrar of the University of Nigeria—which was quite a big deal at the time.\\n\\nMy mother likes to tell a story of the first university meeting she chaired. It was in a large conference room, and at the head of the table was a sign that said CHAIRMAN. My mother was about to get seated there when a clerk came over and made to remove the sign. All the past meetings had of course been chaired by men, and somebody had forgotten to replace the CHAIRMAN with a new sign that said CHAIRPERSON. The clerk apologized and told her he would find the new sign, since she was not a chairman.\\n\\nMy mother said no. Actually, she said, she WAS a chairman. She wanted the sign left exactly where it was. The meeting was about to begin. She didn’t want anybody to think that what she was doing in that meeting at that time on that day was in any way different from what a CHAIRMAN would have done.\\n\\nI always liked this story, and admired what I thought of as my mother’s fiercely feminist choice. I once told the story to a friend, a card carrying feminist, and I expected her to say bravo to my mother, but she was troubled by it.\\n\\n“Why would your mother want to be called a chairman, as though she needed the MAN part to validate her?” my friend asked.\\n\\nIn some ways, I saw my friend’s point.\\n\\nBecause if there were a Standard Handbook published annually by the Secret Society of Certified Feminists, then that handbook would certainly say that a woman should not be called, nor want to be called, a CHAIRMAN.\\n\\nBut gender is always about context and circumstance.\\n\\nIf there is a lesson in this anecdote, apart from just telling you a story about my mother to make her happy that I spoke about her at Wellesley, then it is this: Your standardized ideologies will not always fit your life. Because life is messy.\\n\\nWhen I was growing up in Nigeria I was expected, as every student who did well was expected, to become a doctor. Deep down I knew that what I really wanted to do was to write stories. But I did what I was supposed to do and I went into medical school.\\n\\nI told myself that I would tough it out and become a psychiatrist and that way I could use my patients’ stories for my fiction.\\n\\nBut after one year of medical school I fled. I realized I would be a very unhappy doctor and I really did not want to be responsible for the inadvertent death of my patients. Leaving medical school was a very unusual decision, especially in Nigeria where it is very difficult to get into medical school.\\n\\nLater, people told me that it had been very courageous of me, but I did not feel courageous at all.\\n\\nWhat I felt then was not courage but a desire to make an effort. To try. I could either stay and study something that was not right for me. Or I could try and do something different. I decided to try. I took the American exams and got a scholarship to come to the US where I could study something else that was NOT related to medicine. Now it might not have worked out. I might not have been given an American scholarship.\\n\\nMy writing might not have ended up being successful. But the point is that I tried.\\n\\nWe can not always bend the world into the shapes we want but we can try, we can make a concerted and real and true effort. And you are privileged that, because of your education here, you have already been given many of the tools that you will need to try. Always just try. Because you never know.\\n\\nAnd so as you graduate, as you deal with your excitement and your doubts today, I urge you to try and create the world you want to live in.\\n\\nMinister to the world in a way that can change it. Minister radically in a real, active, practical, get your hands dirty way.\\n\\nWellesley will open doors for you. Walk through those doors and make your strides long and firm and sure.\\n\\nWrite television shows in which female strength is not depicted as remarkable but merely normal.\\n\\nTeach your students to see that vulnerability is a HUMAN rather than a FEMALE trait.\\n\\nCommission magazine articles that teach men HOW TO KEEP A WOMAN HAPPY. Because there are already too many articles that tell women how to keep a man happy. And in media interviews make sure fathers are asked how they balance family and work. In this age of ‘parenting as guilt,’ please spread the guilt equally. Make fathers feel as bad as mothers. Make fathers share in the glory of guilt.\\n\\nCampaign and agitate for paid paternity leave everywhere in America.\\n\\nHire more women where there are few. But remember that a woman you hire doesn’t have to be exceptionally good. Like a majority of the men who get hired, she just needs to be good enough.\\n\\nRecently a feminist organization kindly nominated me for an important prize in a country that will remain unnamed. I was very pleased. I’ve been fortunate to have received a few prizes so far and I quite like them especially when they come with shiny presents. To get this prize, I was required to talk about how important a particular European feminist woman writer had been to me. Now the truth was that I had never managed to finish this feminist writer’s book. It did not speak to me. It would have been a lie to claim that she had any major influence on my thinking. The truth is that I learned so much more about feminism from watching the women traders in the market in Nsukka where I grew up, than from reading any seminal feminist text. I could have said that this woman was important to me, and I could have talked the talk, and I could have been given the prize and a shiny present.\\n\\nBecause I had begun to ask myself what it really means to wear this FEMINIST label so publicly.\\n\\nJust as I asked myself after excerpts of my feminism speech were used in a song by a talented musician whom I think some of you might know. I thought it was a very good thing that the word ‘feminist’ would be introduced to a new generation.\\n\\nBut I was startled by how many people, many of whom were academics, saw something troubling, even menacing, in this.\\n\\nIt was as though feminism was supposed to be an elite little cult, with esoteric rites of membership.\\n\\nBut it shouldn’t. Feminism should be an inclusive party. Feminism should be a party full of different feminisms.\\n\\nAnd so, class of 2015, please go out there and make Feminism a big raucous inclusive party.\\n\\nThe past three weeks have been the most emotionally difficult of my life. My father is 83 years old, a retired professor of statistics, a lovely kind man. I am an absolute Daddy’s girl. Three weeks ago, he was kidnapped near his home in Nigeria. And for a number of days, my family and I went through the kind of emotional pain that I have never known in my life. We were talking to threatening strangers on the phone, begging and negotiating for my father’s safety and we were not always sure if my father was alive. He was released after we paid a ransom. He is well, in fairly good shape and in his usual lovely way, is very keen to reassure us all that he is fine.\\n\\nI am still not sleeping well, I still wake up many times at night, in panic, worried that something else has gone wrong, I still cannot look at my father without fighting tears, without feeling this profound relief and gratitude that he is safe, but also rage that he had to undergo such an indignity to his body and to his spirit.\\n\\nAnd the experience has made me re-think many things, what truly matters, and what doesn’t. What I value, and what I don’t.\\n\\nAnd as you graduate today, I urge you to think about that a little more. Think about what really matters to you. Think about what you WANT to really matter to you.\\n\\nI read about your rather lovely tradition of referring to older students as “big sisters” and younger ones as “little sisters.” And I read about the rather strange thing about being thrown into the pond—and I didn’t really get that—but I would very much like to be your honorary big sister today.\\n\\nWhich means that I would like to give you bits of advice as your big sister:\\n\\nAll over the world, girls are raised to be make themselves likeable, to twist themselves into shapes that suit other people.\\n\\nPlease do not twist yourself into shapes to please. Don’t do it. If someone likes that version of you, that version of you that is false and holds back, then they actually just like that twisted shape, and not you. And the world is such a gloriously multifaceted, diverse place that there are people in the world who will like you, the real you, as you are.\\n\\nI am lucky that my writing has given me a platform that I choose to use to talk about things that I care about, and\\n\\nI have said a few things that have not been so popular with a number of people. I have been told to shut up about certain things – such as my position on the equal rights of gay people on the continent of Africa, such as my deeply held belief that men and women are completely equal. I don’t speak to provoke. I speak because I think our time on earth is short and each moment that we are not our truest selves, each moment we pretend to be what we are not, each moment we say what we do not mean because we imagine that is what somebody wants us to say, then we are wasting our time on earth.\\n\\nI don’t mean to sound precious but please don’t waste your time on earth, but there is one exception. The only acceptable way of wasting your time on earth is online shopping.\\n\\nOkay, one last thing about my mother. My mother and I do not agree on many things regarding gender. There are certain things my mother believes a person should do, for the simple reason that said person ‘is a woman.’ Such as nod occasionally and smile even when smiling is the last thing one wants to do. Such as strategically give in to certain arguments, especially when arguing with a non-female. Such as get married and have children. I can think of fairly good reasons for doing any of these. But ‘because you are a woman’ is not one of them. And so, Class of 2015, never ever accept ‘Because You Are A Woman’ as a reason for doing or not doing anything.\\n\\nAnd, finally I would like to end with a final note on the most important thing in the world: love.\\n\\nNow girls are often raised to see love only as giving. Women are praised for their love when that love is an act of giving. But to love is to give AND to take.\\n\\nPlease love by giving and by taking. Give and be given. If you are only giving and not taking, you’ll know. You’ll know from that small and true voice inside you that we females are so often socialized to silence.\\n\\nDon’t silence that voice. Dare to take.\\n\\nThis commencement speech originally appeared on Wellesley.edu.\\n\\nRead more 2015 commencement speeches:\\n\\nAlan Alda to Grads: Everything in Life Takes Time\\n\\nBernard Harris to Grads: You Are an Infinite Being With Infinite Possibilities\\n\\nBill Nye to Grads: Change the World\\n\\nChris Matthews to Grads: ‘Make Them Say No. Never Say No to Yourself’\\n\\nColin Powell to Grads: Learn to Lead\\n\\nDarren Walker to Grads: Build a Bridge to a Better World\\n\\nEd Helms to Grads: Define Yourselves\\n\\nEric Schmidt to Grads: You Can Write the Code for All of Us\\n\\nSnapchat CEO Evan Spiegel to Grads: ‘This Is the World We Were Born Into, and We Are Responsible for It’\\n\\nGwen Ifill to Grads: If You See Something, Do Something\\n\\nGE CEO Jeff Immelt to Grads: Become a Force for Change\\n\\nIan McEwan to Grads: Defend Free Speech\\n\\nJoe Plumeri to Grads: Go Out and Play in Traffic\\n\\nJon Bon Jovi to Grads: Lead By Example\\n\\nJorge Ramos’ Message for Journalists: Take a Stand\\n\\nJoyce Carol Oates to Grads: Be Stubborn and Optimistic\\n\\nKatie Couric to Grads: Get Yourself Noticed\\n\\nKen Burns to Grads: Set Things Right Again\\n\\nKenneth Cole to Grads: Find Your Voice\\n\\nMadeleine Albright to Grads: The World Needs You\\n\\nMark Ruffalo to Grads: Buck the System\\n\\nMatthew McConaughey to Grads: Always Play Like an Underdog\\n\\nMaya Rudolph to Grads: Create Your Own Destiny\\n\\nMellody Hobson to Grads: Set Your Sights High\\n\\nMeredith Vieira to Grads: Be the Left Shark\\n\\nMichelle Obama to Grads: Shape the Revolution\\n\\nMitt Romney to Grads: America Needs You to Serve\\n\\nNatalie Portman to Grads: Carve Your Own Path\\n\\nPresident Obama to Grads: We Should Invest in People Like You\\n\\nPresident Obama to Cadets: Lead the Way on Fighting Climate Change\\n\\nSalman Rushdie to Grads: Try to Be Larger Than Life\\n\\nSamantha Power to Grads: Start Changing the World By ‘Acting As If’\\n\\nStephen Colbert to Grads: You Are Your Own Professor Now\\n\\nTim Cook to Grads: Tune Out the Cynics',\n",

       "  'text': 'A sharp new report published today by the Barnard Center for Research on Women finds that networked activism and organizing by a new generation of feminists is having a big impact on the social commons – but that funding and long-term commitment by key institutions are needed to keep that movement growing.\\n\\nWritten by veteran feminist analysts Courtney Martin and Vanessa Valenti, #FemFuture: Online Revolution examines the impact of recent online feminist causes – from the Komen-Planned Parenthood defunding battle to organizing around reaction to reaction to the tragic death of a 23-yar-old New Delhi gang rape victim this year – while also making a series of pointed recommendations about how to build on those successes and spur a more sustainable movement. The landmark report is the first of its kind to both define this new era of networked feminism and shape a course for expanding its reach.\\n\\n“Online feminism has transformed the way advocacy and action function within the feminist movement,” writes Martin in the introduction. “And yet, this amazing innovation in movement organizing is unsustainable. Bloggers and online organizers largely suffer from a psychology of deprivation—a sense that their work will never be rewarded as it deserves to be, that they are in direct competition with one another for the scraps that come from third-party ad companies or other inadequate attempts to bring in revenue. As a result, they are vulnerable, less effective, and risk burn out. Under these conditions, online feminism isn’t being sufficiently linked to larger organizational and movement efforts and/or leveraged for the greatest impact at this critical moment.”\\n\\nThe report centers on a loosely organized network of bloggers, consultants, writers, authors, and social media voices who have come to the fore in the last few years, mainly since the 2008 presidential election. I’ve written about this network in this space several times (including last year’s boycott of Rush Limbaugh) and I agree that there may no more powerful group of organizers online, outside of political campaigns. Yet it’s essentially an ad hoc network; as author Allison Fine said last year “women aren’t waiting to be told what to do or which petition to sign, they’re just doing what we do best: talking and connecting.” The impact can be stunning: as the report notes, there were over 1.3 million tweets and $3 million was donated to Planned Parenthood within the first week of the Komen Foundation’s funding withdrawal last year.\\n\\nBut as Martin and Valenti point out, there is a fragility to this “leaderless” movement: “Its creation was largely accidental. The beginnings of online feminism were primarily in the form of online journals, websites, and blogs, developed in response to the need for a public platform where young women could voice their opinions about the state of the world around them.” And that platform grew with social media. The results are obvious to anyone to hangs out on Twitter or Facebook. Mainstream misogyny that used to slide by to smirks or quiet frustration now faces a withering full scale counter-attack. Companies have to be more responsive. Politicians face consequences. And the network can move public opinion – and rapidly.\\n\\nOf particular importance in the report is the section on “reclaiming the frame.” In a world on instant popular culture and ubiquitous rapid communication, you are what you say you are – but you’d better say it quickly. “Working within a media landscape drenched in reality shows and rape jokes is no easy feat for any feminist,” write Valenti and Martin, who run a consulting firm of the same name. “With women comprising only 22% of thought leadership in most mainstream media forums and only 3% of clout positions, it’s no surprise that pop culture and legacy news can be such sexist, racist, and homophobic environments.”\\n\\nYet the new frame, as they put, has been successful in using the sheer size and diversity of the feminist network to push back – pretty hard, in some cases – on the formerly dominant elements (at least in my view).\\n\\nAlthough the contemporary impact of online feminism is clear (and will certainly be felt in the next presidential race, for example) the future is muddier, says the report. “Online feminism may continue to grow and evolve, but whether it will reach the potential it needs to sustain itself—and make the real, transformative impact the world needs—is yet to be seen. An unfunded online feminist movement isn’t merely a threat to the livelihood of these hard-working activists, but a threat to the larger feminist movement itself. Without greater support, the online feminist movement faces a number of risks.”\\n\\nWhat’s needed, argue Martin and Valenti, is a series of efforts that combine money with strengthening real world structures for meeting, recruiting and action:\\n\\nTo avoid these pitfalls and embrace the opportunities ahead, the online community will have to be strategic and partner with a range of their feminist allies—advocacy and nonprofit organizations, philanthropists and entrepreneurs, corporate leadership with a feminist sensibility, educators, community organizers, artists, and youth—among so many others. It is time to strengthen the connective tissue between those who are most savvy and connected online, and those pushing feminist agendas in our courtrooms, classrooms, boardrooms, and beyond. The results could be profound.\\n\\nFor more on the report and reaction from the network, follow the #femfuture tag on Twitter or check in to onlinefeminism.com.',\n",

       "  'text': 'By JESSICA BENNETTMAY 16, 2014\\n\\nIt was a month before Gloria Steinem’s 80th birthday, but on a Saturday evening in February, on the cliffs at a resort in Southern California, 500 women were helping her celebrate early. Ms. Steinem, the guest of honor, was flanked by her longtime friends Marlo Thomas and Jane Fonda. The three hugged, and then Ms. Thomas raised a glass. “To Gloria,” she said. “The absolutely perfect leader to our revolution.”\\n\\nThe leadership summit, hosted by AOL and Makers, a multimedia women’s initiative, was devoted to “setting an agenda for change for women in the workplace.” For the last three days, attendees had viewed quite a show. They had listened to the former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords; Maria Klawe, the president of Harvey Mudd College; the astronaut Mae Jemison; and the comedian Chelsea Handler. They had done morning yoga, heard Martha Stewart talk about being overwhelmed by tech devices, and closed out the evening with a set from young female standup comics.\\n\\nFor some guests, it was their first time at an empowerment conference. For others, it was their first time being in a room with so many women at all. “My unit is 4,000 people, a majority men,” said Allison Cole, the regional president for Verizon New England, one of the event’s sponsors. “So I’ve never experienced anything quite like it. It really did feel like a sisterhood.”\\n\\nAnd for still others, it was just the first stop on the women’s event circuit, part of a broader conference industry that labor statistics predict will balloon over the next five years. No one seems to be counting, but here’s what may happen if they tried: There are women’s empowerment conferences for entrepreneurs, philanthropists, advertisers, bloggers, innovators, foodies, women in tech, lesbians in tech and girls who code. There are conferences out of which movements have grown (Sheryl Sandberg’s “Lean In” began as a talk at TedWomen) and those that aim to create them (the tagline for Politico’s Women Rule gathering is “Innovating a Movement”).\\n\\nThere are those focused on sustainable living, like Arianna Huffington and Mika Brzezinski’s Thrive, now in its second year. And those that have become news-making events like Tina Brown’s Women in the World summit, which just celebrated its fifth year. Forbes Women hosted one called Power Redefined last week; another, S.H.E. Summit, is set for June. Cosmopolitan magazine is to announce its conference series this week.\\n\\n“You could honestly spend your life going to these things,” said Asie Mohtarez, a 35-year-old comedy writer in New York, who attended Makers with a group of friends. “It’s almost become a competition, like: ‘Did you go to that conference? Well what about that one?’ And maybe you don’t even want to go, but now you have to because you’re afraid of what you’ll miss out on if you don’t.”\\n\\nIt may not be quite what their feminist foremothers imagined (fewer protests, more panels) and yet it is conference culture as consciousness-raising. What were once grass-roots gatherings have become commercial enterprises: star-studded events with corporate sponsors like Toyota and Walmart.\\n\\n“It’s the formation of a new girls’ club,” said Morra Aarons-Mele, a marketing consultant who advises companies on connecting with women. (She was speaking by phone, naturally, from a conference for female philanthropists.) “I mean, no offense, but men have been doing this kind of conference networking for years.”\\n\\nWomen have long gathered to talk about the issues of the day (think of Seneca Falls) — and for good reason. “It’s part of every social justice movement,” Ms. Steinem said in an interview at Makers.\\n\\nYet when it comes to for-profit, privately funded events, the audience has not always been there. Five years ago, when Ms. Brown, the editor of The Daily Beast at the time, pitched the idea of a conference on international women’s rights, “it was a very tough sell,” she said. She found one sponsor, Hewlett-Packard, and held the event at a small theater in Manhattan. Tickets were free.\\n\\nToday that conference fills 2,500 seats over three days at Lincoln Center, with offshoots in Brazil and cities around the country. At this year’s summit, panelists included women of the Arab Spring (interviewed by Jon Stewart), Pussy Riot, Queen Rania of Jordan, Jimmy Carter, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and the Silverman sisters (Sarah, a comedian, and Susan, a rabbi). An opening night conversation between Hillary Clinton and Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, culminated in a spontaneous high-five.\\n\\n“I think women are looking to be inspired,” Ms. Brown said of the gatherings. Madeleine Albright, one of Ms. Brown’s perennial hosts, added: “Really good ideas come when people are together having discussions. There is power in conversation.”\\n\\nThe commercial interest makes sense. Women have more spending power than ever, and corporations are searching for ways to reach them. Publications are looking for new sources of revenue. Conferences also fill a social void, as digital communication becomes the norm.\\n\\n“There’s nothing quite like being in a room with like-minded women working toward a common cause,” said Dyllan McGee, the founder and executive producer of Makers. Ms. Huffington has long spoken about the power of her all-lady “tribe,” that by being together and creating support groups, women will be able “to bring about change faster.” With Mrs. Clinton on one side and Ms. Sandberg on the other — and Beyoncé somewhere in between — feminism has become, well, cool.\\n\\n“This is the tsunami effect of Hillary,” said Glynnis MacNicol, a journalist and co-founder of TheLi.st, a women’s networking group. Her co-founder, Rachel Sklar, added: “There is such a hunger on the part of smart, accomplished women to be taken seriously. It’s refreshing to see conferences and the zeitgeist reflect that.”\\n\\nIt’s a free-market take on an age-old concept, complete with high-priced tickets and fancy gift bags. The fact that corporations want to be associated with women’s causes at all is certainly progress, said Jessica Valenti, a feminist writer who founded the website Feministing. And yet much as TED has been criticized as too elite, the women’s circuit is not without tension. Criticism has ranged from the price of entry to whether so much talk will actually lead to action.\\n\\nThere’s also the inevitable question of the track record of the sponsors involved. Merck, which was embroiled in a lawsuit over its contraceptive drug, NuvaRing, was among the sponsors at Ms. Brown’s event. And when Tim Armstrong, the chief executive of AOL, took the stage at Makers just days after his comments about the “distressed babies” of employees causing company health care costs to rise, there was a palpable silence in the room.\\n\\nBut even Ms. Steinem does not believe that has to undermine these events altogether. Describing the evolution of women’s gatherings, she said: “First it was something we put together ourselves, then it was something sponsored by a government, then it was something paid for by a corporation. And then we got a little bit more money and we moved into a fancier hotel.”\\n\\nOr Lincoln Center. At Women in the World this year, a lunchtime gathering included a mix of Columbia students, the founder of a nonprofit for Rwandan refugees, a young blogger from Pakistan and a grass-roots organizer from San Francisco who introduced himself as “the son of feminists” (two lesbians and a gay man).\\n\\nThese meetings “give us the sense that we’re communicating and connecting at a time when I think so many of us have felt so isolated,” said Barbara Berg, a historian and author of “Sexism in America.” “I think these conferences have capitalized on a yearning to be part of something.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'SHERYL SANDBERG is not one to settle for being the It Girl of Silicon Valley.\\n\\nNor is the chief operating officer of Facebook willing to write a book that people might merely read.\\n\\nOne of her friends from her Harvard days told Vogue that the brainy, beautiful, charming, stylish, happily married 43-year-old mother of two, one of the world’s richest self-made women, has an “infectious insistence.” (She would have to, having founded Harvard’s aerobics program in the ’80s, wearing blue eye shadow and leg warmers.)\\n\\nNow that she has domesticated the Facebook frat house, Sandberg wants to be “the pompom girl for feminism,” as she calls it. She has a grandiose plan to become the PowerPoint Pied Piper in Prada ankle boots reigniting the women’s revolution — Betty Friedan for the digital age. She wants women to stop limiting and sabotaging themselves.\\n\\nThe petite corporate star is larger than life, and a normal book tour for “Lean In,” which she describes as “sort of a feminist manifesto” mixed with career advice, just won’t do.\\n\\n“I always thought I would run a social movement,” she said in “Makers,” an AOL/PBS documentary on feminist history.\\n\\nSandberg may have caught the fever to change the world from Mark Zuckerberg, or come by it genetically. She writes that her mother, at age 11, responded to a rabbi’s sermon on tikkun olam, the Jewish concept of repairing the world, by “grabbing a tin can and knocking on doors to support civil rights workers in the South.”\\n\\nThe charmed Sandberg is no Queen Bee. Unlike some other women who reach the top, she does not pull up the ladder, or jungle gym, as she prefers to think of it, behind her. Many women found it inspiring when she said in “Makers” that she left work at 5:30 to go home to her kids, even while they acknowledged that you might have to be Sheryl Sandberg to get away with that.\\n\\nSandberg, who worked at the Treasury Department for her mentor, Larry Summers, and at Google before going to Facebook, started a group called the Women of Silicon Valley to listen to celebrity speakers and swap stories.\\n\\nShe knows there is slow evolution or even erosion in women’s progress in some areas, and that many younger women don’t want to be called feminists. Professional women often take their husbands’ last names these days without a thought.\\n\\nHer book is chockablock with good tips and insights, if a bit discouraging at times. She urges women in salary negotiations to smile frequently and use the word “we” instead of “I.” And she encourages employers and women to talk upfront about plans for children, which employers may fear is lawsuit fodder.\\n\\nShe seems to think she can remedy social paradigms with a new kind of club — a combo gabfest, Oprah session and corporate pep talk. (Where’s the yoga?)\\n\\nSandberg has been recruiting corporations to join her Lean In Foundation, which will create the Lean In Community and Lean In Circles, which are, as The Times’s Jodi Kantor wrote, like “consciousness-raising groups of yore.” The circles will entail 8 to 12 peers who will meet monthly and use “education modules” to learn the skills to pursue equality. (Like how Rosa Parks used bus modules.) The debut assignment is a video on how to command more authority by altering how you speak and sit.\\n\\nWomen are encouraged to send in stories about leaning in, but no sad sacks allowed: “Share a positive ending about what you learned from the experience,” says the instructional material for Lean In Circles. And no truants: “Don’t invite flakes.”\\n\\nThat leaves me leaning out.\\n\\nSandberg has already gotten some flak from women who think that her attitude is too elitist and that she is too prone to blame women for failing to get ahead. (Not everyone has Larry Page and Sergey Brin volunteering to baby-sit, and Zuckerberg offering a shoulder to cry on.) Noting that her Facebook page for “Lean In” looks more like an ego wall with “deep thoughts,” critics argue that her unique perch as a mogul with the world’s best husband to boot makes her tone-deaf to the problems average women face as they struggle to make ends meet in a rough economy, while taking care of kids, aging parents and housework.\\n\\nSandberg describes taking her kids to a business conference last year and realizing en route that her daughter had head lice. But the good news was that she was on the private eBay jet.\\n\\nSandberg may mean well, and she may be setting up a run for national office. But she doesn’t understand the difference between a social movement and a social network marketing campaign. Just because digital technology makes connecting possible doesn’t mean you’re actually reaching people.\\n\\nPeople come to a social movement from the bottom up, not the top down. Sandberg has co-opted the vocabulary and romance of a social movement not to sell a cause, but herself.\\n\\nShe says she’s using marketing for the purpose of social idealism. But she’s actually using social idealism for the purpose of marketing.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Reading the variety of reasons that women gave for being opposed to feminism in the much-debated #WomenAgainstFeminism social media campaign is one of the most profoundly depressing experiences I’ve had for a while.\\n\\nThe reason is a fairly basic one. In some ways, it doesn’t much matter whether or not those women choose to define themselves as feminists, or anything else for that matter.\\n\\nThe reality is that at some point in their lives these women – most of them still quite young, to judge by the photos of themselves they post alongside their reasons for rejecting the feminist label – are going to realize that “feminist” issues are not other people’s problems. From birth control to the wage gap to financial savvy, the “feminist” issues are the everyday obstacles that will shape the lives of young women too.\\n\\nThe Women against Feminism campaign is particularly unsettling because it suggests that lessons have been lost. Jane O’Reilly wrote about some of them in her iconic 1971 essay about the radicalization of the American housewife.\\n\\nIt’s a matter of time. Nearly every women is likely to encounter the same kind of “click” moment that Jane O’Reilly so evocatively describes. Perhaps it won’t involve housework.\\n\\nOpen contributions: What do you think?\\n\\nDon’t laugh: stereotypes like these, and not just a lack of women studying math and sciences, mean math, engineering and science programs struggle to recruit women to study fields that will put them on the path to earning higher incomes.\\n\\nA key thing to understand is that feminism is not necessarily about demonizing men as oppressive beings. Men can be feminists too, if they support equality.\\n\\nSince this is the Money page, let’s put the sexual politics – reproductive health, sexual violence and related issues – to one side.\\n\\nLet’s focus squarely on the economic issues, because feminism is an economic issue. Feminism is about recognizing the facts that govern the economic existence of women: we earn less, we save less, we live longer.\\n\\nIt may be nice to wear interesting eyeliner and have nice clothes, but it’s less fun if you have to ask a man or your parents for the money, thus giving them financial power over your look, your life and your decisions.\\n\\nSome things to consider before dismissing feminism: its whole point is to empower you to stand on your own two feet financially. You will need that – even if you don’t think so now.\\n\\nIf you’re a woman, you’re going to make less than you would if you were a man. This is not necessarily because women prefer lower-paying jobs as teachers or nurses to have flexibility. Even if you’re a doctor, it’s likely you’ll earn 71 cents on the dollar compared to your male peers, well below the average of 77 cents. There is even some research suggesting that the gender pay gap for younger women may be widening, in spite of the fact that on average, they are emerging from college better prepared to compete equally with their male counterparts.\\n\\nMaybe it’s semantics. Don’t call yourself a feminist, if the label seems offensive in some way. But you should think like a feminist – which to me means believing that you’re entitled to equal pay for work of equal value, to equal opportunities for employment and advancement, to being viewed as a first-class citizen by both employers and employees.\\n\\nTo the extent that feminists has earned a reputation for not being nice – and heavens, even a bit abrasive – it’s precisely because any time you’re part of a group that is operating at an economic disadvantage, and you start speaking up about it and trying to change things, playing nice simply doesn’t work.\\n\\nWhen Emily Davison threw herself under the hooves of George V’s horse at Epsom Derby in 1913, it wasn’t because dying for the cause of a women’s right to vote her first strategic choice. It was the outcome of years of increasingly active attempts to change an inequitable power structure. Revolutions don’t start quietly, and change is usually hard-won through relentless effort.\\n\\nIn North America and Europe today, we’re in a position of tremendous luxury. Many of us will never be told, outright, that we can’t or shouldn’t do something simply because we’re women. That’s common in other cultures, so we feel protected in the west. I trace my own willingness to call myself a feminist to the moment at my Japanese graduate school where a professor told me that I was not allowed to speak in the seminar class he taught, because I was a woman; the university’s authorities had no problem with this stance. Click.\\n\\nOur relative privilege doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t be aware of the ways in which our gender affects our economic wellbeing. In my next column, I’ll discuss some practical ways to avoid having that happen – whatever label you choose to wear.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Elaine Showalter is professor emerita of English and humanities at Princeton University. She is writing a biography of Julia Ward Howe.\\n\\n‘I am not a postfeminism feminist. I am the Third Wave,” Yale senior Rebecca Walker proclaimed in January 1992, calling on her generation via Ms. magazine to claim its place in feminist history and to reanimate a women’s movement that seemed dated, if not defunct.\\n\\nThe daughter of novelist Alice Walker and the goddaughter of Gloria Steinem, Rebecca Walker had grown up with a feminism as normal and invisible as fluoride in the water; but even those contemporaries who lacked her exceptional opportunities had lived their entire lives in a culture shaped by the women’s movement, and had come of age with contraception and legal abortion. They took feminism for granted or dismissed it as irrelevant.\\n\\nBut that attitude changed, Walker wrote, when young women became outraged by the spectacle of Anita Hill testifying on sexual harassment before 14 skeptical white male members of the Senate Judiciary Committee during the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings. Now, she declared, they needed to wake up, “turn that outrage into political power” and continue the fight.\\n\\nBy naming her feminist generation the Third Wave, Walker followed the standard historical description of periods of American feminism as “waves,” intense surges of political activism followed by tranquil decades of consolidation, backlash or retreat. The first wave was the suffrage movement, culminating in the ratification of the 19th Amendment on Aug. 18, 1920. Fifty years later, in the second wave, American women came together to fight for equal rights to education, employment, housing and protection under the law.\\n\\n“Feminism Unfinished,” however, argues that the “wave” metaphor obscures the history of a continuous American women’s movement sustained by labor activists, civil rights advocates and \\xadsocial-reform campaigners, who may have looked placid on the surface but were paddling like hell underneath. Each of the three authors contributes a chapter to their history of American feminism, and they declare together in their prologue that “there was no period in the last century in which women were not campaigning for greater equality and freedom.” They hope that uncovering the “multiple and unfinished feminisms of the twentieth century can inspire” the women’s movements of the 21st. That’s the surprise signaled in the teasing subtitle.\\n\\nYet the book’s position on the potential for another American women’s movement is more cautious and qualified than the title suggests. The real surprise is that the authors believe that the United States “no longer serves as a world leader when it comes to gender equality” and that the future of feminism may be global rather than American.\\n\\nIn her chapter on “Feminism After Suffrage,” Dorothy Sue Cobble, a professor of history and labor studies at Rutgers, explores the history of American women in the labor movement and civil rights organizations in the decades after the 19th Amendment. She calls the working-class, minority and leftist women in these campaigns “social justice feminists,” who saw economic fairness as the most important key to an egalitarian society. Ironically, the greatest achievement for women during this period was the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, after Rep. Howard Smith, a Virginia conservative, laughingly proposed adding “sex” to the regulations forbidding discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion or national origin. Social-justice feminists opposed Smith’s “Sex Amendment,” which they saw as a strategy to delay, dilute or destroy the bill. And in 1966, when NOW (the National Organization for Women) was founded by Pauli Murray and Betty Friedan as an “NAACP for women,” many social-justice feminists resisted an alliance overtly based on women’s rights. A “feminism” that dared not speak its name was hardly a women’s movement.\\n\\nIn her chapter on “The Women’s Liberation Moment,” Linda Gordon, a professor of history and humanities at New York University, gives long-overdue credit to NOW for its stability, discipline and longevity. She also explains the importance of consciousness-raising in the 1970s. Many women were unaware of their limited opportunities or secondary roles as political problems. Small, leaderless groups, in which women came together to talk about their lives, led them to realize that “the personal was political,” that their intimate and private experiences in the family, school, workplace, sexuality, marriage and divorce were shared by millions of other women. These epiphanies were then channeled into political organization, coalitions and effective action. The women’s liberation movement also educated further generations through women’s studies programs, books, manifestos and magazines.\\n\\nIn 1973, two major Supreme Court decisions — one that banned sex-segregated employment ads, and the famous Roe v. Wade, making abortion legal — had an immediate and lasting impact on women’s lives. Gordon is the only contributor who relates feminism to her own career: “All three of us college professors writing this book, like all professional women and college students, benefited directly from feminism and the affirmative action programs pushed by the movement.”\\n\\nIn the most instructive and challenging chapter, “From a Mindset to a Movement,” Astrid Henry, a professor of women’s studies at Grinnell, traces the development of American feminism since the 1990s. Twenty-first-century feminism is multiracial and multicultural; it links to LGBT groups and protests the global issues of sexual oppression and violence against women. At the same time, it enjoys and endorses new images of women in pop culture, and plays with fashion, make-up and personal style as self-expression. “Unlike my first- and second-wave predecessors,” one fashionista explains, “no one force-fed me femininity. . . . I had to fight for it tooth and nail.” These women rely on e-mail, blogs and Twitter to attract followers and build community awareness. “We began our activism online,” another notes. “Blogs are our consciousness-raising groups.” Some contemporary feminists are concerned with the major American failure to implement family-friendly policies such as state-subsidized child care and paid parental leaves. As the Washington writer Ann Crittenden has pointed out, “This is the big unfinished business of the women’s movement.”\\n\\nBut Henry also admits that “the most defining feature of this generation of feminists is its inability to be defined by any single political goal, ideological perspective, or way of being feminist.” Hashtag feminism “runs the risk of being merely an identity to claim without any political content.” Perhaps, Henry suggests, the diversity and flexibility of “a million little grass-roots movements” are stronger than “one singular vision for social change.” She points to demonstrations, foundations and fundraising as examples of 21st-century feminist activism. Still, she acknowledges concerns that “feminism as a concept is now so watered-down as to be meaningless.”\\n\\nI share that concern. In my view, a mass movement requires a clear goal, compelling enough to unite people across the dividing lines of race, class, age, religion, sexual orientation and ethnicity, and to persuade them to work collectively to achieve it. The goal must be concrete and attainable, even if its ideological underpinnings are complex or contradictory. A movement also requires charismatic leaders to galvanize its adherents into effective action.\\n\\nBut what goal unites American women now? Which leaders inspire us? As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg recently said, women’s autonomy and dignity in the United States are being undermined and eroded just when gay rights are getting overdue attention and respect. Feminism unfinished, American women’s movement finished, would be a sad epitaph to a glorious history.\\n\\nElaine Showalter is professor emerita of English and humanities at Princeton University.

I’m afraid it would deliver the unintended, unfortunate message that feminists are old, fat and slovenly.\\n\\nGene Weingarten is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and writes \"Below the Beltway,\" a weekly humor column that is nationally syndicated.\\n\\n2. Women, being smart and savvy, no doubt understand that roughly 75 percent of all men wearing those shirts are doing so solely to improve their chances of getting lucky.\\n\\nSo you won’t see me in one, but I do believe in most everything feminists believe, and with equal conviction. I am certainly not one of those people who look for any excuse to stereotype women in any way, which is why I am very troubled by two recent developments.\\n\\nDevelopment One: In advance of a public debate about rape, activists at Brown University created a “safe space” that women could go to if the subject made them feel anxious. According to the New York Times, it was a room equipped with coloring books, bubble blowers, Play-Doh and “a video of frolicking puppies.” Development Two occurred on Twitter during a national conference for young women. An organizer tweeted out a request that people in the audience hold their applause, substituting “jazz hands,” which is apparently a silent affirmation achieved by raising ones palms, fingers splayed and wiggling. Why the switch? Because raucous clapping and “whooping” were triggering anxiety in some attendees.\\n\\nSo, I started Making Harsh Judgments, which bothered me. As I often do when I need help with understanding female things, I have invited ...\\n\\nGene: Shh. I haven’t introduced you yet.\\n\\nGina: Hi, I’m Gina Barreca, a professor and expert on feminist literature. Gene calls on me not when he wants to better understand something, but when he needs my cred to cover his butt when he’s afraid he’s about to sound like a total misogynist. Presumably he will now ask me something.\\n\\nGene: Yes. Please defend these two things I have just discussed. Tell me why they don’t reflect badly on young women.\\n\\nGina: Sure. My answer is in two parts. Part one is to note that I do not endorse the modern Delicate Flower way of life, which, by the way, is not limited to young women. The story of the Princess and the Pea is exactly what it is: a fairy tale. You aren’t a more worthy person just because you are easily upset. If you feel the pea, you find it and get rid of it, or you sleep on the floor. You don’t make yourself a terrible houseguest by whining about how uncomfortable you are. If you want to sit at the grown-ups’ table and use metal cutlery and drink from anything apart from a sippy cup, then you bravely face your fears and anxieties; you don’t demand the world accommodate you. That’s point one. Point two involves these events reflecting badly on young women. Do you personally identify with any particular ethnic or religious culture?\\n\\nGene: Culturally, I am Jewish.\\n\\nGina: And are you any particular gender?\\n\\nGene: Checking. Hang on. Okay, I am male.\\n\\nGina: Fine. Please defend Jewish males in light of the loathsome and detestable crimes of Bernard Madoff and Julius Rosenberg.\\n\\nGene: That’s a ridiculous and insulting question.\\n\\nGina: Nice talking to you, doll.\\n\\nFor stories, features such as Date Lab, @Work Advice and more, visit WP Magazine.\\n\\nFollow the Magazine on Twitter.',\n",

However, her success in Hollywood hasn\\'t made her immune to the same difficulties faced by other actresses who dared to age past 30, and in a new interview she\\'s speaking out against ageism and sexism in show business.\\n\\n\"The age thing is insane,\" Thompson, 56, recently\\n\\n. \"It was ever thus. I remember saying years and years ago, when I was 35, that they\\'d have to exhume somebody to play my leading man. â\\x80¦ Nothing\\'s changed in that regard. If anything, it\\'s got worse.\"\\n\\nIn the piece, Thompson recalls filming 1995\\'s\\n\\n, which she was nominated twice – for acting and for writing the screenplay. (She won in the latter category.) The film co-starred\\n\\n. \"I remember somebody saying to me that I was too old for Hugh Grant, who\\'s like a year younger than me,\" Thompson said. \"I said, \\'Do you want to go take a flying leap?\\' \"\\n\\nAs Thompson sees it, women working in Hollywood should be working together to level the playing field – and as a result, she\\'s perplexed by younger actresses saying they\\n\\n\"It\\'s bizarre. Any woman who says they\\'re not a feminist is basically saying that they don\\'t believe in equal rights for women,\" Thompson said. \"I\\'ve been a card-carrying, radical feminist since I was 19.\"\\n\\nTo her, women in the spotlight have an obligation to act as ambassadors to the cause when speaking publicly. \"Any woman who says, \\'I hate my bum, I hate my body,\\' is essentially expressing a kind of misogyny,\" she said. \"All women who come up with that need to think very carefully about what it is they\\'re saying. Including me!\"\\n\\nFinally, Thompson said she is not wowed by the current trend of blockbuster superhero movies. (\"If I see yet another\\n\\n, I\\'m going to have to actually hang myself,\" she jokes.) However, there is one superhero she feels still deserves a big moment in the spotlight: \"I\\'m up for Wonder Woman, totally.\"\\n\\nThompson\\'s next major projects are writing the script for the upcoming sequel\\n\\nand appearing in the live-action\\n\\n, in which she will play a talking teapot.',\n",

       "  'date': '20160721011529',\n",
       "  'text': 'Being a feminist in 2016 is a strange thing. You are at once riding the wave of a radical social movement turned trendy (Beyoncé dancing in front of a flashing Feminist sign, Taylor Swift declaring her bona fides) and watching as the political realm struggles to keep up with, or actively tries to smack down, women’s progress (a renewed interest in federally funded child care but also unprecedented restrictions on women’s health care). The most serious female contender for the White House is facing off against an opponent running on intransigent masculinity; she still answers for her husband’s behavior, while he complains about women playing “the woman’s card” with his third, decades-younger wife standing at his side. Who uses which bathroom is suddenly a matter of great political concern. Abortion is back before the Supreme Court.\\n\\nThus, feminism itself is enjoying a resurgence, spurred on by young feminist writers. Two of those writers, Jessica Valenti, a founder of Feministing.com and now a columnist at the Guardian, and Lindy West, formerly of the blog Jezebel and now also at the Guardian, recently published memoirs: Sex Object by Valenti and Shrill: Notes From a Loud Woman by West.\\n\\nFull disclosure: Valenti is a friend, and West is someone I’ve interviewed. Fuller disclosure: when I heard they were both writing memoirs, my initial reaction was to wonder why the world needed another memoir from someone who, I hoped, had not lived even half her life yet. (Valenti is 37 and West 34.) I should have been more generous.\\n\\nThere’s a power in reading these books together, at this moment in the culture, to see how the same sexist roots can grow different weeds. Both West and Valenti are harassed, objectified, treated as if their presence is an invitation for men to evaluate them as sexual goods, but their experiences play out differently. As a teenager, Valenti encounters men who masturbate on her in the subway; West has men tell her she’s too fat to rape. Both women grow up in a world that wants them to be small and quiet, and both refuse. For both, that privilege comes at a personal cost.\\n\\nIn Shrill, West writes in the same comic voice that brought her legions of fans at Jezebel. It’s a joke-a-sentence pace, tinged with West’s dismay at the hate she endures both for her work and for her body. “When I looked in the mirror, I could never understand what was supposedly so disgusting,” she writes. “I knew I was smart, funny, talented, social, kind–why wasn’t that enough?” Her humor is both a tool to promote her feminism and a shield against the blowback, but that tone starts to flag at the end when she writes about the abuse that came after she criticized rape jokes in comedy. When comic peers failed to stand by her side, West’s crushing disappointment breaks through her jokey tenor, showing the myriad ways a sexist culture squelches even the brightest women.\\n\\nIn Sex Object, that flattening is obvious from the get-go, and the sardonic voice Valenti cultivated as a blogger is nowhere to be found, replaced by frustration-tinged sincerity and sometimes just sadness. Reading anecdotes of how people, mostly men, tried to make Valenti’s existence dimmer was both illuminating and draining–and on a very human level made me exceptionally sad for my bighearted, vivid friend and women like her.\\n\\nNotably, both women write about their abortions, both without regret but with a complexity of emotion often absent in politicized battles. Both note the importance of being able to make that particular choice at that particular time—how ending a pregnancy kept so many doors open. For Valenti, “The abortion marked the last in a succession of decisions to take hold of a life that was increasingly careening out of control”; after it came the publication of her first book, the end of a drug habit, meeting the man she would marry, having her daughter. West, too, made great professional and personal strides because she chose not to become a mother just then; she stopped hating her body, fell in love with her future husband, took a life-changing job, eventually wrote this book. Having an abortion was not, West writes, “intrinsically significant, but it was my first big grown-up decision—the first time I asserted, unequivocally, ‘I know the life that I want and this isn’t it’: the moment I stopped being a passenger in my own body and grabbed the rudder.”\\n\\nThis month, the Supreme Court is set to rule on the biggest abortion case in two decades. The case, Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, challenges several Texas laws that make it harder for women to obtain abortions and harder for doctors to provide them, and shut down most of the abortion clinics in the state. The decision is expected to outline just how far states can go in restricting abortion rights—necessary guidance, given the 288 restrictions on the procedure enacted since 2010. After the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, women’s health advocates are no longer worried that this case could be a vehicle to overturn Roe v. Wade. Still, it’s a white-knuckler: If the Texas restrictions are upheld, even just in the Fifth Circuit (Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi), more states could follow suit, and for many American women abortion could become little more than a right written on paper.\\n\\nIn an attempt to illustrate for the justices that abortion is a normal medical procedure tens of millions of American women have relied on—a procedure that has allowed them to stay in school, fall in love, escape abuse, raise the children they already have, parent children when they are ready—a group of female lawyers submitted their own abortion stories to the Court. Many of them are like West’s and Valenti’s, not exactly happy but not particularly painful; others are harder, about a pregnancy gone wrong or a life suddenly gone sideways. They are all stories of profound gratitude, of opportunities not foreclosed upon, of the power in voicing what women are told should bring silence and shame. Reading them, I recognized a few names: A successful former classmate, a civil rights crusader I once interviewed for a story, one of my professors from law school.\\n\\nThis is not the first time women have spoken out about their abortions—before Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, abortion speak-outs were a part of pro-choice advocacy, and Ms. magazine famously published a list of prominent women who had ended their pregnancies. But at a moment when it seems like everyone is a feminist and yet the fundamental right to decide whether or not to stay pregnant is again up for debate, reading these stories—the lawyers’ brief and the ones in these books—feels like peeling back old skin. Such declarations exist both because of the paths forged by feminists decades ago and because of a public increasingly open to women’s voices—a new atmosphere created partly by West, Valenti and other feminists who have long weathered sexist blows just to be able to keep talking.\\n\\nFilipovic is a writer and lawyer',\n",

In a nod to her group\\'s mission to encourage men to advocate for women\\'s rights, she graces the magazine\\'s cover alongside\\n\\n, her costar in the thriller\\n\\n, due later this year.\\n\\n\"If you look at his career,\" explains Watson, \"a lot of his biggest movies –\\n\\n– have been with female directors. And also there\\'s something about the way he talks about issues, whether it be gay rights, AIDS, environmental issues, children or the work he does with veterans, he speaks with such a humble grace and a credible voice.\"\\n\\nWatson, too, has a credible voice, particularly in the realm of gender equality. She speaks forthrightly on issues from slipping up and calling a room full of women \"guys,\" to the pay gap in Hollywood.\\n\\n\"We are not supposed to talk about money, because people will think you\\'re \\'difficult\\' or a \\'diva.\\' But there\\'s a willingness now to be like, \\'Fine.

I don\\'t talk about these experiences much, because coming from me they\\'ll sound like a huge deal and I don\\'t want this to be about me, but most women I know have experienced it and worse.\"\\n\\nThe solution, she says, is for men to get involved. \"There\\'s no point in me going, \\'You all have to go away from having read this article and decide that you are a feminist.\\' That\\'s useless. The only thing that is going to make a difference is if men go away and speak to the women in their lives about what they are experiencing.',\n",

But then I don\\'t wanna say too much. They\\'re like, \"Oh, what are you doing?\" Then it would lead to back to, \"Oh, I\\'m a singer.\" I don\\'t need to have that conversation five times a day.

I\\'m a buckeye, man; I am what I am.\\n\\nNone of the stuff I loved growing up was mainstream. You had to find it for yourself, and that turned you on.

Nothing\\'s cool.\\n\\nFrankly, after all the reality television and after all the talent shows for people who aren\\'t very talented, judged by people who have no taste ... For all this stuff that you see, none of it – for an 18-year-old kid – could be better than picking up a guitar, getting on the drum kit, and just bashing it out with your mates.

I really admire people who can manage to keep their thing alive and not be in the glare of this. You don\\'t see her on the cover of magazines and stuff. You don\\'t have to play the game. Everyone has to do certain things every day that they don\\'t necessarily want to do, to cross the street. But I think a lot of people do it their own way and maintain their dignity.\\n\\nThings like having dignity with what you do, keeping your integrity. Decency: There\\'s a word you don\\'t hear anymore. You say \"decency,\" and you\\'re like, \"Ooh, what\\'s your problem?\" It\\'s unbelievable. Values are no longer valued. And I think that\\'s gonna turn around because these are the things that speak to people ... women who call themselves feminists. And they are feminists, but they\\'re feminists on behalf of the sex trade. They\\'re there for sex workers. It\\'s very confusing, the messages that go out with words like \"empowerment\" and all that. How about just getting good at what you do and keeping your mouth shut for a while? Just learn your craft and get out there. I\\'m not talkin\\' about anyone specific at all. There\\'s just a lot of that going on, and a lot of hysteria.\\n\\nWell, obviously, standing up on behalf of your fellow man or woman and seeing that they\\'re treated fairly in any regard is a noble cause. That\\'s too broad of a thing to...\\n\\nWhat does it mean to me? It\\'s a very broad spectrum ... It depends on what country you\\'re in. You\\'re talking about human rights. You\\'re talking about a lot of things. So. Of course I think it\\'s noble to stand up and try to help your fellow man. Of course, I would get in trouble for saying \"your fellow man\" – your fellow man\\n\\n. You gotta be so careful with what you say now.\\n\\nNo, it hasn\\'t. It hasn\\'t.\\n\\nI know it\\'s not. Of course it\\'s not. That\\'s another myth that they try to perpetuate. Of course it hasn\\'t always been. Up until birth control, women were shackled to ... They were a lot busier at home.\\n\\nNot at all. Not at all. I think if anything, men – and I\\'m very experienced in this; I know what I\\'m talking about. Men like when women do this. They think it\\'s fascinating. I tell ya right now, if a woman walked in here and looked like\\n\\nand played like Jimi Hendrix, there\\'s not a band in the world that wouldn\\'t be falling to her feet and saying, \"Will you be in my band?\"\\n\\nMen like it when women can play guitar. Prince had all women in his band. Jeff Beck likes working with women. These were the greatest guitar players alive.\\n\\nI donâ\\x80\\x99t know where this myth comes from. All any guy in any band wants to do is sound as good as he can. And if anyone can make that happen, he wants that to happen. They\\'re not restricted of anything – sexual orientation, race, creed, none of that. None of that means anything. \"If you make me sound good, please be in my band.\" And that\\'s for sure. So.\\n\\nNo, never. Not in music. Not at all. The only thing that ever held me back was myself, because I was shy; I was embarrassed to play in front of guys; I didn\\'t think I was very good. They were always like, \"Come on, come on!\" I was always the one like, \"Uhhh.\" But no. So sue me! But no one tried to hold me back or gave me a hard time. [Laughs]\\n\\nIt\\'s fun! It\\'s exactly the same as always. No other reason at all. I\\'m not trying to increase my audience. I\\'m not trying to win anyone over. I\\'m not trying to live on past laurels. I really don\\'t want to be out there unless what I\\'m doing feels relevant, for the moment. But I\\'m also aware of the fact that people who are 60 now, it goes into the realm of \"the classics\" because you had something out for a while, and that\\'s what people want to hear. I don\\'t really question it.\\n\\nWhen you find the thing that you wanna do and that you like doing – and you get to do it – why would you stop doing it? I don\\'t have a goal. The only goal I have is to do it. I don\\'t care what happens around it.',\n",

       "  'text': 'THE O.J. Simpson trial is one reflection of how domestic violence haunts American society. Is \"Gone With the Wind\" another? Specifically, did Rhett Butler rape or, less offensively, ravish Scarlett O\\'Hara?\\n\\nThe debate began a few years back in academic journals and the lecture hall between two feminist philosophers -- one of them Christina Hoff Sommers, who has since outraged many feminists with her book \"Who Stole Feminism? How Women Betrayed Women,\" published last year. The argument in her book -- that feminism is dominated by those who seek to persuade the public that American women \"are not the free creatures we think we are\" -- is foreshadowed in the dispute over Margaret Mitchell\\'s Civil War saga.\\n\\nIn case you missed it, the debate has resurfaced again. Here are excerpts. TOM KUNTZ\\n\\nFrom a speech given last fall to the American Enterprise Institute by Ms. Sommers, an associate professor of philosophy at Clark University in Worcester, Mass., and reprinted in the current issue of The American Enterprise:\\n\\nUntil 1989, I was an academic feminist in good standing. My essays were included in female anthologies. I was invited to feminist conferences. My courses were cross-listed with Women\\'s Studies. I ran afoul of the feminist establishment when I published an essay in the Chronicle of Higher Education that said something politically incorrect about the famous staircase scene in \"Gone With the Wind.\"\\n\\n\"Many women,\" I wrote, \"continue to enjoy the sight of Rhett Butler carrying Scarlett O\\'Hara up the stairs in a fate undreamt of in feminist philosophy.\"\\n\\nI meant that to be both lighthearted and a serious warning that feminist theorists were out of touch with women. However, my remark incensed [ members of ] the Society for Women in Philosophy. . . . [ At a meeting of the society ] the feminist philosopher Marilyn Friedman would read a paper showing once and for all how my views were treasonable to women.\\n\\nThe paper by Ms. Friedman, associate professor of philosophy at Washington University in St. Louis, appeared in the Journal of Social Philosophy (Fall/Winter 1990):\\n\\nSommers\\' remark that Scarlett O\\'Hara\\'s rape by Rhett Butler is a fate undreamt of in feminist philosophy is . . . simply stunning. (Note that Sommers does not use the word \"rape\" here -- one of many omissions in her writings.) Even a passing knowledge of feminist philosophy reveals that rape is hardly undreamt of in it. Rape, of course, is not a dream; it is a nightmare. Any form of sexual aggression can involve coercion, intimidation, degradation, physical abuse, battering, and, in extreme cases, death.\\n\\nThe reality of rape is rendered invisible by the many novels and films, such as \"Gone With the Wind,\" which romanticize and mystify it. They portray the rapist as a handsome man whose domination is pleasurable in bed, and portray women as happy to have their own sexual choices and refusals crushed by such men.\\n\\nIn a culture in which these sorts of betrayals are routine, it is no surprise that this scene arouses the sexual desire of some men. The name of Richard Speck, to take one example, can remind us that all rape is not the pleasurable fantasy intimated in \"Gone With the Wind.\" To put the point graphically: would \"many women\" still swoon over Butler\\'s rape of O\\'Hara if they knew he urinated on her? When you\\'re the victim of a rape, you don\\'t have much choice over what goes on.\\n\\nTo which Ms. Sommers responded in a speech at the same gathering, and reprinted in the same journal:\\n\\nAt the time I made the remark, I was unacquainted with a book that has since come into my hands called \"Scarlett\\'s Women: \\'Gone With the Wind\\' and its Female Fans.\" The feminist author, Helen Taylor, actually did a survey of women who read \"Gone With the Wind\" or saw the movie asking them what they thought happened between Rhett and Scarlett . . .:\\n\\n\" [ T ] he majority of my correspondents (and I agree) recognize the ambiguous nature of the encounter and interpret it as a scene of mutually pleasurable rough sex . . . By far the majority of the women who responded to me saw the episode as erotically exciting, emotionally stirring and profoundly memorable. Few of them referred to it as \"rape.\\' \" . . .\\n\\nSome of you might find Friedman\\'s perverse insistence on rape simply stunning. Well I too find it perverse but I am not stunned. I read quite a lot of what the gender feminists write. And I have learned that they almost always interpret a text in a way that puts the most humiliating construction on women\\'s experiences with men. The gender feminist \"subtext\" of almost everything written about men and women in the patriarchy is rape, prostitution, debasement. . . .\\n\\nRebutting Ms. Sommers\\'s rebuttal of her rebuttal, Ms. Friedman wrote an article for the same issue of the journal:\\n\\nConsider the crucial scene. . . . From the moment of Rhett Butler\\'s first appearance in the novel, his physical power is emphasized: his large size, powerful build and excessive muscularity. . . . O\\'Hara and Butler eventually marry, but their relationship is far from blissful. . . . [ Butler warns ] : \"I\\'m riding you with a slack rein, my pet, but don\\'t forget that I\\'m riding with curb and spur just the same.\" When O\\'Hara expresses her desire to have no more children, [ clearly implying ] that she wishes no further sexual relations, they quarrel. Says O\\'Hara, \"I shall lock my door every night.\" Responded Butler, \"Why bother? If I wanted you, no lock would keep me out.\" This sounds to me like a verbal threat of rape. Is it merely my own \"humiliating construction\" to see it so?\\n\\nThe controversial sexual encounter develops after a drinking bout in which Butler becomes progressively more violent and intimidating. . . .\\n\\n\" \\'Observe my hands, my dear,\\' he said, flexing them. . . . \\'I could tear you to pieces with them with no trouble whatsoever and I would do it if it would take Ashley out of your mind. But it wouldn\\'t. So I think I\\'ll remove him from your mind forever this way. I\\'ll put my hands, so, on each side of your head and I\\'ll smash your skull between them like a walnut and that will blot him out.\\' \" . . .\\n\\n\"He swung her off her feet into his arms and started up the stairs. Her head was crushed against his chest. . . . He hurt her and she cried out. . . . Up the stairs, he went in the utter darkness, up, up, and she was wild with fear. . . . He stopped suddenly on the landing and, turning her swiftly in his arms, bent over her and kissed her with a savagery and a completeness that wiped out everything from her mind but the dark into which she was sinking and the lips on hers.\" . . .\\n\\nBy the time Butler gets to genital penetration, O\\'Hara is sexually aroused. Whether or not that makes her a willing participant is a further debatable point. Since it is debatable (although I would argue for the negative), [ the ] narrow notion of rape does not apply automatically. However, I use the term \"rape\" in a wider sense, in which it refers to any very intimate sexual contact which is initiated forcibly or against the will of the recipient. Perhaps . . . we should refer to this wider notion as \"sexual domination.\" . . .\\n\\nYes, O\\'Hara becomes aroused by the encounter. That is precisely what some feminist theorists have objected to: she becomes aroused by being sexually dominated. . . .\\n\\nIn her own words of recollection the next morning, as written by Margaret Mitchell, O\\'Hara has been \"humbled,\" \"hurt,\" and \"used . . . brutally.\" O\\'Hara, it seems to me, has a more credible understanding of her own experience than does Sommers. . . .\\n\\nNot to be outdone, Ms. Sommers responded in the journal the following spring:\\n\\nIn her second go at me Friedman has changed her tune about what did take place. She no longer compares Rhett Butler to Richard Speck and she acknowledges that the \"narrow notion\" of \"rape\" may not apply. . . . Thus Friedman insists that even when \"no\" turns to \"yes,\" a rape has occurred. . . . She now finds herself in the position of conceding to the macho male the sexist thesis that women like the idea of being raped (in the \"wider sense\").\\n\\nPhoto: Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh in \"Gone With the Wind.\" (MGM)',\n",

Wielding a military-style knife with a 7-inch-long blade, her assailant, as yet unknown, stabbed her four times.\\n\\nOn April 4, 1992, the Harvard Law Review held its annual gala banquet, when the torch of the nation\\'s most prestigious legal journal is passed to a new generation of editors. Among those invited: the murdered woman\\'s husband, Gerald Frug, a member of the Harvard Law School faculty. Had he attended, he would have found on his plate a parody of his wife\\'s last article. The parody, titled \"He-Manifesto of Post-Mortem Legal Feminism,\" was produced by the Law Review\\'s editors and paid for by the school. It depicted Ms. Frug as a humorless, sex-starved mediocrity and dubbed her the \"Rigor-Mortis Professor of Law.\"\\n\\nThe alleged satire poses a question that is certain to outlast all the finger-pointing, ducking, blaming, petitioning and posturing that has overtaken Cambridge in the nearly two weeks since the \"joke\" came to light: how can Harvard\\'s best and brightest, the men and women who will soon write the opinions of some of the nation\\'s most powerful judges, also be its cruelest and crudest?\\n\\nEarlier this year, Ms. Frug\\'s article, \"A Postmodern Feminist Legal Manifesto (An Unfinished Draft),\" appeared posthumously in the Harvard Law Review. Several conservative editors fought unsuccessfully to block the piece, a bluntly worded examination of how, Ms. Frug maintained, the law perpetuated the subjugation of women.\\n\\nAs the banquet approached, the Law Review\\'s editors, their coveted, career-making judicial clerkships in hand, turned their efforts to the Harvard Law Revue, an annual send-up of the publication. Along with others who had opposed publication of the Frug article, Craig Coben and Kenneth Fenyo set about to lampoon it.\\n\\nThe result was a five-page, footnote-laden parody, saturated with inside jokes and sexual innuendoes. The article was purportedly dictated \"from beyond the grave\" by one Mary Doe, described as the \"Rigor-Mortis Professor of Law, New England School of Law, 1981-1991\" and \"wife of Gerald Frug, Professor of Law, Harvard Law School.\" In it, Ms. Doe recounts childhood sexual fantasies about men in tight swim trunks, defended the use of obscenities in her scholarly work, and reflected on \"the irony that I, a postmodern feminist, am being published because of my husband\\'s tenure here.\"\\n\\n\"Postmodern feminists represent a diverse group of people,\" the parody continued. \"Some of us are intellectuals. Many are politically committed. Most are disillusioned. Others are just plain horny. But there is one thing that we have in common: we have no sense of humor.\"\\n\\nAs the article began to circulate over the next few days, the adjectives flew. Andrea Brenneke, a third-year law student and one of many women to speak out, called the parody \"a perpetuation of the forces that killed Mary Joe Frug.\" In an open letter, nearly every member of the Harvard law faculty called it \"contemptible and cruel.\" As usual, Laurence H. Tribe and Alan Dershowitz weighed in with their observations. More criticism came -- to his many critics, belatedly and begrudgingly -- from Dean Robert C. Clark.\\n\\nThen came the apologies. The eight editors who oversaw the Revue called the takeoff \"tasteless\" and \"offensive.\" This group included David Ellen, the Review\\'s outgoing president, and Paul Clement, who will clerk one year hence for Justice Antonin Scalia at the United States Supreme Court. The two women among them filed a concurring mea culpa. Mr. Coben and Mr. Fenyo abjectly apologized as well, though they noted that none of their colleagues ever objected to what they wrote, at least until the whole school came down on them.\\n\\nMr. Coben, Mr. Fenyo and Mr. Ellen did not return a reporter\\'s phone calls. But in the fecund tradition of Harvard analyzing Harvard, others offered ample explanations for the debacle: the moral vacuousness of legal education; the sexist zeitgeist; the fractious political climate at Harvard; jangled gender politics in the era of Clarence Thomas, William Kennedy Smith and Mike Tyson; the peculiar combination of intelligence and isolation, sophistication and uncouthness, ignorance and arrogance that characterizes a few students at a few elite law schools.\\n\\nParticularly those students with clerkships in hand. Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg of the United States Court of Appeals in Washington, for whom Mr. Coben will work next year, did not return a phone call. But Mr. Fenyo\\'s future mentor, Judge J. Clifford Wallace of the Court of Appeals in San Diego, seemed disinclined to reconsider his offer in light of the parody. \"I haven\\'t seen it,\" he said. \"I haven\\'t heard anything about it. I\\'m really not even interested in it.\"',\n",

When we say “gymnastics,” we almost always mean “women’s gymnastics.” Though all the athletes who competed in gymnastics in the first modern Olympiad in Athens were men, the Platonic ideal of the gymnast has long been a woman (or rather, a girl).\\n\\nFrom Mary Lou Retton to Gabby Douglas, it’s women’s gymnastics that, every four years, captures the American imagination and whips up patriotic excitement. Men have more longevity in their branch of the sport, competing into their late 20s and mid-30s, whereas the women are often washed up by the time they can legally drink. (One notable exception is Oksana Chusovitina, who still competes for Uzbekistan at the geriatric-by-gymnastics-standards age of 41.)\\n\\nThe happy consequence is that gymnastics is one of the few sports where girls enjoy more prestige than grown men. In America, as Biles and her teammates are showing, they’re more likely to win gold and therefore achieve fame. They are also among that rare breed of female athletes who earn more from endorsements than the boys and men.\\n\\nMy coaches didn’t train boys, which meant that, apart from one or two male coaches, my training gym was a girl world. There, every surface wore a fine dusting of chalk, the dress code was leotard and bike shorts (matching scrunchie optional), and it was a given that girls were great athletes. In the gym, the strength of girls — our power, our resilience — was self-evident.\\n\\nFrom the age of 11, I was spending 21 hours a week in a place where girls, none of us older than 18, were indisputably athletic and where our abilities were never compared unfavorably to those of boys and men. By default, the sport was ours, and the gym felt like a refuge from a world that would always be someone else’s.\\n\\nFor some of us, at least. For others, the gym proved anything but a refuge from the predations of the world: Much later, I found out that one of our coaches, a man, had sexually abused several girls. USA Gymnastics, too, is now facing a reckoning after an investigation revealed that, for years, the governing body had ignored or suppressed allegations of sexual abuse.\\n\\nSpared of that, thankfully, I soon found my gymnastic metier. I was never much of a vaulter, and I lacked the explosive strength that makes a great tumbler. But high on the beam, which is barely four inches wide, I felt invincible.\\n\\nI relished the implausibility of contorting and catapulting my body in the air above this narrow little plank. I found joy in the exacting work of refining a muddled and terrified first attempt at a flip, doing it again and again until every finger and toe was in the right place and it wasn’t scary any more. And then a hundred more times, until the perfect version was committed to muscle memory.\\n\\nOf course, I wasn’t invincible. My dad’s hands shook on the camcorder for good reason. I was 8 or 9 the first time I took a nasty fall: I landed a leap wrong and fell with one leg on each side of the beam. The sandpapery covering, designed to make the beam easier to grip, scraped the skin off the insides of my legs before my pelvis slammed onto the apparatus.\\n\\nI slid off and toppled onto the mats, dazed, more in shock than in pain. A moment later, I climbed back up and did that leap again. My coach crouched down and looked me right in the eyes. “That,” she said, “is how I know you’re going to be a champion.”\\n\\nIt was the first hard fall of many, and if the gym was a reprieve from the world outside, it was also a rehearsal for it. Even before gymnastics did away with “the perfect 10” and replaced it with open-ended scoring, perfection was never truly possible. In gymnastics, as in life, we demand impossible perfection of girls, and punish them when they inevitably fail to achieve it.\\n\\nRecently, I took a drop-in gymnastics class in Manhattan. As I warmed up with the rest of the creaky-jointed adults, breathing in the old familiar smell of the foam mats, I watched the teenage girls finishing their practice session. Did we really used to do that? I asked myself. Was I ever that fearless?\\n\\nChloe S.

       "  'title': 'Lena Dunham and Feminism: Beware the Vitriol of the Sisterhood',\n",
       "  'date': '20160527142341',\n",
       "  'text': '“Sisterhood is powerful. It kills. Mostly sisters.”\\n\\nThose were the words of Ti-Grace Atkinson, an author and philosopher, when she resigned from the Feminists, a radical group she had founded in the late 1960s. They were repeated, forty years later, in the New Yorker\\u200b by Susan Faludi\\u200b, who \\u200bdescribed them as “one of the lines most frequently quoted by feminists.”\\n\\n\\u200bIf Lena Dunham’s latest lambasting is any indication, the words are still applicable today. The vitriol of the sisterhood is alive and well.\\n\\nThe latest controversy over Dunham goes like this: Last month, the 28-year-old creator of Girls published a memoir, Not That Kind of Girl. In the book, much in the same way her HBO series does, Dunham takes on all sorts of taboos, in revealing, unfiltered, at times uncomfortable sections on virginity, sisterly intimacy and platonic bed sharing, date rape, and more. She is graphic in her sexual descriptions, including a passage where she describes, as a 7-year-old, looking inside her younger sister’s vagina (to discover that her sister had placed pebbles in it, presumably as a prank).\\n\\nThe scene is cringe-inducing. It’s uncomfortable, no doubt. It’s also funny. I \\u200blaughed, \\u200bturned the page and kept reading. Little kids do bizarre things.\\n\\nI\\u200bt appeared that so did everybody else — until last week. That’s when an article in the National Review – written by Kevin Williamson, a man notable for an article on how “Laverne Cox Is Not a Woman” and seeming to suggest that women who get abortions should be hanged–– eviscerated Dunham for the chapter in her book about rape (he questioned why, if the story of an assault she suffered in college were truthful, she never “felt the need to press charges, file a complaint, or otherwise document the encounter.”) The right\\u200b-wing website TruthRevolt then picked up the \\u200bthread, \\u200bhomed in on the sisterly vagina scene \\u200b(along with a typo stating that Dunham was seventeen not 7) and declared in a headline (over which Dunham is now allegedly suing): “Lena Dunham describes sexually molesting her sister.”\\n\\nIn the version of things in my head, here’s how I would have expected this scenario to play out: \\u200b\\n\\nA few right wing publications and gossip blogs would pick up the story. \\u200bThe New York Post would write a \\u200bsnarky headline. \\u200bDunham would respond \\u200bon Twitter (which she did). Her sister, who is her best friend and tour manager, would chime in (which she did). Feminists would jump to her defense. What she did as a seven-year-old may bother people, but that’s precisely Dunham’s form of art. That doesn’t make it abuse.\\n\\nAnd yet\\u200b…\\u200b here is how it did play out. \\u200bDunham was swiftly called a “predator without remorse” — mostly by other feminists on Twitter.\\u200b She was compared to R. Kelly, Bill Cosby, and Jian Ghomeshi. She became the subject of a hashtag, #DropDunham, which called on Planned Parenthood – which has joined Dunham on a number of stops on her book tour – to disassociate from her immediately.\\n\\n\\u200bAnd on feminist listservs, Tumblr blogs and elsewhere, the pile-on began. She was “creepy.” “Not normal.” A “self-promoter.” “Full of herself.” A woman who needs to “sit the f–k down and learn something.” \\u200bShe was told to “get some boundaries.” To “stop being weird.” Her story was, as one blogger put it, “best kept in the confines of your family kitchen over Thanksgiving.”\\n\\nThis was not the National Review talking. These were fellow feminists.\\n\\nYes, she had defenders: Jimmy Kimmel tweeted that suggesting “a 7 yr-old girl is even capable of ‘molestation’ is vile\\u200b”; a sex researcher at the Kinsey Institute wrote that “it’s normal for kids to explore with each other;” prominent feminist voices like Roxane Gay (who called Dunham “gutsy” and “audacious” in a review of her book), Katha Pollitt (who donated to Planned Parenthood in Dunham’s honor); and a group of women who launched a Tumblr to curate all sorts of youthful (and at times unsettling) stories of sexual exploration. \\u200b(Dunham responded again, too, writing in TIME that she takes abuse seriously and noting that her sister had given permission for her to publish the story.)\\n\\nAnd yet the vitriol from her critics was so intense, so personal, so almost gleeful, that it was hard not to wonder if this was really about Lena Dunham at all.\\n\\n“Honestly, I don’t think I’ve even seen this level of outrage over Bill Cosby,” one friend commented, referring to the allegations of sexual abuse against Cosby.\\n\\nWhy, whenever there is a powerful woman speaking about feminism publicly (including, ahem: Sheryl Sandberg, and please see the disclosure in my bio) must they become so polarizing as to make feminism, as one journalist put it, “a bipartisan issue“?\\u200b (It’s worth noting that among my cohort, anyway, there has been far more discussion about Dunham than about the elections).\\n\\nFeminism is about giving women equal opportunity, equal voice, equal power. And yet, over and over again, when female voices attain that power, we – other women – parse and analyze their every move, public and personal, with an absurdly critical eye. We see it in politics, in pop culture, in film. From Hillary Clinton to Sandberg to Anne Hathaway. (As Roxane Gay put it in a piece for The Rumpus, “Young women in Hollywood cannot win, no matter what they do.”)\\n\\nTo be clear: There are plenty of people who think Dunham’s behavior toward her sister was questionable, and that’s a valid argument to have. (Though “inappropriate” is a whole lot different from “molestation” so say the experts.) There are others who’ve argued that acknowledging Dunham’s race, and privileged background, are crucial to this conversation. (I happen to disagree – but that too, is a discussion worth having.)\\n\\nBut this has become a witch hunt – and it has everything to do with\\u200b how we view women like Dunham.\\n\\nFeminism has a long history of what Ms. Magazine, in a 1976 piece by Jo Freeman, called “trashing.” That is, taking jabs at women who suddenly rise up, helping elevate them, but then tearing them down when they become too successful. “This standard,” Freeman wrote, “is clothed in the rhetoric of revolution and feminism. But underneath are some very traditional ideas about women’s proper roles.”\\n\\nDunham is a perfect target for trashing – because she doesn’t fit into our traditional molds. She is loud, out there, imperfect, messy, and some might say maybe even a little gross. She speaks openly about feminism, and sex, the ambiguity of consent, and she doesn’t apologize for it. She makes people uncomfortable. And while she may have risen up propelled by the support of other women, somewhere along the way, she lost her likability – as powerful women often do. She is just a little too loud, a little too unapologetic, a little too overtly sexual, a little … successful.\\n\\nBut that doesn’t make her a molester.\\n\\nDunham has always presented herself as flawed. She has never made herself a paragon, or claimed to represent us all. Yes, her character on Girls called herself a “voice of her generation.” She is also not her character (and has said repeatedly that it was just a line). And she’s not a politician, she’s an artist. It is her job is to push boundaries. To speak loudly. And, yes, to self-promote – and sell books.\\n\\nDunham’s accomplishments are what feminists should want women to aspire to: she is the writer, director and star, making art about women, from a woman’s point of view, in an industry that is still dominated by men. She doesn’t represent all women — and she shouldn’t have to. But she is willing to say what many other high-profile women won’t (at least not publicly). Yes, she has a voice that creates controversy. Yes, she makes people uncomfortable.\\n\\nBut why do we hold her to a seemingly higher standard? Why must her voice represent us all?\\n\\nNo one can be “everything to everybody,” Freeman wrote back in 1976. And neither can Lena Dunham. Like her, don’t like her. Watch Girls, don’t watch it. But let’s not forget: There is room for more women than Lena Dunham at the top.\\n\\nJessica Bennett is a contributing columnist at Time.com covering the intersection of gender, sexuality, business and pop culture.

       "  'text': \"POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y., June 18— Feminism, the cultural patterns that perpetuated male dominance, the irrelevance of much of the current women's movement to women in minority groups and the dangers of a return to the antifeminism of the 1920's and 30's were among the themes dominating the Fifth Berkshire Conference on the History of Women, which ended here today.\\n\\nThe three-day meeting, with 136 panels and workshops on women's history since medieval times, was sponsored by Vassar College and drew almost 1,500 historians, teachers, librarians, psychologists, sociologists and anthropologists from the United States, Canada and Europe.\\n\\nA warning that ''conservative forces have captured the power to fulfill our gloomiest predictions'' was voiced by Joan W. Scott, professor of history at Brown University, in her keynote address. She said the Surgeon General-designate, Dr. C. Everett Koop, was a foe of abortion, that the Attorney General's office was being staffed ''with assistants whose careers have been dedicated to the abolition of affirmative action'' and that ''the only high-ranking woman in the Administration gives no cause for celebration.''\\n\\n''Jeane Kirkpatrick is not someone I want to represent feminine accomplishment,'' she said, speaking of the chief delegate to the United Nations.\\n\\nCiting examples of women in academic fields, Professor Scott observed that although there was little reason for optimism about what had been gained in the 1970's, the situation today was even less hopeful.\\n\\n''The circumstances of the 1980's bring to mind the 1920's and 30's,'' she said. ''Then, after the triumph of winning the vote, women faced a well-organized antifeminist movement which struck at the cultural and political bases of female solidarity.''\\n\\nParticipants in a panel on ''The Subordinate Role'' agreed that women neither accepted nor rejected it, but rather created strategies of survival and liberation somewhere between subordination and rebellion. Bonnie S. Anderson of Brooklyn College, the chairman, pointed out, too, the panelists' unanimous belief that women attempting to emerge from traditional subordinate roles found cultural restraints even more burdensome than economic limitations.\\n\\nKathleen Stassen Berger reported that five studies of more than 600 high-achieving women had found that a supporting network was of more assistance than education and paid employment in helping women realize their potential.\\n\\nFathers who encouraged autonomous development were found to be more influential in their daughters' lives than were mothers. Elder siblings were important by their absence. A disproportionate number of the women surveyed were first-borns, and of those who had elder siblings, they were more likely to be elder sisters than big brothers.\\n\\n''I suspect that big brothers themselves slow down the independence of the little sister, as they denigrate her accomplishments and 'protect' her from the outside world,'' said Professor Berger, of Bronx Community College of the City University of New York. She mentioned, as well, the prevalence, in the lives of the women studied, of a relationship with a mentor, usually a man, and the lack of husbands and children.\\n\\nGerda Lerner, professor of history at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, was one of the star attractions at the most widely attended panel. More than 500 people heard the new president of the Organization of American Historians outline ''A General Theory of Women in History.''\\n\\nThe hour-long talk, a condensation of a book in progress, advanced the thesis that the oppression of women was the model for the invention of slavery.\\n\\n''The oppression of women antedates slavery and made it possible,'' she said. The difference in the aspirations of the women's movement, as it is perceived, and those of women in minority groups was outlined by Marquita L. James, Eleanor Smith and Shirlene Soto in a panel entitled ''Toward Sisterhood? Problems and Goals.''\\n\\n''The women's movement seems to be too white, too middle class, too much a reflection of the larger society. It embraces stererotypes about minority women too readily,'' said Professor Soto, who is in the history department at the California Polytechnic State University.\\n\\nShe said, ''To the chicana, it makes little difference if she is unemployed because she is a woman or because she is chicana.'' ''Black women believe they are oppressed not by black men but by white society,'' said Professor James, of Nassau Community College in Garden City, L.I. ''Black women are almost unanimous in their insistence that their own liberation depends on the liberation of their race and the improvements of the life of the black community. White feminists must immediately begin to recognize that black women are foremost victims of oppression in this country because of their color, not their sex.''\\n\\nProfessor Smith of the University of Cincinnati offered suggestions to further mutual respect and reciprocal support. White women should examine their roles in contributing to a racist society, she said, black women should take greater strides against allowing others to speak for them and nonwhite women should ''cease trying to be white and become politically conscious of their plight as a minority and accept themselves historically and culturally.''\\n\\nFeminist perspectives on women's higher education were discussed by Florence Howe of the State University of New York, Old Westbury, L.I.; Elizabeth A. Daniels and Barbara J. Page of Vassar, Laurel Furumoto of Wellesley and Grace Haddad of Lake Erie College in Painsville, Ohio.\\n\\nOutlining conclusions based on studies of Stanford and Wellesley, Professor Howe said that higher education still resides in a universe in which maleness and femaleness are ranked, and in which women's colleges continue to be seen as not mainstream, without the power to effect change.\\n\\nSandi Cooper, president of the conference, was chairman of ''Government Surveillance and the Control of Women,'' one of the most discussed panels of the conference. Among the participants were Blanche Wiesen Cook of John Jay College, who spoke on ''The Repression and Resistance of Women in America, from the F.B.I. to the Moral Majority,'' and Amy Swerdlow of Sarah Lawrence College, who discussed the 1962 confrontation between the Women's Strike for Peace and the House Committee on Un-American Activities. Bettina Aptheker of the University of California at Santa Cruz told of her own experiences of surveillance, imprisonment, beatings and rape as a political activist during the 1960's.\\n\\nOther panels included papers by Elizabeth Pleck of the Wellesley College Center for Research on Women, on how life in the United States challenged the patriarchal authority of the Old World family, and by Diana Grossman Kahn, a clinical psychologist at the Bunting Insitute, Radcliffe College, who raised the possibility that some women's aspirations were related to their mother's lost ambitions.\\n\\nIllustrations: photo of Joan Scott photo of Sandi Cooper and Gerda Lerner\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Militant. Radical. Man-hating. If you study word patterns in media over the past two decades, you’ll find that these are among the most common terms used to talk about the word “feminist.” Yes, I did this — with the help of a linguist and a tool called the Corpus of Contemporary American English, which is the world’s largest database of language.\\n\\nI did a similar search on Twitter, with the help of Twitter’s data team, looking at language trends over the past 48 hours. There, the word patterns were more simple. Search “feminist,” and you’ll likely come up with just one word association: Beyoncé.\\n\\nThat’s a product of Sunday’s MTV Video Music Awards, of course, in which the 33-year-old closed out the show with an epic declaration of the F-Word, a giant “FEMINIST” sign blazing from behind her silhouette.\\n\\nAs far as feminist endorsements are concerned, this was the holy grail: A word with a complicated history reclaimed by the most powerful celebrity in the world. And then she projected it — along with its definition, by the Nigerian feminist author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie — into the homes of 12 million unassuming Americans. Beyoncé would become the subject of two-thirds of all tweets about feminism in the 24 hours after her appearance, according to a data analysis by Twitter, making Sunday the sixth-highest day for volume of conversation about feminism since Twitter began tracking this year (the top three were days during #YesAllWomen).\\n\\n“What Bey just did for feminism, on national television, look, for better or worse, that reach is WAY more than anything we’ve seen,” the writer Roxane Gay, author of the new book, Bad Feminist, declared (on Twitter, naturally).\\n\\n“HELL YES!” messaged Jennifer Pozner, a writer and media critic.\\n\\n“It would have been unthinkable during my era,” said Barbara Berg, a historian and the author of Sexism in America.\\n\\nFeminism may be enjoying a particular celebrity moment, but let’s just remember that this wasn’t always the case. Feminism’s definition may be simple — it is the social, political and economic equality of the sexes, as Adichie put it — and yet its interpretation is anything but. “There was only about two seconds in the history of the world in which women really welcomed [feminism],” Gail Collins, The New York Times columnist and author of America’s Women once told me in 2010, for an article I was writing about young women and feminism. “There’s something about the word that just drives people nuts.”\\n\\nOver the past 40 years in particular, as Berg explains it, the word has seen it all: exultation, neutrality, uncertainty, animosity. “Feminazi” has become a perennial (and favorite) insult of the religious right (and of Rush Limbaugh). In 1992, in a public letter decrying a proposal for an equal rights amendment (the horror!) television evangelist Pat Robertson hilariously proclaimed that feminism would cause women to “leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians.”\\n\\nEven the leaders of the movement have debated whether the word should be abandoned (or rebranded). From feminist has evolved the words womanist, humanist, and a host of other options — including, at one point, the suggestion from Queen Bey herself for something a little bit more catchy, “like ‘bootylicious.'” (Thank God that didn’t stick.)\\n\\nIt wasn’t that the people behind these efforts (well, most of them anyway) didn’t believe in the tenets of feminism — to the contrary, they did. But there was just something about identifying with that word. For some, it was pure naiveté: We were raised post-Title IX, and there were moments here and there where we thought maybe we didn’t need it. (We could be whatever we wanted, right? That was the gift of the feminists who came before us.) But for others, it was a notion of what the word had come to represent: angry, extreme, unlikeable. As recently as last year, a poll by the Huffington Post/YouGov found that while 82 percent of Americans stated that they indeed believe women and men should be equals, only 20 percent of them were willing to identify as feminists.\\n\\nEnter… Beyoncé. The new enlightened Beyoncé, that is. Universally loved, virtually unquestioned, and flawless, the 33-year-old entertainer seems to debunk every feminist stereotype you’ve ever heard. Beyoncé can’t be a man-hater – she’s got a man (right?). Her relationship – whatever you believe about the divorce rumors – has been elevated as a kind of model for egalitarian bliss: dual earners, adventurous sex life, supportive husband and an adorable child held up on stage by daddy while mommy worked. Beyoncé’s got the confidence of a superstar but the feminine touch of a mother. And, as a woman of color, she’s speaking to the masses – a powerful voice amid a movement that has a complicated history when it comes to inclusion.\\n\\nNo, you don’t have to like the way Beyoncé writhes around in that leotard – or the slickness with which her image is controlled – but whether you like it or not, she’s accomplished what feminists have long struggled to do: She’s reached the masses. She has, literally, brought feminism into the living rooms of 12.4 million Americans. “Sure, it’s just the VMAs,” says Pozner. “She’s not marching in Ferguson or staffing a battered woman’s shelter, but through her performance millions of mainstream music fans are being challenged to think about feminism as something powerful, important, and yes, attractive. And let’s head off at the pass any of the usual hand-wringing about her sexuality — Madonna never put the word FEMINIST in glowing lights during a national awards show performance. This is, as we say… a major moment.”\\n\\nIt’s what’s behind the word that matters, of course. Empty branding won’t change policy (and, yes, we need policy change). But there is power in language, too.\\n\\n“Looking back on those early days of feminism, you can see that the word worked as a rallying cry,” says Deborah Tannen, aa linguist at Georgetown University and the author of You Just Don’t Understand, about men and women in conversation. “It gave women who embraced [it] a sense of identity and community — a feeling that they were part of something, and a connection to others who were a part of it too. Beyoncé’s taking back this word and identifying with it is huge.”\\n\\nBennett is a contributing columnist at TIME.com covering the intersection of gender, sexuality, business and pop culture.

       "  'text': 'HILLARY CLINTON’S securing of the Democratic nomination doesn’t just put a woman in range of the White House; it puts a mother there. And that’s momentous. Over the past half-century, unmarried childless women have overcome every barrier to opportunity you can think of, and now earn 96 percent of what men do. Mothers, on the other hand, aren’t doing nearly as well: Married mothers are paid 76 cents on the dollar.\\n\\nTo me, Mrs. Clinton’s sheer professional survival is as inspiring as any of her other accomplishments. A woman with a small child can easily lose faith that she’ll ever do anything else again. God knows I did. For the first five years of my child-rearing life, I was supposed to be writing a book, but mostly I dodged my editor’s calls. The 3-year-old had separation anxiety, so I waited it out on one of the nursery school’s kid-size chairs. I lacked the heart to say no to play dates, so I shut my computer and attended to juice boxes.\\n\\nThen there was Ladies’ Night, when the mothers on my cul-de-sac got together to drink too much wine. Fun, sure, but really: “Ladies’ Night”? The fact that I went every week proved that my professional viability was fast disappearing, or so I thought at the time.\\n\\nHow did Mrs. Clinton hold on to hers? How did she rebound from the years in which she was raising a daughter, pursuing a law career and serving as first lady of Arkansas? She has a steely will, as everyone knows. But another answer is that it was in many ways easier to be a working mother in 1980, when Chelsea Clinton was born, than it is today.\\n\\nBetween the ’80s and the aughts, when I had my children, a cloud of economic anxiety descended on parents, tightening what the sociologist Arlie Hochschild has called “the time bind.” The workweek of salaried professionals ballooned from 40 hours to 50 hours or more, not counting the email catch-up done after the kids’ bedtime. Union protections, predictable schedules and benefits vanished for vast numbers of blue-collar workers. Their jobs in the service or on-demand economies now pay so little, and child care costs so much (168 percent more than it did a quarter-century ago) that parents have to stitch together multiple jobs. Meanwhile, terrified that their offspring will sink even lower, parents siphon off time and money to hand-raise children who can compete in a global economy.\\n\\nWomen like me who scale back in the face of impossible expectations feel themselves morphing into caricatures: attachment freaks, helicopter moms, concerted cultivators, neo-traditionalists. These stereotypes are just plain sexist, but I don’t know many mothers whose careers, paychecks and sense of self-worth haven’t been eroded by all the compromises they’ve had to make. Our worlds have narrowed; our bank accounts have dipped below the minimum balance; and our power within the family and the world has dwindled. We’d be quick to tell you that we wouldn’t have done it any differently. Still.\\n\\nWhat if the world was set up in such a way that we could really believe — not just pretend to — that having spent a period of time concentrating on raising children at the expense of future earnings would bring us respect? And what if that could be as true for men as it is for women?\\n\\nWe live in an age rich in feminisms. One celebrates our multiplicity of identities: black, lesbian, transgender. Another has effectively anathematized sexual violence. Yet another — I think of it as C-suite feminism — chips away at the glass ceiling that keeps women out of the most powerful jobs, such as, say, the presidency.\\n\\nBut we need another feminism — and it needs a name that has nothing to do with gender. Let’s call it, for lack of a better term, “caregiverism.” It would demand dignity and economic justice for parents dissatisfied with a few weeks of unpaid parental leave, and strive to mitigate the sacrifices made by adult children responsible for aging parents.\\n\\nMrs. Clinton could be a champion of caregiverism. She has been blunter this electoral season about family-friendly policies than she has ever been before. She emphasized paid family leave when she began her campaign and again in the opening statements of the first Democratic presidential debate. In May, she said she’d cap the cost of child care at 10 percent of a household’s income, down from what, for a household supported by minimum-wage workers, can now be more than 30 percent.\\n\\nBut she needs to go further. Her focus is on wage-earners; what about the people who want to get out of the workplace, at least for a while? Mrs. Clinton should talk to Representative Nita Lowey of New York, who last year introduced a bill that would give Social Security credits to caregivers who left the labor market or cut back on hours — a public nod to the reality that care is work and caregivers merit the same benefits as other workers.\\n\\nMrs. Clinton belongs to an earlier generation, one whose objective was to free women from the prison of domesticity — at least the middle-class women who didn’t already have jobs — and send them marching into the work force to demand equality there. But true equality will take more than equal pay and better working conditions. It will require something more radical, a “transvaluation of all values,” in Nietzsche’s phrase.\\n\\nAm I calling for a counterrevolution? I don’t think so. Feminists have not always seen work as the answer to women’s problems. Many who put in sweatshop hours in the textile industry or open-ended days in domestic service fought for the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which established the 40-hour workweek. Working women “were not just organizable; they were the best constituency for struggle over the working day,” write David Roediger and Philip Foner in “Our Own Time: A History of American Labor and the Working Day.”\\n\\nThere is also a venerable tradition in feminist history of trying to overturn a status quo that esteems professionals and wage-earners while demeaning those who do the unpaid or low-paid work of emotional sustenance and physical upkeep. In the 1960s, the largely African-American National Welfare Rights Organization demanded welfare payments that would maintain a decent standard of living, partly on the grounds that these mothers were working already, raising future workers, and partly because they couldn’t find jobs that would support them. “I am 45 years old; I have raised six children,” wrote the group’s chairwoman, Johnnie Tillmon, in 1972. “A job doesn’t necessarily mean an adequate income. There are some 10 million jobs that now pay less than the minimum wage, and if you’re a woman, you’ve got the best chance of getting one.”\\n\\nAround the same time, the Marxist feminists Mariarosa Dalla Costa and Selma James began a campaign called Wages for Housework that called for the overthrow of a capitalist order subsidized, in their view, by the unpaid slog of homemaking and, yes, sexual services. This did not mean that women should necessarily go out and find jobs. “Not one of us believes that emancipation, liberation, can be achieved through work,” they wrote. “Slavery to an assembly line is not liberation from slavery to a kitchen sink.”\\n\\nLiberal feminists accused them of wanting to push women back into domestic drudgery, but they denied it. “We have worked enough,” they wrote. “We have chopped billions of tons of cotton, washed billions of dishes, scrubbed billions of floors, typed billions of words, wired billions of radio sets, washed billions of nappies, by hand and in machines.” So what did they want? I asked Silvia Federici, a founder of the New York chapter of Wages for Housework who writes prolifically on these questions. Actual wages for housework aside, she said, the movement wanted to make people ask themselves, “Why is producing cars more valuable than producing children?”\\n\\nThe expectation that all mothers will work has been especially hard on single mothers. When Franklin D. Roosevelt established the welfare program Aid to Dependent Children in 1935 it was a given that poor single mothers would tend to their young (poor single white mothers, I should say, because black women were expected to hold jobs). By the 1970s, that presumption having vanished, Ronald Reagan could argue that welfare mothers were “lazy parasites” and “pigs at the trough,” laying the groundwork for welfare reform.\\n\\nThe program put in place by Bill Clinton in 1996, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, cuts off benefits after five years or less; forces women to hold or look for jobs, whether or not there are any to be had; and allows states to shunt welfare funds into other programs. And so, from 1996 to 2011, the number of families living in extreme poverty — on $2 per person a day or less — more than doubled. A majority of those households were headed by single mothers.',\n",

       "  'date': '20160527123510',\n",
       "  'text': 'At the time, the ad campaign — modeled on efforts to curb drunk driving — was considered shocking. It was 1994, the year that OJ Simpson would be arrested for murder, his history of domestic abuse exposed. Yet even so, domestic violence was not a crime that anybody seemed willing to talk about back then. It was, as then Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala put it, “our dirty little secret” — something that happened, and stayed, behind closed doors.\\n\\nBut Esta Soler, the president of a group called Futures Without Violence, was determined to get people talking. Under the banner, “There’s No Excuse for Domestic Violence,” she distributed a series of advertisements to 22,000 media outlets — including ones published in TIME and People. In one, the blurred image of a woman is pictured cowering under a man. “If we remain silent,” Soler told the Washington Post at the time, “our silence will breed even more fear.”\\n\\nTwenty years later, domestic abuse is again making headlines (and again with a star football player). But this time women are talking about it en masse.\\n\\nWhen TMZ released a damning video of Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice beating his girlfriend (now wife) unconscious on Monday, the response was swift: commenters called the NFL response an “epic breach of trust.” Rice was cut from the team. Cable news commenters began to question, in light of the revelation, why Rice’s wife would have stayed with him in the first place.\\n\\nBeverly Gooden, a Cleveland HR manager, had had enough. Under the hashtag #WhyIStayed, she tweeted a staccato response:\\n\\n“I stayed because my pastor told me that God hates divorce,” she wrote of her own abusive relationship.\\n\\n“I stayed because I was halfway across the country, isolated from my friends and family.”\\n\\n“I stayed because I thought love was enough to conquer all.”\\n\\nIt was the antidote to the simplistic view of many of the “experts” who’d weighed in, and it went viral in an instant. “You can feel voiceless,” Gooden told PolicyMic, as the hashtag collected thousands of women’s (and men’s) stories. “I want people to know that they have a voice.”\\n\\nShe was talking about domestic violence, and yet it could have been a metaphor for the way that women like her are using social media daily to make their voices heard. From #StandWithWendy to #HobbyLobby to #YesAllWomen, they are bypassing the gatekeepers, simply by sheer mass — forcing attention on the issues they deem important. “This conversation would have been impossible even 10 years ago,” says Soler, reflecting on more than 30 years as an advocate. “Social media has created space for people of all kinds to express themselves, and to see their voices amplified.”\\n\\nThe women’s social media revolution began some time ago — but reached its tipping point this year. In May, #YesAllWomen practically broke the Internet — a response to the misogynist killings at UCSB that turned into a three day global movement. Since then, the stream of hashtag causes has been hard to keep up with: #SurvivorPrivilege, the response to a George Will column that asserted being a rape survivor on a college campus was now a “coveted status” (he was dumped by the St. Louis Dispatch as a result). There’s #EverydaySexism, about daily harassment, #YouOKSis, to challenge street harassment, #AskHerMore, which calls out the questions we wish reporters would ask women on the red carpet. The list goes on. It’s no huge surprise that, according to data from Twitter, conversation about “feminism” has increased by 300 percent on the platform over the past three years. Women’s issues are everywhere, relentlessly spread by the women they impact. For the mainstream media, tracking the feminist hashtag of the moment has become a virtual sport.\\n\\nIn the 1970s, feminists often said “the personal is political.” It meant that the more women could connect with issues in their own life, the more attention they’d pay to the politics around them. But if consciousness-raising groups were the personal for thousands of women then, then the intimate personal stories curated in hashtags like #WhyIStayed are the modern-day equivalent. “What I think is most unique now is that we’re able to attach our own stories to elevate the issues beyond just a video of a man punching a woman,” says Tara Conley, an ethnographer who studies online media and the creator of a blog called Hashtag Feminism. “Social media can play an important role in opening up spaces for women — particularly those who’ve been marginalized.”\\n\\nSocial organizing has always existed in the women’s space — from word of mouth to letter-writing to telephone chains and flyers, methods of organizing has adopted to the times. And yet in a pre-Internet era, unless a woman accidentally stumbled into a protest, or a consciousness-raising group, she likely wasn’t hearing much about it. Which is why #WhyIStayed, and movements like it, are even more significant. They manage to take issues frequently confined to small circles — feminist circles — and bring them to the masses. “What is interesting to me is how these issues are going mainstream,” says Matthew Slutsky, who runs partnerships at Change.org. “It’s not feminists, or even activists, talking about rape, or domestic violence, or abortion rights, anymore. It’s just people.”\\n\\nThose people happen to be women — mostly. Which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Women’s power on the internet continues to rise: they now dominate every major social media platform but one (LinkedIn), they log in more often than their male counterparts, and they are more engaged when they do. When it comes to activism, they are ruling there, too: women are 2.5 times more likely to sign petitions than their male counterparts, and more likely to have successful organizing campaigns, according to data from Change.org. “Women don’t just dominate social media, they drive traffic,” says Elizabeth Plank, the executive social editor at PolicyMic. “That’s a massive game changer.”\\n\\nIt means that they don’t just have a voice, they are forcing institutions to listen.\\n\\nBennett is a contributing columnist at Time.com covering the intersection of gender, sexuality, business and pop culture.

       "  'text': 'The feminist who inspired Beyoncé may have just provided the perfect argument against the singer’s haters. Nigerian author and MacArthur fellow Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, who’s most recent book Americanah just won a National Book Critics Circle award, spoke to NPR’s Michele Martin in a wide-ranging interview that touched on the nuances of feminism in the West, Nigeria’s anti-gay laws and her love of fashion.\\n\\nBut the most fascinating part of the interview comes when Martin asks the author’s opinion of Beyoncé, who famously sampled Adichie’s viral TED talk “We Should All Be Feminists” in her song “***Flawless.” Martin points out that the singer is often criticized for celebrating her sexuality while calling herself a feminist at the same time. Adichie provides a pitch perfect response that’s exceptional not only because it’s void of the usual celebrity gushing, but still perfectly reasoned.\\n\\nI think that anything that gets young people talking about feminism is a very good thing. I also think that I have a problem with the idea of feminism as being some sort of exclusive party that someone gets to decide whether you can come, and also the idea that somehow a woman who is comfortable with her sexuality, that there’s something wrong with that.\\n\\nThe accomplished Adichie declines to confirm whether new “It” girl Lupita Nyong’o will star in the movie adaptation of Americanah, but reveals that the actress “is probably going to option” the book.

       "  'text': 'This story contains spoilers for the final episode of The Good Wife.\\n\\nThe Good Wife slapped us in the face — literally. While many shows offer resolution in their final episodes, The Good Wife emphatically refused to do so. It brought back the ghost of Will Gardner not to provide closure or offer guidance as most benevolent ghosts would, but to steer Alicia into making choices that could get her hurt. The writers undercut everything we expected: a romantic resolution, a resolution to her partnership with Diane Lockhart, a resolution as to Peter’s guilt, and all in the most jarring way possible. It was a bold move and a fitting end to a show that completely revolutionized what a network drama can do.\\n\\nThat’s not to say that the finale lived up to some of the show’s best episodes. The Good Wife had undeniably run its course. Last week Lucca and Jason chatted about Alicia over drinks in a sequence that felt as if it had been scripted for the lawyer’s former sidekick and love interest, Kalinda and Will, three years ago. The show was repeating old drama with less interesting characters. As bitter as I am at Josh Charles and Archie Panjabi for jumping ship, they seem to have done so at the right time.\\n\\nIndeed, the whole plot has come full circle: the show opened with the question of whether Peter would go to jail, and if Alicia would stick by him. Tonight, with Peter again facing conviction and divorce, we finally got our answer: yes and no. She’ll stand next to him for the optics, but won’t hold his hand at the podium. Whether that’s a character growing stronger or growing into a more cynical political operative, I will leave to you to decide.\\n\\nBut let us not bemoan the decline of The Good Wife — it’s a rare television show that ends with its strongest season — but celebrate what it did give us.\\n\\nThe Good Wife gave us a revolutionary take on modern feminism. One of television’s few complicated heroines, the writers also let her grow and, more importantly, contradict herself without apologizing or explaining her actions. The show made us both love and hate Alicia, while other television writers fretted over their heroines being “likable.” The finale proved to be a clear embodiment of this idea as Alicia decides she wants to be with Jason, whom she describes as “a boy,” just because she doesn’t want to live in her apartment alone. It’s apt, then, that this wish isn’t fulfilled. Not only that, but when the audience thinks the resolution might be that Diane and Alicia were in fact meant to be (a girl-power conclusion), Diane, the embodiment of relentless feminism on the show, slaps Alicia in the face in the final moments (paralleling Alicia’s empowering slap of Peter in the first episode).\\n\\nZack’s new fiancé (another new actor in a familiar role for the show) comes out and says it in the third-to-last episode: some might think Alicia sticking by her man is retro, but feminism means women can do whatever they want — even if that means playing the saint.\\n\\nOf course, what this character doesn’t know is that “St. Alicia,” over the course of seven seasons, has slowly learned that she doesn’t have to be, well, the good wife. Her affair with Will was tentative, fraught and full of complications. Not so for her relationship with Jason. She doesn’t care what people think and is even willing to make out with her investigator boyfriend in a bar. (A whole other piece could be written about the frank depiction of sexuality on the show: it’s rare for Hollywood to offer us a woman over 40 who is allowed to enjoy sex, let alone receive oral pleasure.)\\n\\nIn Season 1, we saw a lot more of Grace and Zack as Alicia tried to balance work and home and struggled with “bad mother” guilt. By Season 7, she’s employed Grace to help her with her career goals and accepted that Zack’s quick marriage as his mistake to make.\\n\\nShe’s shaken by Peter’s transgressions in the beginning, but by the penultimate episode she responds to Peter’s latest affair by mock crying and rolling her eyes. She’s gotten tougher, accepted her flaws, gone after her goals. She’s not the feminist hero we deserve — as we see with the slap — but she’s definitely evolved. That is a woman doing what she wants. Though Julianna Margulies has emphatically denied the comparison, the Hillary Clinton parallel is undeniable: think of the presidential candidate in the days of the Monica Lewinsky scandal compared to today.\\n\\nThe Good Wife gave us surprisingly nuanced debates around hot-button issues like abortion, gun control, gay marriage, government surveillance, campus rape and the tech bubble. (Oh, ChumHum, you will be missed.) Even as the country was becoming more politically polarized, Emily’s List darling Diane has productive conversations with her Sarah Palin–worshipping husband about the right to bear arms or with a right-wing businessman about whether a devout Christian baker can legally refuse to create a wedding cake for a gay couple. Though the main characters were Democrats, the show never assumed they were right.\\n\\nAnd The Good Wife gave us a well-made drama every Sunday night for 22 weeks a year. Besides offering one of the greatest Hollywood romances — no, I’m not talking about Peter or Jason but the ghost that joined us in the finale — it was arguably the only remaining prestige drama on network television. It was the last show from one of the major networks to be nominated for a best drama Emmy in 2011. (It never won.) Ever since, cable dramas like Mad Men, British imports like Downton Abbey and streaming-service darlings like Netflix’s House of Cards have dominated the category.\\n\\nThe Emmys are by no means the definitive judge of quality television: fans of Scandal and Grey’s Anatomy would argue that Shonda Rhimes is writing great drama on ABC. But those shows rely on “OMG moments” every single episode that The Good Wife and other “prestige television shows,” from The Sopranos to Breaking Bad, sprung on their audiences once a season. The closest The Good Wife ever came to a must-tweet scene was Will’s shocking death (and tonight’s ghostly return), a moment that worked precisely because it was so out of character for the show.\\n\\nIt’s the end of an era. Both Charles and Margulies have vowed never to act in a 22-episode-per-year drama again: they require 14-hour workdays year-round. For better or worse, these sorts of shows have been cut down to eight- or 12-episode seasons and sold to cable networks, streaming services or HBO. Network television, meanwhile, seems content with procedurals like CSI or replicating the Shondaland model with shows like Empire and Quantico. It’s similar to what’s happened in film, where most studios lean heavily on superhero blockbusters and leave the quieter fare to indie filmmakers who must seek out smaller distributors. Luckily for television fans, AMC, Netflix and the like seem willing to take risks on this sort of fare — at least for now.\\n\\nAfter the soon-to-be-infamous slap, Alicia composes herself and struts forward. May all our future television heroes and heroines exhibit such chutzpah.',\n",

       "  'text': 'I am alternately disgusted and saddened that women continue to be valued for their beauty and their reproductive capabilities over their accomplishments. I fully support Patricia Arquette’s dutiful writing out of her acceptance speech for Best Actress in a Supporting Role so that she could thank everyone and fit in a call for gender equality, even if she got some legitimate criticism for it. Yet, despite my ardent support for feminism, I found that the #AskHerMore campaign, which advocates that reporters talk to actresses about what’s inside their minds rather than what they’re wearing, and which was begun by Amy Poehler—and re-ignited for Oscars 2015 by Reese Witherspoon—to be eye-rollingly annoying. It is yet another offering from a brand of feminism that includes things like the Dove Real Beauty Campaign and lowers the movement into something cheap and silly, and suggests that a simplified, liberal critique around the importance of female beauty can have an effect on real, systemic oppression.\\n\\nFirst, I found it painful watching the red carpet reporters tie themselves up in knots to not ask beautiful women in beautiful dresses anything about being beautiful women in beautiful dresses. Robin Roberts, talking to The Theory of Everything’s Felicity Jones, mentioned upwards of 70 times how great it was that Jones was at the Oscar’s with her family. Then she asked Jones about the film’s subjects, Stephen Hawking and his ex-wife, and Jones said something about both of them being alive and how therefore the actors “brought everything they had to it,” which led you to wonder, if Hawking and his ex-wife were dead, would the actors have all slacked off? Mostly, it made you wish that this awkward moment would be saved by, oh, I don’t know, a question that was actually relevant like: “So you wore Alexander McQueen tonight when you’ve worn Dior this whole awards season—why?”\\n\\nAnd then there was Naomi Watts standing there in a controversial and great Armani gown with Ryan Seacrest asking her, horribly, about frittatas — which people got upset about, reasonably — oh if we can’t talk to a woman about what she looks like, let’s talk about cooking. But people. We’re talking about Ryan Seacrest here. Suddenly told he can’t discuss the elephant in the room, what can we really expect from him? You can’t be the nation that puts Ryan Seacrest in charge of things and then suddenly demand that he become Christiane Amanpour.\\n\\nAnd then there were the moments where #askhermore “worked.” Julianne Moore — resplendent in a dress Karl Lagerfeld made himself — informed us that Alzheimer’s is actually a disease and not just something you get when you’re old. Upworthy tweeted this as a meme with Moore’s photo, a quote and #askhermore. Yes, Alzheimer’s is a disease that needs more visibility, and yes, I applaud Moore, an intelligent, successful actress, for taking up the cause. But, I also just wanted someone to ask her regular dumb stuff. Like what you were wearing when Karl told you he’d make you the dress? Did you guys drink Coke Zero together? Did you meet Choupette?\\n\\nRobin Roberts introduced the subject with Witherspoon by abruptly shouting “askhermore!” with such jubilation, it was as if Reese had just discovered how to perform cold fusion instead of promoted a hashtag to convince reporters not to ask people about their fashion at what is basically a fashion show. “This is a movement to say we’re more than just our dresses. This is a group of women — 44 nominees this year are women — and we’re so happy to be here and talk about the work that we’ve done,” Witherspoon said. Well, I like Reese Witherspoon and I have without interruption ever since I saw her in Freeway. But, sue me, I’d rather hear her talk about Tom Ford on the red carpet — even about his sunglass collection — than to hear more about her role in Wild.\\n\\nYou’d have to be a complete moron to think that Hollywood isn’t sexist. It is desperately in need of an overhaul, both to improve the quality of its output and to increase opportunities for the non-male and non-white artists who might bring this to fruition. I realize that men are asked about their work more on the red carpet than women, but the truth it, it’s just a night of stupid questions, and I’m not sure why awards ceremonies are the place where women need to showcase their intelligence and interests. It seems like a positive thing — what kind of animal doesn’t care what women think? Not I! But I also think it plays into a sort of weird notion, that women never get to stop working, that they always have to set some kind of perfect example, “Oh, we’re not just beautiful, we’re also smart, we also care.” #AskHerMore seems to me to be the celebrity version of having it all — another manifestation of the pressure on women to be everything at all times. Women created this movement, and many seem to be empowered by it, but I wouldn’t be surprised if others wanted to just talk fashion.\\n\\nAlso, this night is really not just about the actors, it is about the thousands of people who have labored to get them there looking as great they do. And this is their night to get recognized, and to get their names spoken, and a lot of them didn’t, because we had to hear hacky questions about movies and frittatas and “how does it feel to be here?” and watch Lara Spencer rub Patricia Arquette’s shoulder, uninvited, instead of hearing hacky questions about clothes.\\n\\nI don’t mean to make light of women wanting to be taken seriously in Hollywood. I think it was very serious when Charlize Theron got a $10 million raise in the wake of the Sony hack. I think Arquette’s concerns were serious, even if she did not express them perfectly, and I think it’s extremely serious and a crime that most directors are men, and that they are regularly paid handsomely to make movies that most women would be laughed at for even proposing. But, I feel like demanding to be asked more thoughtful, probing questions by not terribly serious journalists on the night of an awards show when people want to know what you’re wearing like they want to know who did it at the end of a whodunnit is maybe not such a great use of time, energy… or even a hashtag.\\n\\nRead next: Sorry, Haters: America Loved Lady Gaga at the Oscars\\n\\nListen to the most important stories of the day.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Today we are launching a campaign called “HeForShe.” I am reaching out to you because I need your help. We want to end gender inequality—and to do that we need everyone to be involved.\\n\\nThis is the first campaign of its kind at the UN: we want to try and galvanize as many men and boys as possible to be advocates for gender equality. And we don’t just want to talk about it, but make sure it is tangible.\\n\\nI was appointed six months ago and the more I have spoken about feminism the more I have realized that fighting for women’s rights has too often become synonymous with man-hating. If there is one thing I know for certain, it is that this has to stop. For the record, feminism by definition is: “The belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities. It is the theory of the political, economic and social equality of the sexes.”\\n\\nI started questioning gender-based assumptions when at eight I was confused at being called “bossy,” because I wanted to direct the plays we would put on for our parents—but the boys were not.\\n\\nWhen at 14 I started being sexualized by certain elements of the press.\\n\\nWhen at 15 my girlfriends started dropping out of their sports teams because they didn’t want to appear “muscly.”\\n\\nWhen at 18 my male friends were unable to express their feelings.\\n\\nI decided I was a feminist and this seemed uncomplicated to me. But my recent research has shown me that feminism has become an unpopular word. Apparently I am among the ranks of women whose expressions are seen as too strong, too aggressive, isolating, anti-men and, unattractive.\\n\\nWhy is the word such an uncomfortable one?\\n\\nI am from Britain and think it is right that as a woman I am paid the same as my male counterparts. I think it is right that I should be able to make decisions about my own body. I think it is right that women be involved on my behalf in the policies and decision-making of my country. I think it is right that socially I am afforded the same respect as men. But sadly I can say that there is no one country in the world where all women can expect to receive these rights.\\n\\nNo country in the world can yet say they have achieved gender equality. These rights I consider to be human rights but I am one of the lucky ones. My life is a sheer privilege because my parents didn’t love me less because I was born a daughter. My school did not limit me because I was a girl. My mentors didn’t assume I would go less far because I might give birth to a child one day. These influencers were the gender equality ambassadors that made who I am today. They may not know it, but they are the inadvertent feminists who are. And we need more of those. And if you still hate the word—it is not the word that is important but the idea and the ambition behind it. Because not all women have been afforded the same rights that I have. In fact, statistically, very few have been.\\n\\nIn 1997, Hilary Clinton made a famous speech in Beijing about women’s rights. Sadly many of the things she wanted to change are still a reality today. But what stood out for me the most was that only 30 per cent of her audience were male. How can we affect change in the world when only half of it is invited or feel welcome to participate in the conversation?\\n\\nMen—I would like to take this opportunity to extend your formal invitation. Gender equality is your issue too.\\n\\nBecause to date, I’ve seen my father’s role as a parent being valued less by society despite my needing his presence as a child as much as my mother’s.\\n\\nI’ve seen young men suffering from mental illness unable to ask for help for fear it would make them look less “macho”—in fact in the UK suicide is the biggest killer of men between 20-49; eclipsing road accidents, cancer and coronary heart disease. I’ve seen men made fragile and insecure by a distorted sense of what constitutes male success. Men don’t have the benefits of equality either.\\n\\nWe don’t often talk about men being imprisoned by gender stereotypes but I can see that that they are and that when they are free, things will change for women as a natural consequence.\\n\\nIf men don’t have to be aggressive in order to be accepted women won’t feel compelled to be submissive. If men don’t have to control, women won’t have to be controlled.\\n\\nBoth men and women should feel free to be sensitive. Both men and women should feel free to be strong… It is time that we all perceive gender on a spectrum not as two opposing sets of ideals.\\n\\nIf we stop defining each other by what we are not and start defining ourselves by what we are—we can all be freer and this is what HeForShe is about. It’s about freedom. I want men to take up this mantle. So their daughters, sisters and mothers can be free from prejudice but also so that their sons have permission to be vulnerable and human too—reclaim those parts of themselves they abandoned and in doing so be a more true and complete version of themselves.\\n\\nYou might be thinking who is this Harry Potter girl? And what is she doing up on stage at the UN. It’s a good question and trust me I have been asking myself the same thing. I don’t know if I am qualified to be here. All I know is that I care about this problem. And I want to make it better.\\n\\nAnd having seen what I’ve seen—and given the chance—I feel it is my duty to say something. English statesman Edmund Burke said: “All that is needed for the forces of evil to triumph is for enough good men and women to do nothing.”\\n\\nIn my nervousness for this speech and in my moments of doubt I’ve told myself firmly—if not me, who, if not now, when. If you have similar doubts when opportunities are presented to you I hope those words might be helpful.\\n\\nBecause the reality is that if we do nothing it will take 75 years, or for me to be nearly a hundred before women can expect to be paid the same as men for the same work. 15.5 million girls will be married in the next 16 years as children. And at current rates it won’t be until 2086 before all rural African girls will be able to receive a secondary education. If you believe in equality, you might be one of those inadvertent feminists I spoke of earlier.\\n\\nAnd for this I applaud you.\\n\\nWe are struggling for a uniting word but the good news is we have a uniting movement. It is called HeForShe. I am inviting you to step forward, to be seen to speak up, To be the he for she. And to ask yourself if not me, who, if not now when.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Editor\\'s note: Carol Costello anchors the 9 to 11 a.m. ET edition of CNN\\'s \"Newsroom\" each weekday.\\n\\n(CNN) -- Happy birthday, Gloria Steinem!\\n\\nThe \"Face of Feminism\" turns 80 Tuesday, and guess what? Feminism seems to be turning the corner -- again. Many young women are now embracing the term and rejecting the notion that feminists are hairy, ugly, man-hating, angry women.\\n\\nHeck, even Beyonce appeared on the cover of Steinem\\'s magazine, Ms., last year.\\n\\nAnd lest critics point to Beyonce\\'s overt sexuality as evidence of her hypocrisy, this year Queen Bey took it a step further and wrote an essay for \"The Shriver Report: A Woman\\'s Nation Pushes Back from the Brink.\" In it, Beyonce Knowles-Carter (note the hyphenated name!) proclaimed that \"gender equality is a myth!\" She went on to write, \"the average working woman earns only 77 percent of what the average working man makes. But unless women and men both say this is unacceptable, things will not change.\"\\n\\nA few years ago, Emma Watson told People magazine of her \"Harry Potter\" character, \"Hermione\\'s not scared to be clever. I think sometimes really smart girls dumb themselves down a bit, and that\\'s bad.\" Watson added she\\'s a lot like Hermione: \"I\\'m a bit of a feminist. I\\'m very competitive and challenging.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s not to say all young women feel the same. Or certain older men.\\n\\n5 reasons why we love Gloria Steinem\\n\\nRush Limbaugh perverts the word \"feminist\" all the time. He likes to call his targets \"feminist extremists\" and \"feminazis.\"\\n\\nIn 2012, Limbaugh took on Georgetown law student Sandra Fluke. She testified before Congress about the need for her Jesuit university to provide contraception insurance coverage for female students.\\n\\nShe even admitted to being an \"American woman who uses contraceptives.\" Oh, my!\\n\\nLimbaugh promptly labeled her a \"feminazi\" and a \"slut.\"\\n\\nOr to quote the big man himself, \"So, Ms. Fluke and the rest of you feminazis, here\\'s the deal. If we are going to pay for your contraceptives, and thus pay for you to have sex, we want something for it, and I\\'ll tell you what it is. We want you to post the videos online so we can all watch.\"\\n\\nIt so evokes Bobby Riggs, right? A pro tennis player who, on September 20, 1973, challenged Billie Jean King to a tennis match because \"the best way to handle women is to keep them barefoot and pregnant.\"\\n\\nCourtney Martin, who co-edited Feministing.com -- a widely read and influential feminist blog -- and author of \"Perfect Girls, Starving Daughters,\" says many young women have been afraid of the word \"feminist\" because it\\'s been the target of a powerful smear campaign for decades. But, thanks largely to the Internet, smears like Limbaugh\\'s are losing their power.\\n\\nAt Feministing.com, she says, \"we get mail from teenaged girls in the middle of Iowa who say ... \\'I stumbled on your site and realized feminism isn\\'t about man-hating and Birkenstocks.\\' \" It\\'s actually \"kind of cool and counter-cultural.\"\\n\\nWow. Really? Martin says yes. Because today\\'s feminist movement realized it had to embrace aesthetics. Beauty and fun and relationships matter, too. So does the cool factor. Jon Stewart, anyone? Stewart has a cultural agenda, he\\'s cool, and young people follow him in droves.\\n\\nJessica Valenti, an author sometimes described as a feminist evangelist, says that when she delivered talks on feminism on college campuses a few years ago, one or two hands went up when she asked who considered themselves a feminist. Today, she says, \"now almost all of them do.\"\\n\\nAnd, says Martin, it\\'s not just because of \"cool\" or contraception or abortion rights. It\\'s because of a more evolved definition of feminism.\\n\\n\"Feminism means a fight for others,\" Martin said. It\\'s about living a \"feminist life.\" That means equality for everyone: women, children and, yes, men. That includes advocating on issues like immigration, human trafficking and so much more.\\n\\nPerhaps Lena Chen, an activist and media commentator for Salon, Glamour and her own blog, put it best. \"In my lifetime feminism has evolved far beyond the binary identity politics of women vs. men,\" she wrote in an e-mail. \"To me, feminism is one part of a larger global movement for liberation. Gender norms dictating how you ought to behave, dress, marry, or work are oppressive regardless of what body you inhabit or how you identify yourself.\"\\n\\nShe says social media have helped many young activists in her generation speak with powerful voices.\\n\\nThey no longer need one \"figurehead\" in \"order to create change.\"\\n\\nThey just need each other.\\n\\nSo, happy birthday, Gloria. On your 80th birthday, feminism has indeed turned a corner. We\\'ll have to see how far it has gone when you turn 90. Or 100.\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.\\n\\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Carol Costello.',\n",

       "  'text': 'My Twitter followers already know that I’m profoundly unimpressed by the latest cover story from the Atlantic magazine titled ‘Why Women Still Can’t Have It All.’\\n\\nThe piece, written by Anne-Marie Slaughter, explains why she left a job at the State Department to return to her tenured position at Princeton. In her words:\\n\\nI realized that I didn’t just need to go home. Deep down, I wanted to go home. I wanted to be able to spend time with my children in the last few years that they are likely to live at home, crucial years for their development into responsible, productive, happy, and caring adults.\\n\\nSlaughter then goes on to extrapolate that women can’t ‘have it all,’ that is full satisfaction and success in their work and home lives. That’s because, she says, workplaces don’t allow enough flexibility for women to make time for their children. And women, she claims, are inherently more committed to being with their children than men, so marriages in which men do the lion’s share of parenting will still leave women feeling emotionally unfulfilled.\\n\\nThere is so much that is wrong with this argument:\\n\\n1. Slaughter’s article is written from a vantage point of extreme privilege. Most women aren’t making choices – they ‘do it all’ because there is no other option. Most women and men would regard a tenured job at Princeton as a high-powered full-time career; Slaughter sees it as a form of settling after giving up her State Department gig. The idea that this is a woman who doesn’t ‘have it all’ is hard to swallow.\\n\\n2. Then there is the essentialism of her claims about the need to make the economy more flexible for women. Women, she says, should not have to see success as meaning working round the clock; women should be encouraged to take more time off. But men, it seems, should be allowed to go on as they have been, working nights and weekends and rarely seeing their children. Because, Slaughter says, it will bother fathers less to have their spouses or a nanny looking after their kids than it will bother mothers.\\n\\nThis is the kind of claim that demands data, and Slaughter has none. She doesn’t make room for women who don’t want children at all, or acknowledge that a great many men hate the pressure put on them to be breadwinners only and fear the ridicule that comes from suggesting they might want to do more parenting.\\n\\n3. Her proposals are weak. The idea that more women in public office will lead to a dramatic change in economic policy for women is a nice thought, but it’s not necessarily true. The suggestion that mandating more parental leave will help is naïve: either only women will take it, furthering the achievement gap at work, or men will take it too, but might use it as a sabbatical to advance their careers or take a vacation, not to focus on parenting. This is one of the many cases where cultural change cannot be simply legislated.\\n\\n4. But, what perhaps bothered me most about the piece, was Slaughter’s narrow understanding of what feminism is. She claims that feminism promised women the following: the ability to have a completely unencumbered, full-time career and a completely involved, cook-dinner-every-day experience of motherhood without making any compromises. This is a straw man.\\n\\nShe counters it with an equally bogus vision of what feminism is: that we validate whatever paths women choose as feminist choices because women make them. This isn’t feminism, because it does nothing to advance the lot of women overall.\\n\\nHere’s what I mean: Slaughter seems blissfully unaware of the consequences of an economy in which some or many women opt for greater flexibility to work fewer hours, but men do not. As I’ve written before, the individual choices of couples where women stay home some or all the time have the aggregate effect of dragging down wages and professional success for women generally.\\n\\nFeminism is about equality. Repeat that until it sinks in.\\n\\nFeminism means giving women equal opportunity and fair pay at work. It means a world where taking time off to be a parent is considered equally legitimate for men and women. It means, fundamentally, a world in which men and women have equal access to the full spectrum of human experience.\\n\\nIt does not mean making a world in which each woman does everything at once, the ‘have it all’ fantasy. It does not mean making a world in which each woman does whatever she wants without consequence, the choice fallacy. It means making a world in which each individual (male or female) can make their own compromises (and life will always involve compromises) without taking away opportunities from others.\\n\\nThat is a radical, utopian vision, to be sure, but it is not the utopia Slaughter claims feminism sold her, or the one she would like us to replace it with.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The world of networked hurt that descended on the spiteful media enterprise that is Rush Limbaugh revealed a tenacious, super-wired coalition of active feminists prepared at a moment’s notice to blow the lid off sexist attacks or regressive health policy. When Limbaugh called Georgetown University law student Sandra Fluke a “slut” and “prostitute” in response to her testimony before Congress on contraception costs, he may well have been surprised by the strength of the response. But he shouldn’t have been.\\n\\nAt latest count, nine advertisers have pulled the plug on Limbaugh. [Update: 12 advertisers and two radio stations.] Each was effectively targeted on Facebook and Twitter by an angry and vocal storm of thousands of people calling for direct action. The campaign was almost instantaneous, coordinated by no individual or organization, and entirely free of cost. Prominent feminist organizers told Forbes that it was social media’s terrible swift sword, led once again by Twitter and Facebook-savvy women, that dealt Limbaugh the worst humiliation of his controversial career, and in many ways, revealed the most potent “non-organized” organization to take the field on the social commons in the age of Occupy Wall Street and Anonymous.\\n\\n“Given that much of the increased vocabulary and awareness about gender in the national discussion comes through social media and from young people, I think that instances like this one should give those who claim that young people don’t care about feminism pause!” says Rebecca Traister, a contributor to Salon and author the important feminist history of the 2008 Presidential race, Big Girls Don’t Cry. “Young people are the ones who know how to use social media in this way, and look at the kind of impact it’s having.”\\n\\n“What’s most interesting to me is that in the last two years or so specifically, women have been leading the charge online to campaign for themselves against this kind of abuse, largely thanks to advances in social networking,” said media technologist Deanna Zandt, author of Share This! How You Will Change the World with Social Networking. ”In the past, we’d have to wait for some organization to take up the cause– create a petition, launch an email campaign — and outside of traditional feminist movement types, those campaigns rarely reached widespread acceptance.”\\n\\n“Women aren’t waiting to be told what to do or which petition to sign, they’re just doing what we do best: talking and connecting,” agreed Allison Fine, senior fellow for progressive think tank Demos.\\n\\nIt’s the next chapter in many ways to the story that hit the public consciousness with the strong, active online reaction to the Susan G. Komen Foundation’s decision to cut funding to Planned Parenthood a month ago. The response was quick, massive, and targeted. My own social graph (on both Facebook and Twitter) lit up like a summer fireworks display after sundown – stirring conversation, concentration around hashtags and shared media, and truly crowdsourced action.\\n\\n“What we’re seeing right now is a continuation of the networked response to the right-wing war on women’s health that began with the Komen reaction a few weeks ago,” said Fine. “It is across generations and extra-organizational with individual women using a variety of social media channels to connect with other women and create their own protests.”\\n\\nYet it would also be a mistake to view the semi-organized reaction to Limbaugh as purely another battle between left and right on the American political spectrum. While Limbaugh’s sexist words have to been seen in the light of a Republican Presidential race that has, inexplicably, placed an opposition to contraception and women’s health at the center of its increasingly nasty public debate, the roots of El Rushbo’s humiliation also run deeper than spectrum ideology and political parties.\\n\\nYou can see those roots, for instance, in the brilliantly-organized campaign in late 2010 against two prominent liberal voices: filmmaker Michael Moore and talk show host Keith Olbermann. Feminist blogger Sady Doyle took Moore to task for posting bail on behalf of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange after rape accusations brought by two women in Sweden confined him to custody in England, and her supporters battled both Moore and Olbermann for being dismissive of those accusations and implying they were a set-up to derail Assange’s exposure of U.S. government secrets.\\n\\nWrote Doyle in December, 2010 in a post that ignited a firestorm: “We are the progressive community. We are the left wing. We are women and men, we are from every sector of this community, and we believe that every rape accusation must be taken seriously, regardless of the accused rapist’s connections, power, influence, status, fame, or politics.”\\n\\nThousands of activists then used the #mooreandme tag on Twitter to (successfully) demand apologies from Moore and Olbermann. That campaign disproves the assertion by Fox News political analyst Kirsten Powers in the Daily Beast that “the real fury seems reserved only for conservatives, while the men on the left get a wink and a nod as long as they are carrying water for the liberal cause.”',\n",

Men have been undeniably effective at maintaining societies that are stable, orderly, and family-oriented.\\n\\nMen built every single civilization, city, and major institution on this planet.

       "  'text': 'ForbesWoman is a new section for professional and executive women. Enter your email below to start receiving ForbesWoman news and updates.\\n\\nAgainst the backdrop of Iran\\'s political turmoil, Iranian-American journalist Roya Hakakian sat down with ForbesWoman to discuss her native country\\'s current climate and the situation facing women--and men--in Iran today.\\n\\nBorn in Tehran, Hakakian is the author of several collections of poetry and Journey from the Land of No, a memoir. She left Iran in 1984 at the age of 18. She has not returned nor has she been permitted to return. She now lives in Connecticut.\\n\\nExcerpts from her interview with ForbesWoman follow.\\n\\nForbes: What was your first reaction to seeing women among the protesters in the streets of Iran?\\n\\nHakakian: The presence of women is not a surprise to me at all.\\n\\nIran has had a robust women\\'s movement for several decades now. But in the late 1990s, a new generation took charge; and in the early 2000s, they managed to organize and unite in ways that women had not since the revolution in 1979. It started as petition movement to collect signatures to ban stoning women to death and has spun out to become the \"One Million Signatures Campaign.\" So this is precisely what I expected.\\n\\nWhat\\'s the extent of risk these demonstrators are taking?\\n\\nBy looking at pictures and YouTube videos, I can see the regime is using certain tactics: Plainclothes operatives with knives circulate through the crowd and bring out these knives and just as they are feeling safe because they are next to like-minded people who are demonstrating too, the operatives start to attack the protesters.\\n\\nWhen one thinks back to 1978 and 1979 and overthrowing the Shah, it\\'s not remotely comparable. Even though I was young, I could see that the people knew who they were demonstrating against. There was a clear face-off between the Shah\\'s guards and armies and the rest of the people. The boundaries were very clear. This regime doesn\\'t honor that.\\n\\nSome reports have noted the regime\\'s use of non-Persian-speaking police. Because the regime is afraid of the police switching loyalties, it has imported crowd control from other Arab countries so demonstrators on street can\\'t communicate with them. Iranians speak Persian and Arabs speak Arabic so they can\\'t be converted and brought to the other side.\\n\\nWomen are not particular targets. At this point, I don\\'t think it really matters to [the regime] whether it\\'s women, men, young or old.\\n\\nWhat provides some measure of safety is the sheer volume of people that have taken to the streets. In the past 15 years, we have never had one million people marching on the streets of Tehran. Students have marched, yes, but there have been more than a million people demonstrating in the past two to three days. The crowds should are fed up and willing to pay the price.\\n\\nIs this a moment of change for women?\\n\\nYes. The feminist movement, which has been ongoing in Iran, has now joined the broader public movement against the regime. This happened in Iran in the late 1970s too, but it had actually a terrible effect on the women\\'s movement in Iran. Women were somehow \"hoodwinked\" to think that the veil wasn\\'t such an important issue, that it was more important to sacrifice for the greater good. So the Shah went and the veil stayed.\\n\\nThis generation is a lot smarter. The broader social movement is far more sympathetic to the cause of women than in the late 1970s. Thirty years later, Iranian men now realize that their fate is entwined with that of their female counterparts: If women are doing better, then men will do better too.\\n\\nDoes Mousavi\\'s wife--Zahra Rahnavard--in any way represent a new face of women in Iran?\\n\\nHer presence on the political scene is, if anything, a manifestation of the strength of the feminist movement. It was a smart strategy to bring her out and make her visible. Mousavi wanted to court women who constitute a huge voting block and are extremely powerful and know how to organize. So, [Rahnavard] speaks more to the feminist movement than anything else.\\n\\nWhat role has the Internet and modern technology played in helping Iranian women to get their message out?\\n\\nI think it\\'s enormous. I have a Facebook page with several hundred people friending me from Iran. These are people I\\'ve never known. They post photographs, film clips, news items. I haven\\'t looked at any television broadcasts I only look at television broadcasts to measure the lag time between what I\\'ve read [on social networks] and the news networks.\\n\\nWhat have you heard in the last several years about the situation for women in Iran? How have their lives changed or stayed the same?\\n\\nIt varies. Life can be very different for women who live in big metropolis and women who are in more remote parts of Iran. It has been a grand metamorphosis since 1979 when the regime started rolling back women\\'s rights and freedoms that had been extended under the Shah, prior to revolution.\\n\\nThe [religious] regime took a very macho approach to governance and saw rolling back the rights of women as a major priority. It instituted the veil and closed major [academic] fields to women, such as law and engineering.\\n\\nBut [the regime] never counted on the enormous backlash and not just from women who had been used to their freedoms. Challenges came from their \"own\" women too. They said, \"We are Muslim, we wear veils on heads and we want to participate. You told us we are brothers and sisters and as long as we are devout, there will be equal opportunity for everybody.\" The regime encouraged religious women who had never thought of themselves outside of the kitchen and home to come out and take part. And as a result, the women thought they were entitled. That was the part of the game the men had not foreseen.\\n\\nThese women helped cultivate a whole generation that previously was not politically active.\\n\\nAt this point, what\\'s your greatest hope for women in Iran?\\n\\nGreater solidarity and commitment to the cause of women.\\n\\nMuch of what we\\'re seeing right now--what we understand to be the huge social campaign against the rigging of the election--really came from the vast activities over the years of the feminist movement. Women were the ones who put together the infrastructure, who organized demonstrations and knew how to do this. The movement today owes a lot of its existence to the women\\'s movement and the infrastructure the women\\'s movement put in place.\\n\\nWhat can individuals around the world do to help show their support for more equality for women in Iran?\\n\\nA ribbon campaign or bumper stickers.\\n\\nAnd we need to keep this in focus. We are far more connected as human beings than we ever were. Our destinies are entwined with one another. The events of Sept. 11 and the rise of global terrorism is a sad reminder of that.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Was feminism necessary to produce Sarah Palin\\'s fine performance at the Republican Convention? She is of course no heroine to radical feminists, who disliked everything she said, but could one rightly say--could they say--that she is indebted to their brand of feminism for the opportunity she used so successfully? I\\'m speaking of the feminism that says that women can be equal to men only when they are held to be the same as men.\\n\\nSarah Palin was appealing and accomplished, with the force of a man and the grace of a woman. But while reaching another, higher first for women, she expressed no gratitude to the women\\'s movement. She has had good words for women politicians like Geraldine Ferraro and Hillary Clinton, but she showed none of the features that betray the feminist in action. On the contrary: She spoke proudly of \"my guy,\" grateful to the man who was hers--implying that she needed him, and that any woman needs a guy of her own. She introduced her children, especially little Trig, the one with Down\\'s syndrome. She was displaying a mother\\'s unconditional love, as opposed to the conditional love that insists on a \"wanted\" child. She did these things unapologetically, quite unafraid of seeming to be a normal, healthy sexist female: one who knows what it is to be a woman and enjoys it.\\n\\nAll Sarah Palin did was to claim her equal opportunity to a job once held exclusively by men. This sort of equality--the opportunity to take on public careers outside the home--is something liberals and conservatives agree on. That conservatives accept it is proven by the rapturous reception she received from Republicans, who greeted her as a political savior.\\n\\nThis she may or may not be, but she seems to have had the effect of enthusing the base, in part because of her sex.\\n\\nAn obvious difference between the women\\'s movement and the civil rights movement is the ease with which the former triumphed. Of course there was male chauvinism at the start, but it was complacent, passive and ineffective. No man could look a woman in the eye and say \"you are not equal to me\" once the issue was put. There was nothing like the \"massive resistance\" to racial desegregation in the South; instead, there was a massive movement of women into jobs and careers.\\n\\nThe early feminists were radicals inspired by Simone de Beauvoir, who thought it necessary to show that all sex differences were bourgeois conventions or stereotypes. They would show this not so much in regard to careers as in sex itself. They bought into the sexual revolution and decided that women could best show they are equal to men by becoming as predatory as the most wolfish men. This demonstration required the fallback assistance of ready abortion in case something should go wrong; and it gave new legitimacy to--this word is never used--spinsterhood. Single-parent families also gained respectability as women pressed their husbands with newly justifiable equality grievances, often leading to divorce.\\n\\nAs sex goes up in social estimation, love goes down. The trouble with love is that it narrows your options and endangers your independence. If you loved a man, you might actually want to put up with, or even admire, his ways. You may be sure that I am not the first one to notice that feminist women are unerotic.\\n\\nIf none of what I am saying were true, feminists would be welcoming Sarah Palin with embraces as warm as they are capable of. They should be happy that their cause has spread to conservatives and become bipartisan. In fact, they see the Palin choice as a gross deceit, and their response is close to fury. Doesn\\'t this suggest that feminism is not in behalf of the women\\'s movement--but rather to promote radical adventures above and beyond its concern for women?\\n\\nSomehow the Palins make a better model for American women--for all women. In truth some sort of feminism was necessary, but the one we had needs a major correction.\\n\\nHarvey Mansfield is professor of government at Harvard and a member of the Hoover Institution\\'s Taskforce on Virtue and Liberty. He is the author, most recently, of Manliness.',\n",

The clip features cursing aplenty (\"Fuck that sexist shit!\") amidst statistics about the pay gap, rape and violence against women.\\n\\nEditor\\'s note: The video below, of course, features NSFW language. And kids cursing up a storm.\\n\\nOf course, the advertisement is just that: an ad for a for-profit company owned by corporate branding firm Synergy Media. The shirts and sweatshirts in FCKH8\\'s \"Anti-Sexism\" collection range in price from $14.99 to $36.99, and $5.00 of each purchase will go toward \"kick-ass charities\" that have yet to be determined.\\n\\nLuke Montgomery, a spokesperson from FCKH8, tells Mashable that customers will vote on a list of charities narrowed down from Facebook suggestions on Nov. 30. Montgomery says that FCKH8 has sold more than 200,000 t-shirts since opening in 2010.\\n\\nPredictably, not everyone is a fan of FCKH8\\'s advertisement. Some have criticized it for profiting from feminist messages and slogans, referencing its controversial campaign linked to protests in Ferguson, Missouri.\\n\\nIn September, the brand released a video featuring children from Ferguson wearing the company\\'s \"Anti-Racism\" shirts. In a similar vein to FCKH8\\'s latest campaign, $5.00 from each purchase were donated to four anti-racism organizations.\\n\\nThe campaign prompted criticism for aiming to make a profit from the Ferguson protests, most notably in a Colorlines blog post on the subject.\\n\\n\"Everything, it seems, can distilled, packaged, bought and sold — including racism,\" Colorlines\\' Aura Bogado wrote.\\n\\nFCKH8 responded with its own blog post, asking for an apology, and a promise to donate funds from the sales to Colorlines\\' publisher, which it declined.\\n\\nAccording to FCKH8\\'s website, the company has since donated $1,047 in profits to Crossroads Anti-Racism Organizing and Training, $1,000 to the Mike Brown Memorial Fund, $1,000 to the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis and $1,000 the NAACP.\\n\\nRemember that FCKH8 is the same company that made a profit off Ferguson by selling Ferguson t-shirts.

The original link to the YouTube page read: \"This video has been removed because its content violated YouTube\\'s Terms of Service,\" and the Vimeo link showed an error.\\n\\nFCKH8 has since replaced it on Vimeo, where it is again available for viewing. Though we originally reported that it was pulled from Vimeo, Mashable has since learned from a Vimeo spokesperson that the video was removed due to an error and was promptly reuploaded to the website.\\n\\n\"It seems like this censorship ... is because of user complaints about kids saying fuck,\" Montgomery told Mashable via email. \"The video does not violate any user guidelines and with all the sexist content on both sites that is allowed to stay up, as well as content that uses this simple four-letter word, we are surprised that they chose to censor it.

       "  'text': 'Move over, Feminist Ryan Gosling — there’s a new Tumblr battling sexism.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, 16 undergraduate students at Duke University launched Who Needs Feminism?, a campaign that encourages feminist and gender egalitarian discussion over social media.\\n\\nThe Tumblr features posters and statements from individuals explaining why feminism is important. Statements range from the personal to the global, including “I need feminism because it’s 2012 and only 3% of Fortune 500 CEOs are women,” and “I need feminism because I want to be respected, regardless of what I’m wearing.”\\n\\nWho Needs Feminism? began as the final project for the students’ seminar course, Women in the Public Sphere, the only guideline of which was to focus on social change.\\n\\n“We discussed this extensively and concluded that there is a disturbingly apathetic sentiment toward feminism, both on campus and on a broader societal scale,” says Amy Fryt, a senior at Duke’s Trinity College of Arts & Sciences. “We aim to challenge existing stereotypes surrounding feminists and assert the importance of feminism today.”\\n\\nAll 16 students on the Who Needs Feminism? team came from a variety of backgrounds, networks and social groups, which enabled them to connect with a large audience. Each student is female, but various male and transgender feminists have submitted to the Tumblr. One poster from a male Duke student reads, “I need feminism because too many people of my gender find sexual assault excusable on our campus.”\\n\\nThe Who Needs Feminism? team originally planned for the project to focus on Duke’s campus, but it quickly spread beyond that.\\n\\n“Students from other schools started reaching out to us to start Who Needs Feminism? campaigns at their own schools,” says Laura Kuhlman, a junior at Duke’s Trinity College of Arts & Sciences. “We’ve gotten posts from Duke alumni saying that they are proud of the university for taking this stance and posts from people who say that this campaign inspires them.”\\n\\nKuhlman says that they identified Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter as the main components of their social media strategy early on. “As college students, these are the platforms we use most frequently and we knew that we’d get an expansive reach. We initially thought Facebook would serve as our main source of promotion, but the Tumblr has really taken off,” she says.\\n\\nSince many users have uploaded and submitted their own photos, Kuhlman says that the Tumblr is a great way to encourage discussion without the moderation that the Facebook page requires.\\n\\nThe Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter accounts all interact to promote the general campaign. According to the Who Needs Feminism? team, the Facebook page received over 4,200 likes within 36 hours of the project’s launch. As of last night, their Tumblr had been accessed by people in 2,509 different cities, has earned 30,000 pageviews and had been viewed by almost 13,000 people.\\n\\nAt the time of this posting, the Facebook page has well over 5,500 likes and counting.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The Women’s March on Washington on Jan. 21 is an apt metaphor for the moment: movement as primal scream. It grew out of a post on Facebook, was unconnected to any established women’s organization, and has no set list of demands. Hundreds of thousands of women say they are going, but will their anger turn into a broader movement?\\n\\n“We need a ‘come to Jesus’ moment,” said C. Nicole Mason of the Center for Research and Policy in the Public Interest at the New York Women’s Foundation. “I feel like the denial is very severe.”\\n\\nIn the weeks after the election, in conversations with nearly two dozen advocates for women, I heard the fractures of a movement still regrouping after an unexpected defeat. They know that Mrs. Clinton didn’t stand for the feminist movement directly, and that you could vote against her without saying you were voting against feminism. But one of the movement’s goals was shattering that ultimate glass ceiling. Some say the failure to do so was so devastating that now is the time to rebuild from the ground up. Others insist now is the time to stay the course.\\n\\nThe challenges are a proxy for the questions the Democratic Party must face over class, race, identity politics and tactics. The women’s movement must balance how to broaden its message without losing its base. Courting the white working class could alienate black women still smarting over white women voting for a man whom many saw as racist — a choice that seemed to put racial identity over gender solidarity. Some younger women shun the feminist label altogether. It’s not clear how far the tent can stretch without leaving some outside.\\n\\nThe overall struggle is to stay relevant in the age of Trump. “Before the election, even I was stunned by the sheer number of people I knew who came forward saying they’d been survivors of sexual assault,” said Vivien Labaton, co-executive director of Make It Work Action, which promotes working families’ economic security. “It’s amazing to me the lightning speed at which these issues have receded. The story is the total omission of women. Overnight.”\\n\\nMany veterans of the women’s movement bristle at the thought that the election was a rejection of feminism. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by the largest recorded margin for a defeated candidate and won the majority of all women’s votes. Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation, cites a poll commissioned from Lake Associates conducted on the eve of the election. It found that 59 percent of women voters over all, and 59 percent of younger women, identify as feminists, up from 2012.\\n\\nHeather Booth, long active in the movement, notes that polls consistently show majority support for child care, equal pay, prohibitions against sexual discrimination and the right to abortion. Ms. Smeal’s and many other groups have reported intensified mobilization, donations and volunteerism after the election. For many, the defeat may well be an awakening, a visible sign of barriers they thought had been swept away.\\n\\nBut this consensus masks real struggles.\\n\\nAlthough exit polls suggest that a majority of young women voted for Mrs. Clinton, their enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders during the primary seemed to say that for some, feminism’s traditional preoccupations seem out of date.\\n\\nIn late October, when the polls indicated that Mrs. Clinton would win, I sought out young women to talk about their perceptions of her. Jessica Salans, 27, who is running for local office in Los Angeles in 2017, said she found Mrs. Clinton’s feminism outdated, failing to prioritize climate change, income inequality and the toll of American intervention overseas.\\n\\n“I saw a great documentary about the second-wave feminist movement, and it made me realize why people like Gloria Steinem were coming out in support of Hillary Clinton,” she said. The brand of feminism that spoke to her, though, wasn’t about breaking historic barriers. It was more specific: “progressive feminism, eco-feminism.”\\n\\nTo many inside and outside the feminist movement, the Clinton campaign message missed the mark.\\n\\n“White working-class women saw Hillary Clinton as another privileged white woman wanting to break the glass ceiling,” said Joan C. Williams, professor at University of California Hastings College of the Law. “That metaphor makes sense if your central goal is to gain access to jobs that privileged men have. Hillary’s feminism was not about them.”\\n\\nFeminism, which at its heart should mean opportunities for women in every sphere, has also come to be seen as a proxy for liberalism, alienating conservatives.\\n\\nS. E. Cupp, a columnist for The Daily News in New York and a conservative who did not vote for Mr. Trump, said: “There’s a condescension that comes across from some in the women’s movement. There’s this idea that if you’re not liberal, you’re a traitor to your gender. Is our message alienating entire groups of people, including women?”\\n\\nShe raised the provocative possibility that many women believed that Mr. Trump would keep the country safe in part because of his paternalistic, alpha male persona — and that was an implicit rejection of feminism’s attempts to redefine gender roles.\\n\\nOthers worry that the women’s movement has spent too much time policing language and behavior, blaming and shaming at the expense of dialogue. That, Professor Williams argues, can make misogyny attractive to the white working class, a way to rebel against condescending elites.\\n\\nThe answer, some argue, is rebranding feminism — recasting issues in economic terms relevant to the working class, men as well as women.\\n\\n“While the working families agenda is very strong, it’s not big enough to get the country back on its feet,” said Celinda Lake, a longtime Democratic pollster. “It needs to be embedded in a bigger economic message. Sometimes we talk about it in ways that make it sound like it’s just for women, to the exclusion of men.”\\n\\nBy contrast, she said, Mr. Trump’s economic platform was clear and compelling. Mrs. Clinton’s calls for equal pay, child care, paid family leave and health insurance that covered birth control and mammograms, paled before the appeal of someone who promised to bring back better-paying manufacturing jobs and restore a lost standard of living.\\n\\nThe key is to link the two messages, to take issues that benefit women and show how they help families as a whole.\\n\\nMs. Lake described a focus group on equal pay she conducted with white union members in Michigan. She found that men were enthusiastic if they connected it with their own economic security. “One guy said, ‘If the little lady doesn’t get paid the same as I do, I need to get overtime and there’s no OT anymore.’ ” The other men in the room, she said, agreed with him.\\n\\nMen may also be more receptive when the message is applied to their daughters. Reshma Saujani runs the group Girls Who Code, aimed at preparing girls for careers in technology. She noted that when her organization tried to persuade parents to enroll their girls, abstract appeals to gender equity fell flat. Evoking fathers’ dreams for their daughters had more resonance.\\n\\n“You’ve lost your home but your daughter has a shot at going back up to the middle class,” she said, explaining why that kind of pitch succeeded. “We have to talk to different parts of the country differently. We can’t make the same gender arguments — it doesn’t work.”\\n\\nIn these postelection conversations, the rawest wounds were expressed by black women who felt betrayed by white women’s support for Mr. Trump. These women worry that the national chest-beating about identity politics and the resolve to win back the white working class will come at their expense, subordinating issues of racial justice.\\n\\n“You blame the people who voted for him, not the ones who didn’t,” said Salamishah Tillet, an associate professor of English and Africana studies at the University of Pennsylvania.\\n\\nEarly organizers of the women’s march faced scorn for initially failing to include minority women in leadership positions, then drew fire for the original name of the event — Million Woman March — which appropriated the name of a march by black women in 1997.\\n\\n“Ashes to ashes, dust to white liberal feminism,” wrote LeRhonda Manigault-Bryant, associate professor of Africana studies at Williams College, in an impassioned open letter noting that white feminists now shared the kind of fears long known to black women.\\n\\nRather than playing down race, these women argue it’s essential to recognize its interconnection with feminism. Allowing racism to fester, they say, threatens not only black women but also white women, because it encourages white nationalism, which is also hostile to women’s rights.\\n\\nBut building bridges across racial and ethnic lines requires white feminists to understand that their experience is not universal, Professor Manigault-Bryant said. And it means defining women’s issues as broadly as possible.\\n\\nOne of the paradoxes of 2016 was that some referendums on issues dear to the women’s movement passed on the local level, from tax increases to expand child care programs in Ohio to raising the minimum wage in four states. Advocates see opportunities in localities, a key battleground. The Michigan People’s Campaign focused on a statehouse district called Downriver Detroit, dispatching campaigners door to door to talk across party lines about issues like caring for the elderly, disabled relatives and children. Their progressive candidate won the local election, although Mr. Trump carried the same district.\\n\\nOthers see ballot initiatives as a potent weapon. “Maybe this moment was tailor-made for ballot measures as a critical form of policy making and protest,” said Justine Sarver, executive director of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center. The center conducted polling in 11 states and found wide support for issues like equal pay, child care, paid family leave and higher wages, and is gearing up for the 2018 midterm elections.\\n\\nIn the end, it’s hard to argue that this election over all was a vote for the subordination of women. But it’s a warning that feminism, as it has been defined, did not inspire enough people in enough places around the country. You didn’t hear explicit calls for women to stay at home or be subservient to men, although it’s an open question how many Americans are receptive to questioning traditional gender roles. Many who care about the place of women in American society are gripped by fears that men will now feel they have a free pass to demean women at home or in the workplace, that women’s health, economic security and reproductive rights will be dealt severe blows.\\n\\nTalking to women who voted for Mr. Trump, I found many who were working, divorced or single, opinionated and outspoken. They saw Hillary Clinton as a menace and Donald Trump as an agent of change, if a flawed one. Many were living what might be called liberated lives.\\n\\nThe challenge for the women’s movement is to convince more of the electorate that feminism is not merely a luxury for the privileged or indeed the province only of liberals, but rather essential, to the freedom of every woman and her choices.',\n",

       "  'text': 'But I do remember that when I moved to the U.S. — and I think maybe there are different standards for people who are supposed to be particularly intellectual or particularly creative — I very quickly realized that if you want to seem as a serious writer, you can’t possibly look like a person who looks in the mirror.\\n\\nWhy do you think things that are associated with femininity, like fashion and beauty, are not taken seriously?\\n\\nIt’s about a culture that diminishes women. The things we traditionally think of as masculine are not things our culture dismisses as frivolous. Sports, for example, we think of as masculine. It’s something that our culture takes quite seriously.\\n\\nI think it’s part of a larger picture of a world that simply doesn’t give women the same status that it gives men. There are many examples, and some have more serious consequences. All over the world, there is violence against women, and many cultures have ways of justifying it or minimizing it. But I think you can actually draw a line from that to other feminine pursuits that culture diminishes.\\n\\nWhy did you finally decide to wear makeup, no matter what people thought?\\n\\nIt’s getting older. You realize there’s very little time for rubbish. You realize life is short, and it’s so much better to be who you are. When I was younger, I didn’t have the sense of self to do that.\\n\\nBut it’s interesting because even when I didn’t wear makeup in the U.S., I wore makeup in Nigeria because I wanted to look my age and not too young. In Nigeria, in particular, it was easy for men to dismiss what I said because they thought I looked like a small girl. I remember seeing a man at the airport after my first novel was published, and he looked at me, quite quizzical, and said, “You look like the writer.” And I said, “Well, I’m kind of her.” His face fell. And he said, “I didn’t think the writer would be such a small girl.” There was such disappointment on his face.\\n\\nAt some point, I wanted to be who I am. And who I am is a person who enjoys, from time to time, putting a bright color on my lips.\\n\\nWhat are your thoughts on the #nomakeup movement, exemplified by both Alicia Keys and, more recently, Hillary Clinton?\\n\\nWomen have choices to make. When you’re not feeling good, you don’t have the energy to do your face the way you usually do. I really respect Alicia Keys’s choice not to wear makeup because she felt it was a mask. And she feels now that she’s more truly herself. I think, “Amen to that.” If makeup feels that way for you, then don’t do it. We have to allow women a multiplicity.\\n\\nWhy do you think we don’t?\\n\\nI think people will judge appearance. Humans are visual beings. We notice because we have eyes. What I would love to see changed is the baggage we bring to those judgments. When we see a man who’s well dressed, we don’t assume that he must be shallow or he must not be a serious person.\\n\\nTalking about men is helpful because we can then say, “If this woman who we are judging were male, and everything else stayed the same, would we judge her the same way?” I think that would be a fair way to think of it.\\n\\nA lot of this is especially important to teenagers and women in their 20s. If you were speaking to this group directly, what would you say?\\n\\nThere’s no such thing as perfection. Originality is a beautiful thing. I think it’s much harder now than when I was younger because we didn’t really have the internet. I would say don’t watch too many of those beauty YouTube or makeup videos. They use way too much product. There’s a lot the industry can do. It’s important to have a much wider range of what’s considered beautiful.\\n\\nWhy did you decide to attend the Dior show at Paris Fashion Week this fall?\\n\\nAs a writer, I sort of think of myself as anthropologist. I thought I might be able to collect material. No, but I really went because I really admire the new Dior creative director. She’s such an intelligent, thoughtful, interesting, honest woman. She’s really just my kind of woman. It seemed strange to me that this great, storied fashion house caters to women, and a woman hadn’t been a creative director before.\\n\\nWill you continue to be a presence in the fashion world?\\n\\nIf you were raised by Grace Adichie, my mother, you had better be interested in fashion. From the time I was a little girl, my mother would dress me up. She would put some of her jewelry on me. I’m a bit of a shoe fiend. I make no apologies for it. The first makeup I used was my mother’s lip gloss. I remember putting on a lot of it, so it was quite shiny. She didn’t mind at all. She said, “You look like you ate hot jollof rice and didn’t wipe it off.”\\n\\nThere’s a part of me that likes shoes, and likes dresses, and likes makeup, and likes books, and likes to write. I think that’s the case for many women. But our culture makes us think we have to choose slices of ourselves that we’re comfortable showing the world.\\n\\nDo you consider fashion and makeup entry points to a wider audiences?\\n\\nI decided to do this No7 thing because I thought it might be fun, and then they will give me free makeup. And I’m always up for free things. It wasn’t a carefully calculated thing. It was actually just my being blinded by the selfish overwhelming love of makeup. But I have to be honest, there were times when I thought, “Well, what have I done?” I wasn’t quite aware of how many pictures of me would be out there. It makes me feel a little vulnerable. I told my friends to stop sending me pictures of when they see me at the bus stop in London or something. It’d be very dishonest to say it’s all wonderful. It’s not so much a question of regret. But it does come with feelings of vulnerability that can be uncomfortable.',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON — THE Clinton campaign is shellshocked over the wholesale rejection of Hillary by young women, younger versions of herself who do not relate to her.\\n\\nHillary’s coronation was predicated on a conviction that has just gone up in smoke. The Clintons felt that Barack Obama had presumptuously snatched what was rightfully hers in 2008, gliding past her with his pretty words to make history before she could.\\n\\nSo this time, the Clintons assumed, the women who had deserted Hillary for Barack, in Congress and in the country, owed her. Democrats would want to knock down that second barrier.\\n\\nHillary believed that there was an implicit understanding with the sisters of the world that now was the time to come back home and vote for a woman. (The Clintons seem to have conveniently forgotten how outraged they were by identity politics when black leaders deserted them in 2008 to support Obama.)\\n\\nThis attitude intensified the unappetizing solipsistic subtext of her campaign, which is “What is Hillary owed?” It turned out that female voters seem to be looking at Hillary as a candidate rather than as a historical imperative. And she’s coming up drastically short on trustworthiness.\\n\\nAs Olivia Sauer, an 18-year-old college freshman who caucused for Bernie Sanders in Ames, Iowa, told a Times reporter: “It seems like he is at the point in his life when he is really saying what he is thinking. With Hillary, sometimes you get this feeling that all of her sentences are owned by someone.”\\n\\nHillary started, both last time and this, from a place of entitlement, as though if she reads her résumé long enough people will surrender. And now she’s even angrier that she has been shown up by someone she considers even less qualified than Obama was when he usurped her place.\\n\\nBernie has a clear, concise “we” message, even if it’s pie-in-the-sky: The game is rigged and we have to take the country back from the privileged few and make it work for everyone. Hillary has an “I” message: I have been abused and misunderstood and it’s my turn.\\n\\nIt’s a victim mind-set that is exhausting, especially because the Clintons’ messes are of their own making.\\n\\nOn the trail in New Hampshire, Madeleine Albright made the case that it was a betrayal of feminist ideals to support Bernie against Hillary, noting that “there’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other.” When Sanders handily won the women’s vote on Tuesday, David Axelrod noted dryly that they were going to need to clear out a lot of space in hell.\\n\\nAnd in a misstep for the feminist leader who got famous by going undercover as a Playboy bunny, Gloria Steinem told Bill Maher that young women were flocking to Bernie to be where the boys are. Blaming it on hormones was odd, given the fact that for centuries, it was widely believed that women’s biology made them emotionally unfit to be leaders.\\n\\nWhat the three older women seemed to miss was that the young women supporting Sanders are living the feminist dream, where gender no longer restricts and defines your choices, where girls grow up knowing they can be anything they want. The aspirations of ’70s feminism are now baked into the culture.\\n\\nThe interesting thing about the spectacle of older women trying to shame younger ones on behalf of Hillary is that Hillary and Bill killed the integrity of institutional feminism back in the ’90s — with the help of Albright and Steinem.\\n\\nInstead of just admitting that he had had an affair with Monica Lewinsky and taking his lumps, Bill lied and hid behind the skirts of his wife and female cabinet members, who had to go out before the cameras and vouch for his veracity, even when it was apparent he was lying.\\n\\nSeeing Albright, the first female secretary of state, give cover to President Clinton was a low point in women’s rights. As was the New York Times op-ed by Steinem, arguing that Lewinsky’s will was not violated, so no feminist principles were violated. What about Clinton humiliating his wife and daughter and female cabinet members? What about a president taking advantage of a gargantuan power imbalance with a 22-year-old intern? What about imperiling his party with reckless behavior that put their feminist agenda at risk?\\n\\nIt rang hollow after the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings. When it was politically beneficial, the feminists went after Thomas for bad behavior and painted Hill as a victim. And later, when it was politically beneficial, they defended Bill’s bad behavior and stayed mute as Clinton allies mauled his dalliances as trailer trash and stalkers.\\n\\nThe same feminists who were outraged at the portrayal of Hill by David Brock — then a Clinton foe but now bizarrely head of one of her “super PACs” — as “a little bit nutty and a little bit slutty,” hypocritically went along when Hillary and other defenders of Bill used that same aspersion against Lewinsky.\\n\\nHillary knew that she could count on the complicity of feminist leaders and Democratic women in Congress who liked Bill’s progressive policies on women. And that’s always the ugly Faustian bargain with the Clintons, not only on the sex cover-ups but the money grabs: You can have our bright public service side as long as you accept our dark sketchy side.\\n\\nYoung women today, though, are playing by a different set of rules. And they don’t like the Clintons setting themselves above the rules.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Also, has Steinem forgotten about lesbians? More than a few of them support Sanders, and it’s not because of the way some 26-year-old doctoral candidate looks in his L. L. Bean flannel.\\n\\nThere’s a weird strain of thought swirling around Clinton’s campaign: that we should vote for her because she’s a woman. Or that she’s inoculated from certain flaws or accusations by dint of gender. Or that, at the least, there’s an onus on forward-looking people who care about gender inequality to promote her candidacy.\\n\\nI care about gender inequality, and I don’t buy it. It’s bad logic. It’s even worse strategy. People don’t vote out of shame. They vote out of hope.\\n\\nPerhaps that was among the lessons of Clinton’s defeat in New Hampshire on Tuesday, where she lost to Sanders among all women by at least seven percentage points, according to exit polling, and among women under 30 by more than 60 points.\\n\\nClinton is on sturdy ground, morally and tactically, when she mentions a double standard for women. So are her surrogates. Actually, there are so many double standards that you couldn’t fit them in a column eight times the length of this one, and she has bumped into plenty, including, yes, the fuss over her raised voice.\\n\\nBut the argument that she’s somehow not a full-fledged member of the establishment because she’s a woman — as she contended during the most recent Democratic debate — is nonsense. On that night, she also echoed a past statement to CBS News that she “cannot imagine anyone being more of an outsider than the first woman president.”\\n\\nReally? Anyone? Off the top of my head I can think of a person who might quibble with that. His name is Barack Obama.\\n\\nAdmittedly, there’s no easy way to navigate the terrain she inhabits. Eight years ago, she denied her campaign the romantic sweep of Obama’s by playing down and trying to correct for gender. This time around, she was advised, rightly, not to repeat that mistake. But how to do that without going too far?\\n\\nI think she started out perfectly, with incontestable reflections on women’s challenges in the workplace and with casual asides about the historic nature of her bid. Discussing her age, she said, “I will be the youngest woman president in the history of the United States.”\\n\\nBut more recently, things have fallen out of whack. Bill Clinton’s diatribe about the misogyny of some Sanders supporters sounded like a defensive outsourcing of blame for the Clinton campaign’s disappointments in the polls and the returns: the narrowest of victories in Iowa followed by the resounding New Hampshire defeat.\\n\\nThe Clintons are always quick to point fingers and slow to look in the mirror. On top of which, Bill Clinton’s invocation of sexism felt too pat, his citation of gross language on Twitter (which, sadly, brims with it) too easy.\\n\\nClinton’s gender indeed matters. Just as you couldn’t properly evaluate Obama’s arc without factoring in race, you can’t see her accurately without recognizing that she’s a woman of her time, with all the attendant obstacles, hurts, compromises and tenacity.\\n\\nThat informs — and, ideally, illuminates — her perspective. And her presidency would carry a powerful, constructive symbolism that can’t and shouldn’t be ignored.\\n\\nBut those are considerations among many, many others in taking her measure and in casting a vote. To focus only or primarily on them is more reductive than respectful, and to tell women in particular what kind of politics they should practice is the antithesis of feminism, which advocates independence and choices.\\n\\nWe’re all complicated people voting for complicated people. We’re not census subgroups falling in line.\\n\\nI’ll go to the barricades for that imagined gay candidate if he or she has talents I trust, positions I respect and a character I admire. If not, I’ll probably go elsewhere, because being gay won’t be the sum of that person, just as womanhood isn’t where Clinton begins and ends.',\n",

       "  'date': '2016021019',\n",
       "  'text': \"In the cold open of “Full Frontal With Samantha Bee,” her new weekly show Mondays on TBS, Ms. Bee addressed the elephant in the man cave.\\n\\nThe sketch had her taking questions at a news conference, all of which had to do with the challenges of hosting the show as a woman. (“How can I watch your show as a man?” one person asked.) Her secret, she said, was “hard work, a great team, maybe just a little bit of magic” — and the scene cut to Ms. Bee at the center of a horror-movie occult ritual: “We’re all witches!”\\n\\nIf the setup was that people were obsessed with Ms. Bee being the lone female host in late-night (or, at 10:30 p.m. Eastern, almost-late-night) TV, the punch line was that she was glad to embrace the role and to be fearsome in it. There was no uptalking or shy self-deprecation; she swaggered forward in the title sequence, to the grind of “Boys Wanna Be Her” by Peaches. It was go time.\\n\\nThe 2016 presidential campaign has yet to produce a distinctive comedy voice, but Ms. Bee made a bold early case that it could be hers. She took the stage standing — no desk for her — and moved into a caustic, basic-cable profanity-laced set on the presidential campaigns. The most important thing about the first episode of a political comedy show is to set a tone, and Ms. Bee’s was fiery and fierce — the acid delivery, cut with a touch of Canadian syrup, she honed as a correspondent on “The Daily Show.”\\n\\nThere were some jabs at Democrats — Bernie Sanders was old, “Hermione Clinton” was ambitious — but she saved her sharpest jibes for the Republicans, whose most recent debate, she said, “was a cascade of fail.”\\n\\nDonald J. Trump was “an oddly tinted compilation of psychiatric symptoms” and a “sentient ‘caps lock’ button.” And Marco Rubio’s assertion that Hillary Clinton supported abortion until a pregnant woman’s due date was “the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.” Mr. Rubio, Ms. Bee joked, was implying that Mrs. Clinton wanted to deliver babies “directly into a Vitamix so that Planned Parenthood can sell it to Whole Foods.”\\n\\nThe political topics in the first “Full Frontal” might have been on any late-night show. But Ms. Bee’s feminist perspective showed in the angles that she took — a reel of past election moments included Barack Obama in a 2008 debate, telling Mrs. Clinton she was “likable enough” — and in the stories she highlighted, like a Kansas state senator who established a dress code for women testifying before his committee.\\n\\nWould another late-night show have made these points? Sure, maybe, eventually. On “Full Frontal,” though, “eventually” was now.\\n\\nMs. Bee’s first half-hour was fast-paced and tightly packed. It wisely dispensed with in-studio interviews, instead featuring a field segment — this week, a Werner Herzog-like documentary on Jeb Bush’s New Hampshire campaign, styled as an existential tragedy of ennui. (Asked “If Jeb were a drink, what drink would he be?” a supporter answered, “Milk.”)\\n\\n“Full Frontal” is TV’s latest answer to the multiple-choice question: Who, if anyone, will be the next Jon Stewart? Ms. Bee is one of many “Daily Show” alumni on the nighttime circuit: Stephen Colbert on CBS, John Oliver on HBO, Trevor Noah and Larry Wilmore on Comedy Central. (Even Seth Meyers, with his “A Closer Look” desk segments on NBC’s “Late Night,” is doing a version of “Daily Show” deep dives into the news, by way of his old “Saturday Night Live” Weekend Update segments.)\\n\\nYet although you would think the 2016 election should be a slam-dunk for these comics, it’s been more like a jump ball. They’ve seemed especially stumped about how to turn Mr. Trump into memorable humor. Late-night comedy is trained to spoof conventional, self-serious campaigns. How do you parody someone who brags that he could “shoot somebody” but not lose votes? When reality makes the jokes, all comics can do is supply a rimshot.\\n\\nMs. Bee might have room to stand out in a few ways. A weekly show — like Mr. Oliver’s “Last Week Tonight,” which returns from hiatus on Sunday — could free her from chasing the 24-hour news cycle. And for a female comic in the boys’ club, the Democratic campaign, with its controversies over gender double standards and Bernie Bros, could practically count as stealth marketing.\\n\\nAt 46, Ms. Bee is also generationally between the many millennial women who support Mr. Sanders and second-wave feminists like Gloria Steinem, who are urging solidarity with Mrs. Clinton. Ms. Bee referred to that divide, too, imagining Mrs. Clinton telling young women to “enjoy the breast-pump rooms and maiden names that I won them with my pain.”\\n\\nThere’s another woman jumping into this fray. But if the first episode of “Full Frontal” is any indication, Samantha Bee won’t be feeling the pain, she’ll be bringing it.\\n\\nA version of this review appears in print on February 10, 2016, on page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: A Late-Night Shot of Fierce Feminism.

       "  'text': \"Fatema Mernissi, a Moroccan sociologist who was one of the founders of Islamic feminism, whose work included studies of the sexual politics of Islamic Scripture and a memoir of her childhood in a domestic harem, died on Nov. 30 in Rabat. She was 75.\\n\\nThe cause was cancer, said her literary agent, Edite Kroll.\\n\\nA longtime faculty member of Mohammed V University in Rabat, the capital, Professor Mernissi, who wrote in Arabic, French and English, published and lectured worldwide.\\n\\nHer best-known English-language books include “Beyond the Veil: Male-Female Dynamics in Modern Muslim Society,” which was first published in 1975 and is still considered a touchstone in the field; “Islam and Democracy: Fear of the Modern World” (1992, translated by Mary Jo Lakeland); and her memoir, “Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood” (1994), with photographs by Ruth V. Ward.\\n\\n“Muslim women are now producing the most exciting feminist writing being published anywhere,” The Guardian, the British newspaper, wrote in 1992. Professor Mernissi, it added, “is the most highly regarded among them.”\\n\\nThroughout her work, Professor Mernissi, who favored a moderate, inclusive Islam, emphasized that her deep study of religious texts had turned up little support for women’s long subordination. That reading, she argued, sprang from centuries of misinterpretation by male leaders intent on maintaining the sexual status quo.\\n\\n“Not only have the sacred texts always been manipulated, but manipulation of them is a structural characteristic of the practice of power in Muslim societies,” Professor Mernissi wrote in “The Veil and the Male Elite: A Feminist Interpretation of Women’s Rights in Islam” (1991, translated by Ms. Lakeland). “Since all power, from the seventh century on, was only legitimated by religion, political forces and economic interests pushed for the fabrication of false traditions.”\\n\\nOne of the primary ways in which this manipulation played out, Professor Mernissi argued, was in Islam’s time-honored control of the physical space that women are allowed to occupy. The most — or, more accurately, the least — visible manifestation of such control was the domestic harem.\\n\\nDomestic harems, Professor Mernissi stressed, were nothing like the silk-hung dens of iniquity presided over by sultans and long popularized in Western film and literature. They were instead, quite simply, sequestered multigenerational living quarters for the female members of an extended family. Through his harem, a man maintained his honor by preserving his wives and daughters from the eyes of male outsiders.\\n\\n“It is the Ottoman imperial harem that has fascinated the West almost to the point of obsession,” Professor Mernissi wrote in her memoir. “By contrast,” she added, “domestic harems are rather dull, for they have a strong bourgeois dimension.”\\n\\nIt was into just such a harem that Fatema Mernissi was born on Sept. 27, 1940, in Fez, the daughter of a prosperous family.\\n\\nThe harem’s matriarch, her grandmother, had been one of her grandfather’s nine wives. Though Professor Mernissi’s father, a monogamist, was a progressive in many respects, he favored the traditional segregation of the sexes that the harem provided.\\n\\nThe Mernissi harem comprised a set of secluded quarters within the family’s expansive home. The women were rarely allowed to venture outside the house, and when they were, they did so — veiled — escorted by a male relative.\\n\\n“A harem was about private space and the rules regulating it,” Professor Mernissi wrote in her memoir. “Once you knew what was forbidden, you carried the harem within.” She added, “Ours in Fez was like a fortress.”\\n\\nInside, the women dreamed of transgressing its confines. They sustained one another with stories, songs and, when they could spirit away the key to the radio cabinet, quiet news of the outside world.\\n\\nMany, including Professor Mernissi’s mother, chafed openly.\\n\\n“I would wake up at dawn,” Professor Mernissi recalled her mother saying. “If I only could go for a walk in the early morning when the streets are deserted. The light must be blue then, or maybe pink, like at sunset. What is the color of the morning in the deserted, silent streets?”\\n\\nProfessor Mernissi added, “No one answered her questions.”\\n\\nEspecially popular among the women were tales of Scheherazade, the Arab queen of legend who used her verbal skill to pre-empt execution. Professor Mernissi came to venerate her as a feminist heroine and in 2001 published “Scheherazade Goes West: Different Cultures, Different Harems,” a book-length study of her influence.\\n\\nUnlike her mother and grandmother, who were uneducated, Professor Mernissi was a beneficiary of the nationalist fervor that had arisen in Morocco in the 1930s as the country sought to break free of French dominion.\\n\\nAs a young child she attended nationalist schools, where she was educated alongside male classmates. In 1956, when Morocco won its independence, the nationalists’ reforms included the dissolution of harems throughout the country.\\n\\nProfessor Mernissi received a degree in sociology from Mohammed V University, did graduate work at the Sorbonne and earned a Ph.D. from Brandeis University. Her dissertation became her first book, “Beyond the Veil.”\\n\\nBecause of the politically charged nature of her work, Professor Mernissi sometimes found her public lectures interrupted by protests from Islamic fundamentalists. But for the most part — owing in no small measure to the careful phrasing and rigorous scholarly documentation of her writings — she was left alone.\\n\\n“At least in Morocco, you can’t be put into jail for writing something, unlike most of the other Arab countries,” she told The Toronto Globe and Mail in 1982. “If those fanatics from the Moslem Brothers show up and try to interrupt my talk, they must be thrown out. I know now how to handle them. I won’t let them interrupt my work.”\\n\\nNor did she exempt the West from criticism on matters of sexual politics. Where the East subordinated women by controlling space, Professor Mernissi argued, the West created a vast de facto harem by controlling time.\\n\\n“The Western man,” she wrote, “declares that in order to be beautiful, a woman must look 14 years old. If she dares to look 50, or worse, 60, she is beyond the pale.

       "  'date': '2015100419',\n",
       "  'text': \"The Black Panther Party at its peak, circa 1968: young African-American men sporting black berets and leather coats, awe-inspiring Afros, raised fists on campuses, megaphones on street corners and rifles on the steps of the California State Capitol.\\n\\nBy 1970, Tom Wolfe had canonized these images as “radical chic” in his famous cover article for New York magazine when he wrote, “These are no civil-rights Negroes wearing gray suits three sizes too big,” adding, “these are real men!”\\n\\nFrom media coverage to popular memory, most representations of the Black Panther Party have largely focused on its male leaders, the founders Huey Newton and Bobby Seale, and the minister of information, Eldridge Cleaver. And yet, the group that began in Oakland in 1964 as the Black Panther Party for Self Defense, with its main organizing efforts targeting disaffected young African-American men in cities, was over two-thirds women by the end of the 1960s.\\n\\nAs Stanley Nelson’s new documentary, “The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution,” now in release, reminds us, the party struggled with these founding gender contradictions. As women increasingly reached all levels of the organization, male leaders had mixed responses to their push for equality.\\n\\nThe party’s media strategy continued to valorize the images of its revolutionary men. By the beginning of the next decade, however, Newton began incorporating demands for gender and sexual equality as part of the party’s platform — even as, Mr. Nelson’s film shows, his personal actions toward women might have violently contradicted his progressive philosophy.\\n\\n“We knew going into the film that by the early 1970s, women were the majority of the party,” Mr. Nelson said in a phone interview. “But we also knew that’s not how the story is usually told, so telling that became one of the objectives.”\\n\\nLike their male counterparts, young women joined the Black Panthers because they believed in its platform of armed self-defense to end police brutality and state violence. They also saw themselves as “vanguards,” militant advocates for the economic and political equality of African-Americans here at home and allies of the Communist movements in Cuba, China, Mozambique and Vietnam.\\n\\nBut, like so many others of their generation, black women actively sought organizations that challenged gender stereotypes in the larger society. And because many of these women were committed to eradicating racist as well as sexist attitudes, some found what they were looking for in the Panthers.\\n\\n“I would say that the women who were drawn to the Black Panther Party were all feminists,” said Ericka Huggins, the widow of the slain Panther leader John Huggins and the first woman to open a Black Panther Party chapter, in New Haven, where she served as deputy chairwoman. She went on to clarify in a phone interview: “Not in the way that feminism is looked at today, in which you have to go step by step in order to claim yourself as a feminist. But we generally believed in the political, social, economic and sexual equality of women and girls.”\\n\\nIn her forthcoming book, “What You’ve Got Is a Revolution,” the historian Ashley Farmer describes how Panther women would go on to shape the internal and sometimes internecine debates about gender equality and racial militancy in their women’s groups, in the Panther newspaper and elsewhere. At the same time, they often led and sustained the organization’s most successful community programs — the Free Breakfast for School Children Program, the Liberation Schools and the People’s Free Medical Centers — long past the Panthers’ prime.\\n\\n“I think the hidden discussions within the party were about what it meant to be a new black man and new black woman, and that eventually led to new narratives about gender roles,” said Tracye Matthews, the associate director of the Center for the Study of Race, Politics and Culture at the University of Chicago.\\n\\nWhat was progressive about the Panthers’ practices of equality — like having men cook in the breakfast programs and arming women to fight — also fostered tension. “They were constantly forced to confront how their theory of equality played out in real life and in the context of real oppression,” Ms. Matthews concluded.\\n\\nOne of the most outspoken critics of sexism within the Black Panther Party (and of Mr. Nelson’s film, for that matter) may be Elaine Brown, who was also the only woman to lead the organization (from 1974 to 1977). She wrote about the gender contradictions extensively in her 1992 memoir, “A Taste of Power,” but, in the film she acknowledges that challenging Panther male chauvinism was not always successful. “Did we overcome it? Of course we didn’t. Or as I like to say, ‘We didn’t get these brothers from revolutionary heaven.’ ”\\n\\nIt might have been state, not divine, intervention that created the political vacuum that allowed women to rise to positions of power in the party. In 1969, when national and local law enforcement officials unleashed their strongest and most violent attacks against the Panther leadership, they primarily targeted men.\\n\\n“I don’t think that the police in San Francisco and Oakland took women that seriously as leaders because of their own chauvinism,” said Kathleen Cleaver, the Panthers’ first communications secretary and the former wife of Eldridge Cleaver. As a result, “many of the men in the party ended up being arrested, going into exile or underground, or dead.”\\n\\nIn response to this void, the Panthers’ fluctuating gender philosophy became strategic practice as the organization relied on those who remained: the women who continued to steer the party and its community programs.\\n\\nWhile many pop-culture depictions of the party, like Mario Van Peebles’s 1995 film “Panther,” have paid “scant attention to the heroic contributions of female Panthers,” as Michael Eric Dyson’s review noted at the time, one other film stands out. In Tanya Hamilton’s 2010 film “Night Catches Us,” the heroine is Patricia Wilson (Kerry Washington), an ex-Panther turned defense lawyer whose husband was brutally murdered in a standoff with the Philadelphia police. Ms. Hamilton said in a phone interview that she made Patricia the heroine because “she had an obligation to the movement, and not just to the exciting or radical parts, but the functioning parts: feeding kids, making sure they stayed in school and protecting the neighborhood.”\\n\\nShe continued: “And for Pat, that protection went far beyond the role of being a Huey Newton standing on the corner to having her house be a central place for people who needed things. I envisioned her as a remnant of the most beautiful part of the Panthers.”\\n\\n\\xadSalamishah Tillet is an associate professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of “Sites of Slavery: Citizenship and Racial Democracy in the Post-Civil Rights Imagination.” She is writing a book about Nina Simone.\\n\\nA version of this article appears in print on October 4, 2015, on page AR12 of the New York edition with the headline: The Panthers’ Revolutionary Feminism.

       "  'text': \"Twenty-five years after “The Heidi Chronicles” closed on Broadway, believers in the work of Wendy Wasserstein seized an opening. In the era of “Lean In” and “Girls,” and a paucity of female voices on Broadway, they would revive Ms. Wasserstein’s most acclaimed play, “The Heidi Chronicles,” with a beloved television star, Elisabeth Moss, in the title role.\\n\\nThe show opened to strong reviews, even from critics who had expressed hesitation about whether a story borne out of gender debates in the 1980s would still be relevant today. But the play consistently failed to draw audiences, and on Tuesday night the producers announced that it would close on May 3 after just 80 performances — raising questions about Ms. Wasserstein’s legacy and her place in contemporary feminist discussion.\\n\\nLena Dunham raved about the revival on Twitter, calling it “a totally gorgeous show” and saying that Ms. Wasserstein had “greatly” inspired her own TV series, “Girls.” But the lively world of online feminism that regular buzzes with discussions of “Girls” — or “Mad Men,” which stars Ms. Moss as the protofeminist Peggy Olson — has taken little notice of the show (and pays little attention to theater in general).\\n\\n“It represents a moment in feminism that has passed,” said Jill Dolan, a Princeton University theater professor who is writing a critical study of Ms. Wasserstein’s work. “The question ‘Can we have it all?’ is just not the main question that American feminism is asking right now.”\\n\\nChloe Angyal, a columnist for feministing.com with a Ph.D. in media studies, said that Ms. Wasserstein still held symbolic importance, but that she didn’t know the play and had only read about it in reviews. She saw it as a reflection of a privileged, upper-middle-class, second-wave feminism that the younger feminists of today want to distance themselves from, while still acknowledging their indebtedness.\\n\\n“There is a very strong ‘not your mother’s feminism’ bent among young activists and writers and journalists I know today,” she said. “We are working really hard to decenter feminism from the world of Manhattan-dwelling, Broadway-going feminists. Not that their problems aren’t real. But they are not representative of a majority of people who need feminism today.”\\n\\nThe closing is a disappointment for Ms. Wasserstein’s champions, who have worked hard to promote her work since she died in 2006 at 55. But in interviews on Wednesday, they argued that the show’s fortunes said more about the Broadway audience than it did about the long-term significance of Ms. Wasserstein’s work.\\n\\n“The Heidi Chronicles” drew praise, both when it was first staged and again this year, for its depiction of the struggles that women face balancing careers and families. It won the Tony Award for best play and the Pulitzer Prize for drama in 1989 and has been widely produced in other cities since then.\\n\\n“Wendy Wasserstein’s plays continue to be produced all over the country and in Canada,” said Peter Hagan, the president of Dramatists Play Service Inc. “She is a playwright who continues to be produced.”\\n\\nThe revival, directed by Pam MacKinnon, stars Ms. Moss as an art historian, Heidi Holland, and Jason Biggs (“Orange Is the New Black”) and Bryce Pinkham (“A Gentleman’s Guide to Love and Murder”) as longtime friends. Producers lost the entire capitalization, which was between $3.5 million and $4 million. The play had grossed $2,565,125 as of Sunday, according to the Broadway League; last week, it played to half-empty theaters and grossed $311,933.\\n\\nBoth the play and the current production have their critics. “There’s something that rings false about a piece like this — despite its neat ending, we know what happens next in the real world, and for most women it is not all lullabies and new houses,” said Holly L. Derr, a feminist media critic and artist-in-residence at Skidmore College.\\n\\nMs. Dolan of Princeton, who saw the play during its original run, said she had come around to “Heidi” after initially being enraged by it.\\n\\n“I teach it as a history play,” she said.\\n\\nVictoria Myers, a co-founder of The Interval, a website about women and theater, called “Heidi” “a hugely important play,” and said, “I definitely still think it’s relevant.” However, she said that younger people may not “understand the significance of the play, or even of Wendy Wasserstein and the barriers she broke. Those facts haven’t been adequately highlighted by the theater community.”\\n\\nSeveral playwrights involved in the continuing struggle to see more productions of plays by women said it was unfair to ask about the implications of a Broadway failure.\\n\\n“I’ve reread a number of Wendy’s plays in the past year or so, and they’re beautifully written plays filled with fresh, human insight,” said Lisa Kron, who wrote the book for the new musical “Fun Home.” “I can’t imagine that the life span of one production, particularly on Broadway, which is famously and universally treacherous to begin with, means anything about Wasserstein particularly. Does this question get asked when a Mamet play closes?”\\n\\nAnd Theresa Rebeck, the author of “Seminar” and “Dead Accounts,” both on Broadway in recent seasons, said the attention to the popular reception of “Heidi” was a reminder of how rare it is to see a Broadway play by a woman.\\n\\n“Every year it’s a terrible statistic — there should be more female voices, and then we wouldn’t all be obsessing on Wendy Wasserstein’s voice,” she said. “Wendy was writing at a time when she occupied a very essential place, naming the issues that were rising around feminism and women and culture, and since then the situation has gotten logarithmically more complicated.”\\n\\nAndré Bishop, the artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater and one of Ms. Wasserstein’s literary executors, disputed the idea that the short Broadway run diminished Ms. Wasserstein’s stature. “If anything,” he said, “it enhanced her reputation and introduced her to a whole new generation of people who didn’t really know her.”\\n\\n“For any good writer, their work goes through phases of acceptance and falling away and coming back — that’s part of the road all writers take, especially when they’re no longer alive,” Mr. Bishop added. “The sadness about Wendy is that she had a lot more plays in her, and the fact that she never lived to write them.”\\n\\nCorrection: April 22, 2015 An earlier version of this article misidentified the organization for which Peter Hagan is president. It is Dramatists Play Service Inc., not Dramatists Guild. (Dramatists Guild founded Dramatists Play Service Inc., but they have different presidents.)\\n\\nA version of this article appears in print on April 23, 2015, on page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: Questions of Feminism and Legacy Trail a Play.

       "  'text': 'KARACHI, Pakistan — On Feb. 12, 1983, 200 women — activists and lawyers — marched to the Lahore High Court to petition against a law that would have made a man’s testimony in court worth that of two women. The Pakistani dictator Gen. Muhammad Zia ul-Haq had already promulgated the infamous Hudood Ordinance, which reflected his extremist vision of Islam and Islamic law. Now, it was clear to many Pakistani women that the military regime was manipulating Islam to rob them of their rights.\\n\\nGeneral Zia’s days are over, and parts of the Hudood laws pertaining to rape and adultery have been superseded by less objectionable clauses in Pakistan’s Protection of Women Act of 2006. But Pakistani women have yet to achieve what Madihah Akhter, writing in The Feminist Wire, an online magazine, identifies as “political, cultural and economic equality for women and a place in the constant struggle to define their nation.”\\n\\nThe reality of Pakistan’s women continues to confound easy categorization. They have been going to school and university, holding down jobs and earning money for several generations now. Yet they still live with widespread gender-based violence, society’s acceptance of women as property, and a widespread belief that they don’t deserve education, jobs or an existence outside the domestic sphere.\\n\\nNeither Pakistan’s laws nor its social codes nor its religious mores truly guarantee women a secure place as citizens equal to men; such attitudes are preserved by patriarchal tribal and cultural traditions, as well as the continued twisting of Islamic injunctions to suit the needs of misogynists. Could feminism be the best antidote to this male chauvinism ingrained in modern Pakistani society?\\n\\nFeminism has been alive in Pakistan since the country was born. During partition of the British Indian Empire in 1947, a Women’s Relief Committee, which oversaw refugee transfers between India and Pakistan, was founded by Fatima Jinnah, the sister of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Pakistan’s founding father. Then Begum Ra’ana Liaqat Ali, the wife of Pakistan’s first prime minister, founded the All-Pakistan Women’s Association in 1949; that organization worked for the moral, social and economic welfare of Pakistani women. Ms. Jinnah ran in the presidential elections in 1965 and was even supported by orthodox religious parties, but lost to the dictator then holding the office, Gen. Ayub Khan.\\n\\nIn the 1980s, the Women’s Action Forum used activism to oppose General Zia’s myopic vision of Islam; today, Pakistani feminist collectives continue to protest violence against women, raise awareness about women’s education and political and legal rights, and lobby policy makers to enact women-friendly laws. The groundbreaking Repeal of Hudood Ordinance, the women’s empowerment bill and anti-honor-killings bill were all moved in Parliament when Sherry Rehman, a former ambassador to the United States and a renowned feminist, held the portfolio of minister for women’s development in the last decade. These and the anti-sexual-harassment bill were all eventually codified in Pakistani law over the next several years.\\n\\nBut many Pakistanis cling to the idea that feminism is not relevant to Pakistan — that it’s the preserve of the rich and idle or, worse, that it’s a Western imposition meant to wreak havoc on Pakistani society. Many Pakistani men and women believe that women’s rights need go no further than improvements Islam brought to the status of women in tribal Arabia in the seventh century. Men in Pakistan are not yet ready to give up their male privilege, and many Pakistani women, not wanting to rock the boat, agree with them. The Pakistani historian Ayesha Jalal calls it the “convenience of subservience” when elite and upper-class women marginalize women’s movements in order to maintain their own privilege.\\n\\nThe scholar Margot Badran has identified two threads of feminism in the Muslim world: 19th-century “secular feminism” and 20th-century “Islamic feminism.” Islamic feminism, pioneered by scholars like Riffat Hassan, Amina Wadud, Asma Barlas and Fatema Mernissi, seeks to reclaim Islam from male interpretations by using passages in the Quran to combat institutional misogyny. Islamic feminism as practiced in Pakistan is accessible to the middle and upper middle classes, who enthusiastically attend Quran classes held in Urdu, where they analyze verses and learn about the rights that the religion affords them. It also inculcates solidarity with Muslim women around the world. But with its emphasis on academic learning, it can limit empowerment to educated women, marginalizing the unschooled and the poor.\\n\\nPakistani feminists like Shahnaz Rouse, a Sarah Lawrence College professor, and Farida Shaheed, a sociologist who heads the Shirkat Gah women’s resource center in Pakistan, have done vital work in the field of Pakistani gender identity and class analysis, while Fouzia Saeed has been instrumental in raising the issue of sexual harassment. But their work, and that of other theorists and activists whose primary basis for feminism is not Islam, is often dismissed as favored only by an English-speaking elite with little relevance to greater Pakistani society.\\n\\nYet secular feminism has a more democratic scope; its proponents agitate for the rights of all women in Pakistan, non-Muslim as well as Muslim. It links to other feminist movements worldwide, not just Islamic ones, and is more pluralistic. By appealing to secular nationalism as well as Islamic modernism, it is not restrained by the need to base all thought in Islamic scripture, although secular feminists also use this powerful tool when necessary.\\n\\nA feminist movement can succeed only when it mirrors the makeup of the women and the society for whom it operates. Pakistan needs a feminism that elegantly marries both strands of feminism — secular and Islamic — because that’s how Pakistan was formed: on both Islamic and secular principles.\\n\\nThe clinical psychologist Rubeena Kidwai said this about the status of women in Pakistan today: “Pakistani women are like bonsai trees, clipped and pruned and weighed down by the expectations of Pakistani society.” And Pakistan’s feminists are the only ones who can undo that destructive process, so that Pakistani women can flourish and grow to the heights of their human potential.\\n\\nBina Shah is the author of several novels, including “Slum Child,” and short-story collections.',\n",

       "  'text': 'PARIS — Does it make a difference to have a female designer at the top of a major couture house?\\n\\nThis was the inevitable question surrounding the debut of Maria Grazia Chiuri, the first woman to be named creative director of Christian Dior in the company’s 70-year history.\\n\\nSymbolically, of course, the answer is, “absolutely”: There is something bizarrely retrograde about the fact that a business based on catering to women never had a woman running it. And given that this year may see an unprecedented number of women at the head of major geopolitical powers, it was about time.\\n\\nThis has not escaped Ms. Chiuri, who has both a son and a daughter, and who said one of her primary considerations in taking on the Dior job was the ability to show the next generation that it had “the same opportunities,” no matter what gender.\\n\\nSo in preparation for her first show, she read not only Dior’s classic memoir but also “Women Who Run With the Wolves,” the late-20th-century classic of pop psychology and anthropology about the wild woman in us all.\\n\\nAnd then she invited, as guest of honor, the Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, whose 2013 TedX talk, “We Should All be Feminists,” went viral when it was sampled for the Beyoncé anthem “Flawless.” Ms. Adichie sat in the front row next to the usual celebrity crew — Diane Kruger, Marion Cotillard, Rihanna, Bianca Jagger — and her presence was as much a statement of change as the white box in the garden of the Musée Rodin that had been stripped to its simple essence, with pine blocks as benches and pine boards for a runway.\\n\\nTo better to showcase. … what?\\n\\nPure white, in cotton, sometimes quilted, atop trousers cropped knickerbocker-short and frilled tulle petticoats. (Well, what woman doesn’t have to thrust and parry now and then? Or what man, for that matter?) Also glimmering tulle ballet skirts under T-shirts flashing the title of Ms. Adichie’s speech, or the slogan “Dio(r)evolution.” Which pretty much summed up the point.\\n\\nMs. Chiuri was taking all the elements that were already in the house, and doing it her way.\\n\\nIndeed, unlike any Dior artistic director who had come before her, Ms. Chiuri acknowledged the entire history of the brand, from Mr. Dior’s bar jacket, here shrunken down and remade in cotton with pockets just over the hips to add a bit of curve, to John Galliano’s “J’adore Dior” period, remade as “J’ADIOR” on the waistbands of underpants visible beneath the tulle, and on straps of camisoles under bustiers. She even referred to Hedi Slimane’s stint at Dior Homme, adopting his stitch signature for boyfriend jeans.\\n\\nOh, and there were classic trench coats and “Kill Bill” leather motorcycle jackets in there, too. It all culminated in a series of sheer spaghetti-strap gowns embroidered in the signs and stars of the zodiac and tarot. In a preview, Ms. Chiuri said they were a nod to Dior’s own love of tarot, but in practice they most called to mind her own work in her previous job as co-designer of Valentino.\\n\\nAll of which is to say there was a lot on the runway, a lot of which will be accessible to many people. “I believe fashion should not impose itself on the person who wears it, but be used by them as a way to express themselves,” Ms. Chiuri said the day before the show, so she gave them lots of choices. Fair enough.\\n\\nIf they were united by anything, however, it was the desire to use an épée tip to puncture some of the pomposity attached to a heritage house, as opposed to a statement on what defines a woman now.

       "  'title': 'Gloria Steinem Brings Feminism to Vice TV',\n",
       "  'date': '2016050519',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington — Gloria Steinem and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. were engrossed in conversation steps from his ceremonial office, where he was getting his makeup done. Ms. Steinem, already prepped, was here to interview him for “Woman,” her new Vice TV show.\\n\\nShe skipped past notes her producers had readied about their topic, “It’s on Us,” the White House’s pledge initiative against sexual assault, and led with her own question: What motivated him to take on this cause? She pressed him on gender-related problems in the military — “the culture is changing,” he said, in part because of advocates like her. A photo of “Joe and Glo” was snapped for her new Instagram account.\\n\\nAfter the vice president strode away, young White House staffers stepped in to angle for their own selfies. Seen-it-all aides went rapt as Ms. Steinem recounted her experience as a 17-year-old in Washington (“We made it a project to swim in all the fountains”), the first president she remembers (Franklin D. Roosevelt) and the times she picketed outside the Capitol (numerous).\\n\\nWhile Ms. Steinem, 82, has clocked a half-century as an activist, journalist and feminist leader, “Woman” is the first time she has produced and hosted a TV series. Beginning on Tuesday, it will run on the new cable channel Viceland, exploring in 10 weekly episodes human rights and violence against women around the world, from child marriage in Zambia to sexual attacks in the United States military. It is not an easy watch, but Ms. Steinem was adamant that it would present a complex portrait of its subjects, as survivors and advocates, and offer viewers a way to become involved.\\n\\n“What I hope is, seeing it will be the closest thing to being on the ground yourself,” she said. “It is being a witness. And people in hard times need a witness, and somebody who can help.”\\n\\nIn her focus on first-person accounts and D.I.Y. support systems, Ms. Steinem is aligned with the interests of millennial audiences — the kind that Vice, in their unlikely partnership, hopes to deliver. What that demographic, newly awoken to her legacy, might not realize is how well Ms. Steinem — a social networker even before she joined Twitter; a nondriver; a voracious traveler who has spent most of her career without a formal job; and a lifelong rule-breaker who can rock a raised fist and a raunchy punch line — fits in with them already.\\n\\n“I think she’s a hero,” said Shane Smith, a founder of Vice who greenlit the show.\\n\\nThe two met at a Google conference in 2014, where she talked about the global upsurge in violence against women “and the fact that it was now extreme enough so that there are fewer females on earth than males,” she recalled.\\n\\nMr. Smith was listening. “She gave a speech and then I bawled my eyes out,” he said. “I was blown away” by her storytelling and the wealth of her experience. Given her connections and insight, he added, “I realized she was a natural producer.”\\n\\nBut their collaboration was hardly an obvious match: Vice made its name on bro-centric content, heavy on the danger-zone posturing, gross-out humor and dopey stoner antics. (Even its nerdiest cable show is called “Balls Deep.”) And as the brand’s poster boy, Mr. Smith, a major onscreen presence in Vice’s separate HBO show, has reveled in a cussing, anti-authoritarian persona even as he became a vaunted, and wealthy, chief executive.\\n\\nMs. Steinem knew of Vice’s “very masculine reputation,” as she put it. So before she committed to the series, which began development in October 2014, she sniffed around for any trouble and emerged at ease. “It felt to me like an organization that had started one way and was becoming much more universal,” she said in an interview in Vice’s clubby offices in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. “What it reminded me of was New York magazine,” where she landed early in her career in the 1960s. “That was totally male — Jimmy Breslin and Tom Wolfe, and all these writers. And that also was open to change.” (A subsidy from New York’s editor Clay Felker enabled Ms. Steinem and others to start Ms. Magazine in 1971.)\\n\\nIt helped that the team for “Woman” was almost entirely female, led by a group of female producers, among them Ariel Wengroff, a 26-year-old with a background in politics. Before she landed at Vice two years ago, Ms. Wengroff had never worked on, let alone created, a TV show.\\n\\nIt was a “complete leap of faith,” she said of working on “Woman,” which she and Mr. Smith developed with the Vice News producer Iris Xu, Ms. Steinem and her longtime associate Amy Richards. From the crew up, it is the most heavily female-staffed program in Viceland’s lineup. (The company also began Broadly, an online channel oriented toward women, in 2015.)\\n\\nMs. Steinem has other TV credits and talk show offers were dangled over the years, but they required too much time, she said, and she wasn’t keen on network oversight. “Vice feels much more able to move quickly,” she said.\\n\\nBack in New York, she invited some compatriots to the Soho House for a first feedback screening: leaders from the Ford Foundation and Equality Now, along with Leymah Gbowee, the Liberian Nobel Peace Prize winner. They watched the series’ wrenching premiere about rape as a tool of war in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\\n\\nEpisodes begin and end with Ms. Steinem speaking to the camera about the challenges facing women, but the bulk of the reporting is handled by young international correspondents, chosen by Vice, who straddle the line between journalist and activist, as Ms. Steinem does. They shot in eight countries; an episode in Pakistan, directed by Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, this year’s Oscar winner for documentary short, is still in progress.\\n\\nMs. Steinem did not travel with them, but her expertise paved the way. “Gloria brought a whole different level of credibility and access to women on the ground that we wouldn’t have had otherwise,” Ms. Wengroff said, suggesting “where we could and couldn’t go, who she felt was credible and who she’s worked with, and who also is new that we could empower.”\\n\\nThe host of the debut episode, Isobel Yeung, journeys along bumpy roads to meet a warlord, and is barred from an interview despite having arranged for access — a marker of authenticity in this documentary style. She is also visibly distraught by the horrors her subjects reveal. In typical Vice fashion, the camera cuts back often to capture correspondents’ reactions, their tears and outrage. Ms. Steinem loved this intimate take: an emotional entry point.\\n\\nAfter the screening, the audience swapped resources. Ms. Steinem wanted more footage online of women sharing their survival stories. “We have to figure out how strong they are, and how to leave hope,” she said. “The challenge is to know, and not despair, and figure out how to make it better a little bit at a time.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'When historians set out to date the moment when the women’s movement of the 1970s officially consolidated its gains, they could do worse than settle on last Tuesday’s primaries.\\n\\nIt was a day when most of the major races featured female candidates, and all the major female candidates won. They won in South Dakota and Arkansas, California and Nevada. They won as business-friendly moderates (the Golden State’s Meg Whitman); as embattled incumbents (Arkansas’s Blanche Lincoln); as Tea Party insurgents (Sharron Angle in Nevada). South Carolina gubernatorial hopeful Nikki Haley even came in first despite multiple allegations of adultery.\\n\\nBut mostly, they won as Republicans. Conservative Republicans, in fact. Conservative Republicans endorsed by Sarah Palin, in many cases. Which generated a certain amount of angst in the liberal commentariat about What It All Meant For Feminism.\\n\\n“Do you still cheer,” Slate’s Sara Libby wondered of Whitman’s and Carly Fiorina’s California victories, “if the [glass] ceiling is crashed by two conservative businesswomen?” On “Good Morning America,” Tina Brown fretted that “it almost feels as if all these women winning are kind of a blow to feminism.” Writing in The Daily Beast, Linda Hirshman declared that support for abortion rights and Obamacare were litmus tests for true feminism, as opposed to the “selfish” variety that triumphed on Tuesday.\\n\\nThese conflicted responses echoed a similar debate that broke out a few weeks earlier, following a Palin speech in which she repeatedly laid claim to the feminist mantle — praising the “mama grizzlies” currently running for office as conservative Republicans, and hailing an “emerging, conservative, feminist identity.” Half the women in journalism, it seemed, weighed in on the address, with reactions ranging from “you’ve got to be [expletive] kidding me” on the Web site Jezebel to Meghan Daum’s declaration in The Los Angeles Times that if Palin “has the guts to call herself a feminist, then she’s entitled to be accepted as one.”\\n\\nThe question of whether conservative women get to be feminists is an interesting and important one. But it has obscured a deeper truth: Whether or not Palin or Fiorina or Haley can legitimately claim the label feminist, their rise is a testament to the overall triumph of the women’s movement.\\n\\nWhat Tuesday’s results demonstrated, convincingly, is that America is now a country where social conservatives are as comfortable as liberals with the idea of women in high office. More strikingly, they’re comfortable voting for working mothers — for women publicly juggling careers and family obligations in ways that would have been unthinkable for the generations of female leaders, from Elizabeth I’s Virgin Queen down to Margaret Thatcher’s Iron Lady, who were expected to unsex themselves before being entrusted with the responsibilities of state.\\n\\nThis is a remarkable sea change. It’s been less than two decades since 1992 — dubbed the Year of the Woman because a slew of female Democrats won Senate seats, but also a year when much of conservative America viscerally recoiled from Hillary Clinton’s career-woman persona. Now Clinton has become many conservatives’ favorite liberal, and Republicans are fielding a crop of female candidates that includes working moms like Haley (who has two kids under 13), Kristi Noem (a 38-year-old mother of three running for South Dakota’s House seat) and Kelly Ayotte (the front-runner in the New Hampshire Senate primary, who has a 5-year-old and a 2-year-old).\\n\\nYes, female public servants still face a thicket of sex-specific challenges while running for office. (Fiorina walked into one last week, when a live microphone caught her making fun of the hairstyle of her general-election opponent, Barbara Boxer.) But these challenges no longer manifest themselves in predictable ways, as the peculiar left-wing misogyny that greeted Palin’s candidacy emphatically demonstrated. And the models for feminine success in the political arena, from the Tea Party’s Angle to Harvard Law’s Elena Kagan, look almost as diverse as American women themselves.\\n\\nIn this environment, it isn’t a surprise that women in the public square now disagree about everything from abortion to health care to foreign policy. If anything, it’s a sign that feminism may be returning to its fractious, ideologically unpredictable roots. (As Kerry Howley noted recently, reviewing a history of late-Victorian female radicals, there was no such thing as a “typical” early feminist: “She might well support free love but think condoms a tool of the sex-mad patriarchy; she might want to socialize housework or smash the state.”)\\n\\nSo however much heartburn Palin’s “mama grizzlies” give to those who associate feminism with the policies and prejudices of American liberalism, circa 1973, they should recognize their emergence for what it is: not a setback for the women’s movement, but a happy consequence of its victories.',\n",

Quote:\\n\\nLionel Tiger, a professor of anthropology at Rutgers University, said the field takes its cues “from the notion that male and female organisms really are different” and the “enormous relation between … a person’s biology and their behavior” that’s not being addressed in most contemporary scholarship on men and boys.\\n\\n“I am concerned that male-averse attitudes are widespread in the United States and that masculinity is becoming politically incorrect,” said Christina Hoff Sommers, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and author of “The War Against Boys: How Misguided Feminism Is Harming Our Young Men.”\\n\\nThe culprit, said Dr. Tiger, is feminism: “a well-meaning, highly successful, very colorful denigration of maleness as a force, as a phenomenon.”\\n\\nBut Robert Heasley, president of the nearly two-decade-old American Men’s Studies Association, who steered clear of the event, said the “new” discipline isn’t really new: “Their argument is that they’re inventing something that I think already exists.”\\n\\n“It’s kind of a Glenn Beck approach,” he added.\\n\\nLet the fun begin.

Feminism is back on the rise, and it’s all thanks to the internet. Social media lets women share their experiences faster and wider than ever, and that is fuelling a new, highly personal mass movement.\\n\\nTake the ultra-successful Everyday Sexism project, which retweets women’s nasty experiences at the hands of sweaty human octopi. It really is grim reading. They’ve got 90,000 followers on Twitter, although their reach goes way further. Here’s a random example: “I had a stranger slide their hand up between my legs while I was ordering drinks at a bar.” If that happened 18 months ago, the victim would suffer alone. Now she can reach an audience equal to Nuts and Zoo magazines’ readerships combined.\\n\\nGiven we’re talking about a mix of social media and radical politics, things are inevitably moving fastest among students. In the last year, feminist societies have popped up at universities everywhere, including Durham, Liverpool and Kings College London. When I was at university four years ago, we published a reprehensible Page 3 feature on our tabloid website called Tab Totty. We had a Cambridge student posing awkwardly on a punt wearing a pink bikini and the kind of Perspex heels that David Cameron wants to make you opt-in to see. It's offline now, sorry. The shoot attracted the wrath of about three angry feminists.\\n\\nIf someone brought out Tab Totty today, they would be abused in lectures, and their inboxes and message feeds would overflow with messages from people they will never meet telling them just how “vile” (the angry adjective du jour) they are. If you upset a feminist now, you better be prepared for abuse from a hundred others.\\n\\nEarlier this year, a campaign where students were photographed holding placards explaining “why I need feminism” was posted endlessly on Facebook. It’s simple, picture-based storytelling, and marketing professionals are already using it as a case study. In a world without Facebook, that idea would live and die in a few radical magazines. Now, it gets shared and imitated round the world.\\n\\nThe fit is obvious – social media is all about sharing your personal experience. And so too is this contemporary brand of feminism. It’s an aggregation of nasty experiences, annoyances and personal justifications. That stuff might be seriously individualistic, but it’s something everyone can get on board with. In fact, it is a method of political symbolism normally better used by the Right: people, stories and faces, that’s the stuff that arouses human emotion, not tiresome theoretical constructions.\\n\\nThe new feminism is hardly the March on Washington, but it is the only political movement – Jihadists aside – using the Internet effectively. Today’s feminists have a formula politicians and marketers crave: how to harness technology and individualism to build a mass movement people actually care about.\\n\\nSo get used to hearing about the patriarchy, because the online surge is going to mean more feminists everywhere: in the workplace, on the TV, perhaps even in your living room.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'In the lead-up to 2016, Republicans are going to have to perform some serious magic with female voters. They’ll have to make all those pesky rape comments disappear, use sleight-of hand to distract us from their idiotic beliefs about women’s biology and the fact that the core of their platform is about maintaining inequality.\\n\\nBut the GOP’s real abracadabra moment will come if they pull off the trick they’ve been working on for years: convincing Americans that Republicans are not only good for women, but actual feminists.\\n\\nLast week, presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina was anointed a “real feminist” by The Week, even though “she has no use for laws mandating ‘equal pay’ or paid maternity leave or contraceptive coverage.” In Jeb Bush’s Liberty University commencement speech over the weekend, the likely Republican presidential candidate told his audience that “wherever there is a child waiting to be born, we say choose life,” and in the same breath added, without irony, that he derided the “arrogance” of treating women and girls “as possessions without rights and dignity.”\\n\\nAnd next month, the Independent Women’s Forum - a powerful conservative women’s group based in DC - is hosting a “Women Lead” summit to “move forward with a positive agenda for women.” The speakers include Christina Hoff Sommers (who has defended the misogynist horde known as GamerGate), Naomi Schaefer Riley (who wrote that a woman who was raped and murdered “should have known better” than to be at a bar alone), and Katie Pavlich (who says feminists oppose guns because “modern feminism can’t survive without victims” and the movement would rather see women raped than armed). These are the women, we’re told, who will “discuss the progressive women’s landscape.”\\n\\nBut glomming on to the cultural cache of feminism is a losing strategy for Republicans - and has been for years. In 2008, when the Wall Street Journal coined the term “Sarah Palin Feminism”, Republicans cynically believed that any woman on the ticket - no matter what she believed - would bring in women’s votes. (It didn’t.) And as feminism’s influence and power has grown over the last decade, conservative women who eschewed feminist ideals for years have started to call themselves the real feminists.\\n\\nBut try as they might, Republicans will not be able to extricate themselves from their anti-choice, anti-birth control positions or convince female voters that said beliefs are actually in line with what’s best for women. We know that’s not true.\\n\\nAs Naral Pro-Choice America president Ilyse Hogue told me over email, Americans are “embracing the fact that women are the bellweather of economic well-being for the family unit, reproductive freedom and abortion rights are critical to economic opportunity and job security, and that women’s rights are human rights.”\\n\\nRepublicans won’t be able to run away from women’s bodies and rights this time - no matter how many times they use the word ‘feminist’ or ‘empowerment’. Because feminism isn’t just a label that anyone can slap on themselves when it’s politically convenient. It’s an actual movement, with actual people behind it - people who aren’t willing to let their hard work be co-opted by those who want to see women’s rights rolled back while telling us its progress.\\n\\nThere aren’t enough smoke and mirrors in the world for that trick to work.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Here’s the thing about feminism: whether or not we subscribe to it, we benefit from it every day.\\n\\nI was born decades after suffragettes fought for my right to vote and the first wave of feminists faced jeers for wanting equality both at home and in the workplace. I’ve benefited from those women and their brazen belief in what many younger women now take for granted.\\n\\nI’m not sure that there’s ever been an easy time to be a woman in business, but I do know it’s worthwhile to be one. It means freedom, calling the shots, having my own money to spend, making my own decisions. These are feminist concepts, whether you accept the label or not.\\n\\nI personally reject the notion of any single definition of the word feminism. I think about brands every day. I’ve launched tech companies, taught personal branding on the graduate level and rebranded disgraced politicians.\\n\\nBut I’m stumped in trying to figure out how to rebrand feminism for the Tumblr and Snapchat generation.While some young women obsess about their pursuit of the elusive thigh gap, they seem far less concerned with the glaring wage gap. They’re taught whether they can call themselves bossy, but what they aren’t taught are basic rules for earning or managing money – and by extension their own lives.\\n\\nIn college I remember arguing with a professor that Madonna was more capitalist than feminist. I’d make a similar argument about performers like Lady Gaga and Beyoncé, who are businesswomen above all, with powerhouse brands. You can argue whether they represent feminine strength or a willingness to bare body and soul to get rich. But at least they have the option – of baring and of getting rich – which wasn’t always the case for a woman.\\n\\nWe forget the freedom – the options – we have. We can work, and we can make our own money. This is a big cultural change from even our grandmothers’ generation. I was raised in a traditional observant Jewish family, but I had the luxury of growing up gender-blind – with a supportive father who didn’t talk about feminism but did push my older sister to become the first woman in our family to graduate from college.\\n\\nFinancial autonomy was in my blood. Earning my own money meant I could spend as I saw fit. When people ask about my first job, I joke that I started working at the age of two, when my mother opened her first store, a crafts shop in Brooklyn. I was always at the counter. I graduated to other jobs: babysitting, teaching art at the local Y, selling handmade accessories to friends.\\n\\nI was in for a rude awakening at my first real job, where I spent the first few months known as “the girl”, instructed in the subtleties of making coffee for the C suite.\\n\\nMy career grew, but slowly: I hated waiting for someone else’s permission to advance, to learn, to grow.\\n\\nTraditional corporate life taught me one indelible lesson. In that playing field, gender almost always trumped smarts or talent; both of those faded when confronted with the right family name or collegiate connections – neither of which I had. Cubicle life proved to be an uncomfortable fit and I eventually went on to form several companies of my own.\\n\\nAs the child of immigrants, I was raised to believe that working hard was a virtue and being given things a foreign ideal. As my world expanded, so did the sexism I saw around me: people eager to embrace tired sexist tropes or minimize the accomplishments that my female friends and I worked hard for.\\n\\nToday’s feminist icons may not burn their bras or say you don’t need a man. They inhabit different forms and career paths, but they all serve a specific role – educating and empowering the next generation of both women and men, expanding our shared possibilities. Role models come in all shapes and sizes. Some are businesswomen. Some are also mothers. Some rely on sequins and tattoos and redefining what’s mainstream.\\n\\nThey are all feminists, however, because they are all women who like to speak for themselves. In the end, that’s the definition of a feminist I like best.',\n",

       "  'text': 'An old canard about feminists is that, in addition to being hirsute bra-burners, we want to turn all women into “victims” – and thanks to “Women Against Feminism”, this particular accusation has gained some moderately mainstream traction in recent weeks.\\n\\nBut feminism doesn’t make women victims. Sexism does.\\n\\nThat inconvenient truth hasn’t stopped conservatives and anti-feminists from using this supposed victimization to bash a movement that won women the rights to vote, have credit cards, not be legally raped by their husbands, use birth control and generally be considered people instead of property, among other things.\\n\\nAdmittedly, to those unfamiliar with stereotypes of the women’s movement, the #WomenAgainstFeminism meme may look more like a parody than anything of serious concern. Many of its participants show a baffling level of ignorance about what feminism actually is – signs reading “I don’t need feminism because my boyfriend treats me right” or “I like men looking at me” are cringe-inducing, for instance. And I’m skeptical of how many new “women’s” Twitter accounts suddenly popped up in the days surrounding the meme’s creation.\\n\\nBut all the cringing and skepticism in the world hasn’t stopped the idea of “Women Against Feminism” from being taken seriously by at least some in the media.\\n\\nThe BBC kicked off a conversation about the “movement” by asking, “Has feminism become unnecessary and irrelevant?” The expected conservative hacks have come out, with the National Review Online bashing the “hostile” feminist responses and Rush Limbaugh saying “pictures of these babes” are “really, really great to see”. And Cathy Young wrote at Time about the multiple disavowals of feminism that cited “I am not a victim” and called the characterization of the movement as victimizing a “fair description”.\\n\\nBut denying that women are a victimized class is simply wrong. What else would you call a segment of the population who are systematically discriminated against in school, work and politics? How would you describe a population whose bodies are objectified to the point of dehumanization? Women are harassed, attacked and sexually assaulted with alarming regularity in America and around the world, and now even more of them live in states where, if pregnant, they can be refused medical attention or arrested for refusing C-sections.\\n\\nPeople who are on the shit end of oppression are oppressed. Accurately describing this is not a matter of politics, but of truth.\\n\\nBut because we live in a culture that values independence and strength and negates the agency of victims – wrongly conflating victimhood with weakness instead of directing our opprobrium at those who victimize – the label will automatically have detractors. No one likes to be a victim, let alone conceive of themselves that way (no matter what George Will believes). But when women refuse to admit to ourselves that we’re systematically victimized, we give fuel to those on the political right who claim – despite all evidence to the contrary – that women are doing just fine.\\n\\nActually, the conservative rhetoric of late around rolling back women’s rights is mostly about women’s “independence”: we don’t need coverage for birth control, we choose the pay gap, we’re too strong for legal protections. (Of course this interest in women’s agency disappears when they’re discussing abortion, of which women are supposedly perpetual victims and in need of the most condescending laws on the books.)\\n\\nIf we’re unwilling to accept women’s factual status as victims in society, it makes it that much harder for society to accept those who hurt women as victimizers.\\n\\nThere’s a reason men like ESPN’s now temporarily-suspended Stephen A Smith say that women who are beaten need to “do your part” and avoid “elements of provocation”. As anti-violence educator and filmmaker Byron Hurt explained in Ebony, it’s because “[t]his deflection never fails. Men create excuses for their abusive behavior and deny women’s victimhood.”\\n\\nClearly there are women – for a myriad of reasons – who don’t want to identify as victims or support the idea that women are victimized. Maybe there are even a lucky few who have never experienced discrimination. But as a college professor once told me, the existence of a few women who have lived their lives under an umbrella of privilege does not mean that it’s not raining on the rest of us.\\n\\nNaming what is happening to women – that we are being oppressed, held back, and yes, victimized – is not weakness. It takes strength to tell uncomfortable truths.',\n",

On the Tumblr site [sample content: “The very name ‘feminism’ is discriminatory … To say that only through women can equal rights be claimed is like saying that only through black people can people have rights”], there are photos of women holding up handwritten or typed messages of why they don’t need feminsm. “I don’t need feminism because my boyfriend treats me right,” reads one.

       "  'text': 'The road-trip movie Thelma & Louise, starring Geena Davis (Thelma) and Susan Sarandon (Louise) as buddies-turned-fugitives, drove a national conversation on feminism and the state of the women’s movement when it hit theaters 25 years ago on May 24, 1991.\\n\\nSome fans and feminists hailed the movie as the ultimate story of “female revenge” for the way the two characters stand up to men—be they bad boyfriends or rapists, catcallers and cops—while others in media described the film as “degrading to men” and two hours of gratuitous violence. TIME covered the debate with a June 24, 1991, cover story in which film critic Richard Schickel summed up the questions about the movie as such:\\n\\nDoes it offer suitable ‘role models’? Is the ‘violence’ its heroines mete out to their tormentors really ’empowering’ to women, or does it represent a feckless sacrifice of the high moral ground? Is its indiscriminate ‘male bashing’ grossly unfair to an entire sex?\\n\\nAn accompanying op-ed by Margaret Carlson argued the film “can hardly be called a woman’s movie or one with a feminist sensibility.” For one, she wrote, Thelma is married to a man who treats her like his personal slave: “Thelma and Louise are so trapped that the only way for them to get away for more than two days is to go on the lam.” And then, after a near-rape on the road trip, Thelma feels all better after sleeping with another stranger, who ends up walking off with the duo’s money (a hitchhiker played by Brad Pitt, in what’s widely considered to be his breakout role). Thelma and Louise, she wrote, “become free but only wildly, self-destructively so—free to drive off the ends of the earth.”\\n\\nGet your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter\\n\\nThe film came at a time of great change in the American conversation about feminism. As the film history text Hollywood’s America: Twentieth Century America Through Film explains, some of the negative reaction to the movie may have reflected critics’ discomfort with the very real shifts taking place in the world at the time, namely the ways in which women were pushing back against traditional roles.\\n\\nIndeed, some events over the next year suggested that the movie arrived at exactly the right moment for stories about women speaking out.\\n\\nLater that year, law professor Anita Hill testified that she had been sexually harassed by current Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas during his confirmation hearings. Television coverage that captured the image of Hill being questioned by the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee panel is said to have helped women win historic victories in the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives — four seats in the former and 24 in the latter in 1992 — during what became known as “The Year of the Woman.”\\n\\nLikewise, many thought Thelma & Louise represented a new Hollywood willing to cast women in more diverse roles. Callie Khouri, who won a 1992 Academy Award for the screenplay, told TIME quite frankly that, “As a female moviegoer, I just got fed up with the passive role of women. They were never driving the story because they were never driving the car.”\\n\\nMORE: Jodie Foster on Directing in 1991: ‘This Is Not a Business That Is Kind to Women’\\n\\nBut, looking back from the distance of 25 years, it’s clear that—while Thelma & Louise spoke to a particular moment in time—it did not necessarily mark a turning point.\\n\\nFor example, the 1992 political victories “started the trend of electing more women,” according to California U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer, one of the politicians elected back then, but they were not able to change the culture on a “seniority-based Capitol Hill” overnight. That meant that old stereotypes and sexism continued to crop up, as U.S. House’s History, Art & Archives department explains: “Ultimately, however, the ‘Year of the Woman’ spawned expectations that women candidates in subsequent elections could not realistically meet.”\\n\\nAnd 25 years later, some data show that more work needs to be done in Hollywood, too. For instance, a recent study by Martha Lauzen at San Diego State University reports 12% of 2014’s 100 top-grossing films featured female protagonists and only about 30% of all speaking characters were women. Writing for TIME last year, Geena Davis, who launched the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, said her organization found that:\\n\\nFor every one female speaking character, there are three male characters. Women only make up about 17% of the people shown in crowds in live action and animated movies. And just about 7% of directors, about 13% of writers, and about 20% of producers are female.\\n\\nAs Sarandon said simply at the Cannes Film Festival last week, “After Thelma & Louise, they predicted there would be so many films starring women. But it didn’t happen.”\\n\\nRead the full 1991 cover story, here in the TIME Vault: Why Thelma & Louise Strikes a Nerve',\n",

It pictured a shouting, half-naked young woman, her chest painted with the circle-and-cross symbol universally understood as “female.” Her fist was clenched in protest, though what exactly she was demonstrating against was unclear—in the background, some distance behind her, a small phalanx of suited male figures guarded the steps of what looked to be a museum or a government building.\\n\\n“COMMIT TO SOMETHING” commands the copy that stretches from one end of the image to the other, and below that, in smaller text, is the gym’s tagline: “It’s Not Fitness.

In 2016, all we need to know is that she’s a feminist. Well, that—and that she’s in great shape.\\n\\nFor someone who has spent the past 20 years studying and writing about feminism’s long, symbiotic and often combative relationship to media and pop culture, the past few years have been a revelation. For decades, feminists and feminism were almost exclusively evoked by newspapers, magazines and punditry as an ideological punching bag; TIME’s 1999 cover blared “Is Feminism Dead?” using an image of pouting, miniskirted TV lawyer Ally McBeal to tacitly answer in the affirmative. These days, the word is deployed with a breathless thrill of zeitgeist, whether the topic is advertising (CoverGirl’s #GirlsCan campaign), celebrity culture (Taylor Swift! Emma Watson!), or electoral politics (play that woman card, Hillary!). Feminism, for better and for worse, has become trendy.\\n\\nThe moment when feminism broke into mainstream America like the Kool-Aid Man busting through a wall was arguably Beyoncé’s 2014 performance at MTV’s Video Music Awards, where she struck an indelible pose in front of huge neon letters spelling out the word “FEMINIST” as she quoted Nigerian writer Chimimanda Ngozi Adichie. But that moment didn’t come out of nowhere: it happened as part of a groundswell of awareness that had built over the preceding two decades via zines, blogs, grassroots organizing and social media—as well as via current events that brought intrinsically feminist ideas to audiences who’d only heard of feminism as something that came and went in the 1970s.\\n\\nThe are positive benefits to feminism’s rising profile. Take the high-school rape case in Steubenville, Ohio, for instance, which brought the concept of “victim blaming”—something that had percolated in feminist discourse for decades—into view. Or consider the Bechdel Test, a measure that looks at whether two women in a film speak to one another about something other than a man, which we now see referenced in film and TV criticism. And don’t forget Bill Cosby: it’s not a coincidence that the combination of feminism activism and social media was what finally brought down an alleged predatory comedian who’d been operating in plain sight for decades.\\n\\nAnd yet feminism’s recently skyrocketing profile is a reminder that the best way to constrain the power of a social movement is to commodify it. Just ask Dove, or Verizon or Always, brands that in the past few years have seemed to suddenly realize that flattering women with overtures to and images of female empowerment could offer a better return than classic ad tactics of appealing to feminine shame and insecurity. Ask Kim Kardashian, who hijacked the coverage of International Women’s Day—a day meant to draw attention to women’s economic, social and political status worldwide—with a blog post about a nude selfie that she universalized into a grand statement of body pride.\\n\\nThis kind of marketplace feminism is welcome not just because its optics are considered a media-friendly improvement on past feminist movements—more cleavage, less anger—but also because it draws focus away from the systemic and places it firmly in the realm of the individual and the personality-driven. It’s easy to see Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, for instance, urging women to lean in, and forget that leaning in puts the onus on women themselves—rather than on the corporate systems and values that shortchange all workers regardless of gender. It’s equally easy to nod along with Taylor Swift (or Madeleine Albright, for that matter) referencing that special place in hell for women who don’t support other women and assume that we’ve got the basic tenets of gender equality squared away. A look around the country at everything from the state of reproductive rights to the language of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign confirms that we don’t.\\n\\nWhat does it mean when a movement that is fundamentally unfinished is fashioned into a trend, a commodity, something to put on and/or take off at will? Marketplace feminism isn’t new: For as long as there have been feminist movements, Madison Avenue, Hollywood and more have been there to co-opt and cash in on them. But there’s a difference between making feminism attractive and making it meaningful to the millions of people who are more worried about earning a college degree or a living wage than they are in angling to get a heel into the C-suite. The appeal of marketplace feminism is that it doesn’t ask much of consumers.\\n\\nBut to make the world itself more feminist—safer, saner, more equitable, more sustainable—requires asking more of each other and ourselves than the market can answer. It involves asking difficult, complex and uncomfortable questions about what and who we value. It requires confronting the reality that the world has not evolved nearly as much as we’ve been led to believe it has. It needs us to admit that making us feel good about what we buy is not the same as making us feel purposeful about what we do. If we’re going to follow Equinox’s lead and commit to something, I propose we start with that.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Matt McGorry has a message for all the other nice guys out there: “Being nice is not enough to stop sexism or racism or any kind of -ism.”\\n\\nYou might know McGorry from his roles in Orange Is the New Black and How to Get Away With Murder, or from his viral Instagram post in support of the #FreetheNipple campaign, or from his Twitter spat with Piers Morgan in defense of Beyonce. If dude feminists formed a lacrosse team, he’d be the captain.\\n\\nMcGorry was sitting in the conference room of the Ms. Foundation headquarters, just a few hours before the organization’s annual Gloria Awards honoring feminists on Wednesday. He was chatting with Ms. Foundation President Teresa Younger and former football player Wade Davis, who came out nine years after he left the NFL, about male feminism and the Ms. Foundation’s #MyFeminismIs campaign to broaden the definition of feminism.\\n\\n“I actually don’t like to call myself an ally,” Davis said. “It’s almost like this title, being an ally is like ‘yeah, I’m here, too, we need a title also.’ No, we should just do the work.”\\n\\nYounger said guys like Davis and McGorry are crucial to the work of the Ms. Foundation, which she described as promoting “equality of all genders.” She said she wants to expand the feminism tent, so that nobody feels like feminism is only for people who “have read the right books, know the right terminology.” Ambassadors like Davis and McGorry, she said, can help educate men who are coming from the right place but don’t quite get it yet.\\n\\n“You have to just accept that people are going to say the wrong things sometimes, people are going to do the wrong things sometimes,” she said. “But if we genuinely sit in a place of ‘people are coming to be part of it,’ then that means we’re all learning.”\\n\\nFor McGorry, that means educating other men about how to actively fight sexism, not just stand back and refrain from making sexist comments. “The people that I’m trying to talk to are the other men out there who are good guys,” he said. “If you’re in high school and watching a bully beat someone up, it’s not going to help if you stand there saying ‘I support you.’ You have to be willing to take a few punches.”\\n\\nMcGorry has taken a few punches himself. Some feminists object to the whole idea of male feminism—or at least the excessive celebration of men who are carrying the feminist torch that women have been carrying this whole time. McGorry gets that, and he said he’s bothered by the backlash, but it’s not going to make him stop.\\n\\n“Speaking out about these things, as much as there’s a lot of sh*t out there that frankly hurts my feelings a lot, it’s never going to be as hard as being a woman or being trans or being black,” he said. “And especially never going to be as hard as speaking out about sexism or racism as a woman or a person of color.”\\n\\nDavis said men have a unique opportunity—and therefore a unique responsibility—to educate other men about what they can do to support feminism. He said sometimes his friends will float out thoughts about gender equality, just to see if he’ll set them straight. “Men will go to barbershops sometimes to see what other men are thinking,” he said, adding that he sees all-male spaces as the perfect place to talk about feminism.\\n\\nBeing a male feminist means actively promoting feminism among men and answering questions from other well-meaning guys so that women don’t have to—and that’s McGorry’s favorite part. “I tweeted: ‘when you’re used to privilege, equality feels like oppression,’ and one of my friends I was like ‘can you give me an example of that?’” he said, punching his fist in the air. “And I’m like F**k yea! Ask me again! Got ‘em!”',\n",

       "  'text': 'In her much-anticipated Elle interview published Tuesday, Beyoncé spoke about the meaning behind her “Formation” video and clarified that she is against police brutality, but not anti-police.\\n\\n“Anyone who perceives my message as anti-police is completely mistaken. I have so much admiration and respect for officers and the families of officers who sacrifice themselves to keep us safe,” Beyoncé said. “But let’s be clear: I am against police brutality and injustice. Those are two separate things.”\\n\\nHer “Formation” song, which the singer also performed at the Super Bowl halftime show, was greeted by fans and critics as a celebration of the fight for equality—for women, for African-Americans and for LGBTQ people. But it also drew the ire of police unions and even former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, who argued that her Black Lives Matter message was anti-police, with some even calling for a boycott of her tour. (One shot in the “Formation” video shows “Stop Shooting Us” written in graffiti and the video ends with Beyoncé sinking into the water atop a police car.)\\n\\nBeyonce fired back at such critics in her interview: “If celebrating my roots and culture during Black History Month made anyone uncomfortable, those feelings were there long before a video and long before me,” she said.\\n\\nThe “Formation” flap isn’t the first time that the pop superstar has come under fire for her politics, and Beyoncé also took the opportunity address her stance on feminism. While many (including this writer) applauded the singer for emblazoning the word “feminist” behind her during her Mrs. Carter tour, and defining it in her song “Flawless,” some objected to her use of the word.\\n\\n“I put the definition of feminist in my song [“Flawless”] and on my tour, not for propaganda or to proclaim to the world that I’m a feminist, but to give clarity to the true meaning,” Beyoncé told Elle. “I’m not really sure people know or understand what a feminist is, but it’s very simple. It’s someone who believes in equal rights for men and women,” she added. “I don’t understand the negative connotation of the word, or why it should exclude the opposite sex. If you are a man who believes your daughter should have the same opportunities and rights as your son, then you’re a feminist.”\\n\\nBeyoncé also clarified that the issues of race and gender are not mutually exclusive for her: “I don’t like or embrace any label. I don’t want calling myself a feminist to make it feel like that’s my one priority, over racism or sexism or anything else,” she said. “I’m just exhausted by labels and tired of being boxed in. If you believe in equal rights, the same way society allows a man to express his darkness, to express his pain, to express his sexuality, to express his opinion—I feel that women have the same rights.”\\n\\nThe pop star is launching her own athletic clothing line, Ivy Park, this week.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Often when I’m being interviewed about my career and music, I’m asked whether I am a feminist. What the interviewer means depends on who’s doing the asking and what their take on the feminist movement is. Sometimes it’s rhetorical. Other times, a thinly veiled indictment. My answer is always yes. I have never been apologetic about this, but rather deeply passionate. It is an honor to be considered a feminist.\\n\\nThe concept of feminism to me is a mandatory link in a chain toward wholeness, cohesion, maturation and functionality—certainly the feminist movement is one of the most powerful means to this greater end. I do believe, however, that the definition of feminism needs some refocusing, redefining and updating for this modern time, and for this new generation, and that the movement deserves a reorienting, intentionality and re-envisioning for what is possible and how to get there. We need a revolution to the feminist revolution. And it needs to be brought to the fore of our awareness in order to heal what ails our times on this planet.\\n\\nHere’s why: So much of the movement has been about (often willfully, and for good reason) forcing justice upon a patriarchal system that too often reduces the feminine to maintain the reign of the disempowered masculine. The patriarchy has always seemed an ignorant and emotionally immature purgatory at best, and, at worst, a liminal despair-filled holding pattern carefully held together by resistance, hate, hostility and separatism—the cost of which is felt across every area of life, in women and men alike.\\n\\nThis patriarchal acting-out is ultimately an indication of our collective spiritual and emotional immaturity. And if we are to heal our way out of this disconnected way of living, we would have to heal by growing our undeveloped aspects of ourselves, and take that healing process very seriously. Regardless of our past, of how we were raised, of the many valid reasons why we remain arrested at various immature past stages of our development, if we chose not to heal or grow out of having been frozen, nothing can change within the patriarchy, and ultimately, nothing can change in the world around us. It is up to us, collectively, to move into this inquiry of how to grow parts of us that never had a chance to when we were young.\\n\\nPatriarchy may afford a false sense of power afforded to those who keep the hate in place, but that power is temporary and false, and it will never yield the peace and well-being that is not only possible but is every person’s birthright. The water of what is possible through accepting the goal of wholeness by embracing the feminine still rushes powerfully as the dam of patriarchy stays willfully (if not temporarily) frozen in place.\\n\\nWhile I have had my share of challenges with the male species, outright radical man-hating—regardless of how much it has been projected onto me because I wrote a song called “You Oughta Know” about being devastated by a break-up—has never been my pervasive thing.\\n\\nIn fact, if I were to add anything to my personal exuberant sense of being a feminist, it would be that feminism is incomplete without its dualistic brother, its complement, and, ideally, its greatest supporter: the empowered masculine. Developing the capacity to separate the masculine from the man and the feminine from the woman has served me well in understanding the continuum of both qualities. Whether this is indicated in our choices sexually, physically, emotionally, vocationally or artistically, we are moving ever closer to getting a real sense of who we are as humans based on where we fall on this continuum. Man or woman, we are all a little bit of both masculine and feminine, in degrees that vary from one person to the next. And the degree to which we embrace these qualities within us dictates our level of personal agency, esteem and freedom in our lives.\\n\\nIn this sense you might call me a humanist, or better yet, a “wholeness-ist.” As it turns out, embracing the breadth of both sets of qualities that we have within us, regardless of what the context (aka society) says it expects of us or not, is the work of brave front-line activism. Who knew that to be who we truly are would be an act of rebellion in the world?\\n\\nThe delicate and powerful outcome of what happens when the feminine and the masculine work in tandem is what I am interested in, and with whatever percentages of each that each human being naturally evidences. What is inherently required in the beginning of the journey of embracing true gender-equality is the long overdue respect for and consideration of and credence due to the feminine, to females and to more feminine males. There has been so much death, mutilation, annihilation, reduction, aversion and obliteration of the feminine and the female/feminine body as has been evidenced with female genital mutilation, sex trafficking, hyper-sexualization in entertainment and pop culture, LGBT hate, unequal pay, lack of education about the female body, public shaming, bashing and bullying, and to know it is still happening across the planet on a daily basis is nothing short of soul-killing and archaic. Watching this within, without and about this life has left me unable to put this existential pain and despair into words. But I cannot push it aside. It is with this crack in my soul that I persevere alongside so many toward the greater goal of arriving at our wholeness as a species.\\n\\nIn more Westernized places, today, after many years and chapters of tireless effort, women can be presidents (if still frequently challenged on the basis of their gender) or CEOs (if still having had to work 10 times harder than men to get there) or movie stars (if still having to fight to earn anywhere near the same wage as their male co-stars), or play the natural roles that they were born to play with less resistance. Could this in fact be proving that the days of the egregiously polarized masculine and feminine are slowly tip-toeing toward the light at the end of the tunnel of unification or integration of both these parts? Painstakingly slowly, to be sure.\\n\\nIf the goal is less polarization and the greater acceptance of the masculine and the feminine qualities in all of us, then the goal being in sight might well be the gift that this new generation and new era is offering. And our eyes cannot avert from this prize if we truly want peace within and without on this planet.\\n\\nWe must infuse this feminine movement (as I prefer to call it) with a new clarity and passion, coming at it from another angle, thinking of this across-the-world challenge as more of a question—how can we move both the feminine and the masculine toward greater maturity and empowerment? For if patriarchy (disempowered masculine) relies on a silenced and reduced feminine (disempowered feminine), then true empowerment is an internal movement toward maturation and healing, and renewed defining of personal power and responsibility and a re-working of what it means to achieve success on this planet. And it is asked of both genders alike. It is an inside-out shift that would change everything we see around us—toward acceptance and allowance, sure, but also towards support, appreciation, honor and connection.\\n\\nThe unification conversation would have to continue in earnest, not just put a stop in the gap, only to spring another leak. If the false messages and choices born from a disempowered masculinity are not arrested at their root, we are merely putting out a small flame while the rest of the forest burns down.\\n\\nThe saying “that which we resist persists” applies here: Hating men for the oppression we as women have experienced—a justified rage and retaliation in so many regards, and Lord knows I have enjoyed my cushion on this bandwagon—just keeps the gender and gender-quality divide ever entrenched.\\n\\nWe must take our passion and energy for the lunacy of this reductivism and channel it toward change: addressing first, the egregious lack of celebration of the feminine and all feminine qualities; and second, and equally important, the redefinition of what empowerment looks like in the masculine.\\n\\nIn areas of the newly empowered masculine, things like competition, and the divisive mindset that competition requires would quell. The sublimation of emotions and the rewarding for that would wane, and men and women alike would be less resistant to the natural flow of emotions that course through their bodies every day, serving as intuitive indications to be investigated, versus sensations to be obliterated through stoicism or medicating. Aggression would be used when appropriate (during a workout, or while climbing a mountain, or while lifting something heavy while serving the whole), and the propensity to serve and protect would be geared toward those who warrant this provision and protection: the feminine within and without, and the more vulnerable. Basically, we would notice our collective eye moving more toward the success and well-being of the WHOLE, rather than the scarcity-fueled stronghold of abundance of the few.\\n\\nIn areas of the newly empowered feminine, abilities like submission would be used in its proper and appropriate contexts, surrendering and faith and dropping arms would be valued as deeply wise, and vulnerability and innocence would be seen as our natural innate qualities, and would be powerfully guarded as such. “Weakness” would be more respectfully associated with yielding (a deeply intuitive ability) or resting (an underrated action in today’s work addicted world) or humility, with humility serving as a portal to our own sense of spirituality—a lost goal in a world obsessed with industry and “might being right.” World leaders of both genders would be oriented toward teaching and modeling healing and inspiring a less punishment-oriented but more cause-and-effect consequence experiencing version of responsibility-taking—sure signs of the focus on supporting the emotional, psychological and spiritual maturation of the planet’s people.\\n\\nThere would be many changes that we would see all around us—some subtle, and some that would tip the world on its axis financially and politically. Many more opportunities would open up for both genders. There would be a planetary healing, a tenderness, a repair, a recovery, a sense of things returning to “how they were meant to be,” a homecoming. People could actually be who they truly and authentically are.\\n\\nFlying in the face of our deeply entrenched survival strategies and long-held defenses (life-supporting when we were young, turned life-denying as we grow into adulthood) and prejudices is not for the weak of heart. When glimpses of a new way to live occur, it is truly a powerful and light-filled sight to behold. We have already seen it take shape in fits and starts in this new generation and in our culture: More fathers being supported. Fewer power-struggle-filled forms of parenting and relating. More emotional literacy. More masculine-oriented women having the careers that they have dreamed of since they were very young. More empowered men supporting empowered women. More diversity. More acceptance of personal lifestyle and sexual preference choices. More connection. More responsibility.\\n\\nThe feminist credo being evidenced everywhere around the planet relies solely on our emotional, spiritual and psychological maturation. The degree to which the feminine imperative is lived is commensurate to the degree that our consciousness is raised. And we raise our consciousness by taking responsibility for our own healing and reparation of wounds from our past, and cultivating the ability to regulate our nervous systems in an overstimulated world.\\n\\nA focus on empowered versions of both the masculine and the feminine will serve us better than having either quality be seen as better or worse than the other. We need both. And that is why I see the feminine movement as the next step in our evolution toward liberation on this planet. We bring the feminine up to her rightful seat. And the masculine to its rightful seat next to the feminine. This is my prayer. This is my wish. This is my mission. And it will require both the masculine and feminine qualities in me to continue to move toward it alongside so many other people with the same vision. May our steps continue to be guided by our vision of wholeness, connection and deep peace.',\n",

       "  'date': '2015072219',\n",
       "  'text': 'At first glance, the four stars of a new Saudi television drama, “Mubta’ethat” or “Sponsored Women,” look a little mis-matched. There’s Salma, a chic tomboy with short hair and red lipstick, Raghad, a glam-girl with confident strides and princess curls, Sara, a feisty hijabi with colorful clothing, and Alia, a cautious girl who wears a black niqab (covering of the hair and entire face, with only slits for the eyes). But they have one thing in common: They’ve each got a U.S. visa page in their green passport. It is their golden ticket to leave their homes in Saudi Arabia to pursue an education in Philadelphia.\\n\\nThe show highlights how these Saudi women fluidly adapt to a Western world while maintaining their Eastern ideals. They enroll in English classes, move into their own apartments and learn how to drive a car. They all steer their own lives for the first time.\\n\\nThe script plays with the obvious contrasts inherent in the plot–the girls are almost as different from each other as their culture is from the one they’ll encounter in the United States. It manages to also dig into stereotypes about America or women in veils.\\n\\nDuring the 30 episodes, the women are forced to identify with each other and confront their own biases. Their friendship can be compared to that of a certain all-female cult HBO show from the 90s. The now classic formula of bringing together very different girls with strong personalities and courageous adventures still works. This time, with a Saudi accent.\\n\\nThe program debuted on June 17, the first day of Ramadan, and was broadcast in Saudi Arabia every night through the Holy month which ended in mid-July.\\n\\nThe show enjoyed a steady viewership over the course of the month. Each night, the episode would be uploaded on YouTube after it airs, and the comment section would quickly populate. “These girls don’t represent any Saudi girl I know and I’m a sponsored student,” reads a comment. “This is an amazing series, can’t wait for the next episode,” reads another. The positive reviews seem to outweigh the negative ones. Since it is broadcast during the Holy Month, this revolutionary show is representing millennials in a way that Saudi TV hasn’t otherwise seen.\\n\\nThe show has an impressive pedigree: Directed by Oscar-nominated Saudi superstar, Haifaa Al Mansour and written by her sister, Noura Al Mansour, it was produced by Rotana Khalejia, a company that is partially owned by Saudi Prince Al Waleed Bin Talal.\\n\\nThe characters are from key parts of Saudi and represent different lifestyles and social temperaments. Surely, young girls in Saudi can identify with qualities found in every one of these women.\\n\\nSalma is from the liberal West Coast, Raghad is from the luxurious capital, Sara is from the moderate East Coast and Alia is originally from conservative Al Qassim.\\n\\nEach family reacts differently to the departure of their daughter to the faraway continent. And while each girl has at least one family member closely watching over them in Philadelphia, letting go is still nerve wrecking for the families.\\n\\nIn one comical scene, Alia’s mother is seen stealthily stuffing stacks of (imported) ramen noodles and sacks of rice into her daughter’s luggage before departing from Saudi. “They have that food in America!” her frustrated husband protests. “No! It’s laced with drugs there!” the exasperated mother replies. They are nervous about sending their only child, a daughter, to the unknown.\\n\\n“It smells like freedom! Of course, it tastes like nicotine,” Salma, says on the phone, as she cautiously drags a puff from a cigarette upon arrival to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Despite being a few continents away, she maintains the Saudi fear of being seen smoking in public.\\n\\nActress Noor Al Badr who plays Salma, is a doctor in real life. She got “the randomest call” from Al Mansour who asked her to join the cast. Five days later, Al Badr was on the plane to Bahrain, where they shot most of the show.\\n\\n“Of course, most people thought I was crazy. I was a doctor! According to most people in our society, acting is not something to be proud of. I think I’m the first Saudi girl to smoke on TV. I wanted to break the taboo,” Al Badr said.\\n\\nNo Saudi feminist show would be complete without the subject of the hijab. The irony is not lost on the characters. Two of the characters don’t cover their hair and two do. In one scene, Salma says of Alia, “She can see everyone but nobody can see her.” Alia, played by actress Zara Albaloshi, repeats how her covering is the ultimate feminist statement. Perhaps most surprising of all, Alia falls in love with a non-Muslim American, Jason, who lives in her building. He becomes interested in Islam and converts. By the end of the series, Alia, the girl who only reveals her eyes to the world, gives her heart to Jason.\\n\\nThe show’s U.S. location is also telling: Philadelphia is central to the American Dream. It is where the Founding Fathers signed the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States.\\n\\nThe women are in the U.S. on an academic scholarship, called the Saudi Scholarship. They are “sponsored,” hence the title of the show. Saudi Arabia has been funding Saudi students in the U.S. since 1960, but the late King Abdullah’s Scholarship Program, which launched a decade ago, was the largest push in encouraging female citizens to study abroad. In just five decades, Saudi girls went from not knowing how to read or write to a 97 percent literacy rate, according to UNICEF.\\n\\nAlthough the image of Saudi women has changed over the generations, the outdated impressions haven’t yet caught up with reality. The show makes a point of addressing these issues.\\n\\n“With 150,000 men and women studying abroad, why is Saudi considered to be a ‘developing country?’ In reality, it is quite developed,” Sara, played by actress Maram Abdulaziz, asks her classmates in one scene.\\n\\nActress Noura Assar’s character, Raghad, has her camera at the ready to document the trials and triumphs of her Saudi female friends. An aspiring actress and director, Raghad’s quiet rebellion comes in the form of selecting that area of study. There is no such industry in Saudi Arabia today.\\n\\nAssar thinks the show is starting a different conversation. “I am proud to say that the image of Saudi women has come a long way from what it used to be; strong Saudi women always existed, however, the image was very much attached to a certain stereotype. The scholarships, I’d say, participated in this change due to the ‘face to face’ method of dealing with others, where people in other countries saw for themselves what these ladies can achieve and become,” she said.\\n\\n“Just because we can’t drive doesn’t mean we can’t fly and reach for the stars. Hope the show will continue next Ramadan!” Al Badr said.',\n",

       "  'title': \"Caitlin Stasey's NSFW Herself.com Is Moving Feminism Forward\",\n",
       "  'date': '2015012119',\n",
       "  'text': 'Australian actress and CW star Caitlin Stasey recently launched a website, Herself.com (NSFW), featuring interviews with ordinary women (aka non-celebs) about topics like masturbation, pornography, reproductive rights, sexual identity and the female body. The site is the latest addition to the ongoing conversation about women and the media, which in recent years has stretched from the #freethenipple campaign (which advocates women’s right to go topless in public) to Dove’s “Real Beauty” advertisements to Beyonce’s 2014 VMA performance.\\n\\nHerself is a much-needed feminist tribute to both the minds and bodies of women, and there’s an abundance of nudity featured on the site — hardly a surprise given Stasey’s outspoken stance on female sexuality. In fact, naked women are the first things visitors of Herself.com see. Sure, the site’s thought-provoking interviews may get glossed over by viewers focusing on the subject’s naked bodies, but their overt nakedness is giving a different attitude about the female body the push forward it needs in mainstream media.\\n\\n“A woman rarely gets the opportunity to just live in herself, as herself, a fully autonomous, self-determining human being. I wanted to give women the chance to reclaim that for themselves,” Stasey said in a recent interview. “The fact that it is a matter of controversy that a woman should choose to be nude without it being an act of sex just shows how backward and oppressive our society is. It shouldn’t matter. It shouldn’t warrant questioning.”\\n\\nBy overtly displaying the female form, Herself has the potential to expose its subjects to objectification, and the site’s garnered a mild amount of criticism on social media. But major publications such as Glamour and People are eager to praise Stasey’s uncensored tribute to women of all kinds.\\n\\nStasey encourages readers to “witness the female form in all its honesty without the burden of the male gaze.” The initial buzz surrounding Herself lead to the site trending on Facebook with the description “actress launches website for women featuring personal interviews and nude photos,” basically guaranteeing men will visit. Yet even allowing for the fact that she’s exposing herself to the male gaze, Stasey remains unfazed.\\n\\n“I sincerely hope men come to the site and learn to see how women present themselves, how women look when they are not merely objects, but the living, breathing subjects of their own stories,” she says. “This is a site made by a woman for women about women,” Stasey adds.\\n\\nGoing full-frontal in the name of feminism isn’t without its controversies, but the women in Herself are showcasing their own bodies on their own terms. Not only that, but they’re reaching a new generation of teen readers thanks to the 24-year-old actress’ star role on the CW’s Reign. Ultimately Herself gives women the opportunity to decide whether they want their bodies showcased online — and no one should judge them for that.\\n\\n“If [feminism] is anything less than a woman getting to live her life proudly and freely, then I probably wouldn’t march for it,” says Stasey. “If you think feminism is telling other women how to live, then we’ll never agree, and I’m fine with that. Our feminism is nothing less than freedom.”\\n\\nHerself is about as safe as it gets for like-minded feminists wanting to share their beliefs, fears and hopes, as well as for Stasey’s teen fans who are just becoming aware of their bodies, sexuality and sexual identity. And for someone visiting the site for the nude pics? They’ll definitely learn something while they’re at it.',\n",

       "  'date': '2014121319',\n",
       "  'text': 'The first few seconds of Wild sound like sex. You hear a woman panting and moaning as the camera pans across the forest, and it seems like the movie is starting off with an outdoor quickie. But it’s not the sound of two hikers hooking up: it’s the sound of Cheryl Strayed, played by Reese Witherspoon, climbing a mountain all by herself.\\n\\nIt lasts only a moment, but that first shot contains everything you need to know about why Wild is so important. It’s a story of a woman who hikes the Pacific Crest Trail for 94 days in the wake of her mother’s death, but more than that, it’s a story of a woman who is no longer anything to anybody. We’re so used to seeing women entangled with other people (with parents, with men, with children, in neurotic friendships with other women), that it’s surprising, almost shocking, to see a woman who is gloriously, intentionally, radically alone.\\n\\nWhen it comes to women onscreen, the lone frontier is the last frontier. It’s no big deal to see women play presidents, villains, baseball players, psychopaths, superheroes, math geniuses, or emotionally stunted losers. We’ve even had a female Bob Dylan. But a woman, alone, in the wilderness, for an entire movie? Not until now.\\n\\nWhich is unfair, considering all the books and movies dedicated to the often-tedious excursions of solitary men, from Henry David Thoreau to Jack Kerouac to Christopher McCandless. Audiences have sat through hours of solo-dude time in critically acclaimed movies like Castaway, Into the Wild, Life of Pi, 127 Hours, and All is Lost. America loves a Lone Ranger so much, even Superman worked alone.\\n\\nIn fact, the only thing more central to the American canon than a solitary guy hanging out in the woods is a guy on a quest (think Huckleberry Finn or Moby Dick). The road narrative may be the most fundamental American legend, grown from our history of pilgrimage and Western expansion. But adventure stories are almost always no-girls-allowed, partly because the male adventurer is usually fleeing from a smothering domesticity represented by women. In our collective imaginations, women don’t set out on a journey unless they’re fleeing from something, usually violence. As Vanessa Veselka writes in her excellent essay on female road narratives in The American Reader: “A man on the road is caught in the act of a becoming. A woman on the road has something seriously wrong with her. She has not ‘struck out on her own.’ She has been shunned.”\\n\\nMORE: The Top 10 Best Movies of 2014\\n\\nThe ‘loner in nature’ and the ‘man on the road’ are our American origin stories, our Genesis and Exodus. They’re fables of an American national character which, as A.O. Scott pointed out in his The New York Times essay on the death of adulthood in American culture, has always tended towards the boyish. Wild is the first big movie– or bestselling book, for that matter–to re-tell that central American story with a female protagonist.\\n\\nBut Wild is just the most visible example of what’s been a slow movement towards loner ladies onscreen. Sandra Bullock’s solo spin through space last year in Gravity was the first step (although her aloneness was accidental, and it was more a survival story than road narrative). Mia Wasikowska’s long walk across Australia in Tracks this year was another. But Wild, based on Strayed’s bestselling memoir and propelled by Witherspoon’s star power, is the movie that has the best shot at moving us past the now-tired “power woman” towards a new kind of feminist role model: the lone female.\\n\\nBecause for women, aloneness is the next frontier. Despite our chirpy boosting of “independent women” and “strong female leads,” it’s easy to forget that women can never be independent if we’re not allowed to be alone.\\n\\nFor men, solitude is noble: it implies moral toughness, intellectual rigor, a deep connection with the environment. For women, solitude is dangerous: a lone woman is considered vulnerable to attacks, pitiful for her lack of male companionship, or threatening to another woman’s relationship. We see women in all kinds of states of loneliness–single, socially isolated, abandoned–but almost never in a state of deliberate, total aloneness.\\n\\nNot to mention the fact that women’s stories are almost always told in the context of their relationships with other people. Even if you set aside romance narratives, the “girl group” has become the mechanism for telling the stories of “independent” women– that is, women’s stories that don’t necessarily revolve around men. Think Sex & The City, Steel Magnolias, A League of Their Own, Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, Girls: if a woman’s not half of a couple, she must be part of a gaggle.\\n\\nWhen Cheryl Strayed describes her experience of “radical aloneness,” she’s talking about being completely cut off from human contact–no cell phone, no credit card, no GPS. But her aloneness is also radical in that it rejects the female identity that is always viewed through the lens of a relationship with someone else. To be alone, radically alone, is to root yourself in your own life, not the role you play in other people’s lives. Or, as Strayed’s mother Bobbi wistfully puts it, “I always did what someone else wanted me to do. I’ve always been someone’s daughter or mother or wife. I’ve never just been me.”\\n\\nMORE: The Top 10 Best Movie Performances of 2014\\n\\nAnd that’s the difference between aloneness and independence. The “independent woman” is nothing new– if anything, it’s become a tired catchphrase of a certain kind of rah-rah feminism. “Independence” implies a relationship with another thing, a thing from which you’re severing your ties. It’s inherently conspicuous, even performative. Female independence has become such a trope that it’s become another role for women to play: independent career woman, independent post-breakup vixen, independent spitfire who doesn’t care what anyone thinks. And usually, that “independence” is just a temporary phase before she meets a guy at the end of the movie who conveniently “likes a woman who speaks her mind.”\\n\\nAloneness is more fundamental, and more difficult. It involves cultivating a sense of self that has little to do with the motherhood, daughterhood, wifehood or friendship that society calls “womanhood.” When interviewed by the Hobo Times about being a “female hobo,” Strayed says: “Women can’t walk out of their lives. They have families. They have kids to take care of.” Aloneness then, isn’t just a choice to focus on one’s self– it’s also a rejection of all the other social functions women are expected to perform.\\n\\nIn 1995, when Strayed hiked for 94 days, that would have been hard. In 2014, it’s even harder. Thanks to the internet, our world is more social now than ever before, and it’s even harder to escape other people. But aloneness is at the root of real independence, it’s where self-reliance begins and ends. So these days, if you want to be independent, maybe you can start by trying to be alone.\\n\\nRead next: Reese Witherspoon Isn’t Nice or Wholesome in Wild, and That’s What Makes It Great',\n",

       "  'text': 'Caitlin Moran doesn’t give a damn if you think she’s polite. Nope, the author and columnist — en route back to London after a whirlwind New York City tour — has never bothered to check her words at the door. An in an era where lives, and voices, can be literally curated, her prose is refreshing.\\n\\nMoran made headlines when her first book, How to Be a Woman, a memoir, earned her comparisons to Lena Dunham and Tina Fey. Her latest, a novel, is called How to Build a Girl, and is a coming of age story – of sorts that’s being published as young adult fiction, but read by women of all ages. (A coming of age story with a lot, a lot, of sex.) Moran spoke with TIME about feminism, sex, the revolution and all sorts of other things:\\n\\nTIME: I don’t know if I realized that in addition to your books, and doing a standup comedy tour, you write weekly for the Times of London. How do you manage to be so prolific?\\n\\nMORAN: Two years ago, when How To Be a Woman took off, I got people coming up to me saying “Do you want to make a sitcom? Do you want to make a film? Do you want to write a novel? Do you want to do stand-up? Do you still want to write two columns a week for The Times?” And I said yes to everything. So now my ass is cashing the check my mouth wrote. Also: coffee.\\n\\nDo you think you could have attracted the same audience for a “feminist” piece of work a few years ago?\\n\\nIt is an amazing time to be a female artist. There’s clearly a wave of women at the moment — Amy Schumer, Lena Dunham, Tina Fey, Chelsea Handler, the Broad City girls, Mindy Kaling, Amy Poehler — who have all come to the same realisation: you just don’t get any credit if you carry on being a timid, polite girl scared of talking about sex, abortion, politics, the physical bullshit of being a woman. You go to all this effort to be non-controversial and ‘good’ and not only does it f–k you up personally and emotionally, but there’s no career in it, either.\\n\\nSo how do you make a career?\\n\\nWith my working class ghetto background, I love telling girls that there’s money to be made in the revolution. You don’t just have to do it out of love. And you’re making your money out of being amusing and honest and unclenching women’s buttocks and making them feel like ‘Hey! Rather than trying to be a thin, hairless, well-groomed woman in uncomfortable shoes and a tight expensive dress, I’m just going to PURSUE JOY instead. I’m going to enjoy my life, because you’re a long time dead, and what I actually want to do is eat a cheese sandwich, have a shag, go for a brisk walk, and then watch Ghostbusters.’\\n\\nOn the shag point… there are a lot of people who are still surprised by a woman talking so candidly about women and sex. Why do you think we’re so afraid of female sexuality?\\n\\nThe funny thing about me writing ‘frankly’ about sex is that my generation still doesn’t get it. We still don’t realize what our 12 and 13 and 14 year olds are doing – they’re watching hard core pornography. So me writing an amusing, warm, kind book about hetero-normative consensual sex and masturbation is like … whatever. I mean, most teenagers would be like ‘where is the sex in here?’ But what is important is the tone in what I write. For teenage girls – and boys – to read about sex being discussed cheerfully, and truthfully, and with a sense of glee and gossipy ‘Oh my god NO!’\\n\\nYour daughter is 13. Your protagonist is 14. I think my parents were scared to death when I was that age. How do you describe the glorious teen mind?\\n\\nTeenagers are extraordinary – I remember all my teen years with utter clarity – because everything’s new. Everything’s a first. First kiss, first party, first outfit you chose and bought yourself, first train journey, first cigarette – first record you love so much you think the love will actually, utterly kill you. Or make you rule the world. It’s why pretty much everything I’ll ever write will be about teenage girls. Fat, gobby working class clever gleeful brilliant idiot teenage girls. It’s a Woody Allen deal. He does New York Jewish men. I do gobby working class teenage girls.\\n\\nYour column is not an advice column, but you give pretty damn good advice. Got any for the teen girl in all of us?\\n\\nYou just need three hobbies: long country walks – get some air into your lungs – masturbation, and the revolution. With those three things, the chances of a teenage girls’ worst enemy – self-loathing – taking root are minimal. Wank away the pain!\\n\\nOne of the things I observe constantly among women my age is this utter lack of confidence. The fumbling over owning our voice. The apologizing before we speak. The ending statements in a question. Where’d you get the, er, balls to just not care?\\n\\nFake it ‘til you make it, as Johanna [her new book’s protagonist] discovers, is the key thing. I wrote my first novel when I was 15, and when I went down to London to have a meeting about publishing it, I froze in the doorway, thinking ‘I can’t take this meeting! I don’t know what to do!’ I was a very overweight virgin too poor to have a coat – I was wearing a dressing gown, instead – with no friends, and no education, and no idea of how to talk to adults. And I had a brilliant and revolutionary thought, as I stood in that doorway: ‘Well – just pretend to be someone who does know what to do.’\\n\\nI chose Courtney Love. I spent the next five years pretending to be her. Because she seemed fearless. Because she didn’t care what people thought about her. This is why culture is so important – why it’s key for us to see as many different people as possible; why its embarrassing that people of colour, LGBT and woman are so under-represented on TV, in movies, in the media. Or that, when we appear, it’s still in largely stereotypical, non-lead roles. You cannot be what you cannot see. Give us more strong, amazing, fantastical people that we can pretend to be, in those difficult years when we’re building ourselves.\\n\\nThere’s a new documentary that premiered on PBS this week about women and comedy. How do you think humor informs your work? Do you think feminism could use a dose of …. gasp, humor?\\n\\nHumour is key, because I’m piously committed to TOTAL REVOLUTION. I’m not just writing and performing about mental illness, abortion, feminism, socialism, LGBT equality, intersectionality, poverty, welfare because I like the sound of my own voice – mainly because my own voice is horrible: I sound like a rasping goose. I properly want to change people’s minds. And if you communicate with anger, 90% of what people hear is the anger. They’re not listening to what you’re actually saying. They’ll just start arguing back at you. And that is exactly what you can see happening with so much online activism.\\n\\nEveryone’s buttocks immediately unclench. People actually listen to what you’re saying. Plus, the revolution becomes fun again.',\n",

She also said that if she had had a strong feminist role model at a young age, she would have declared herself as one earlier:\\n\\nThe only thing that I saw was incredible acclaim and praise, and that’s just me going off of what I’m tuned into which is my fan base of real girls out in the world living their lives. And when they saw their favorite actress get up in front of the UN and say what she said, I wish when I was younger, I wish when I was 12-years-old I had been able to watch a video of my favorite actress explaining in such an intellectual, beautiful, poignant way the definition of feminism. Because I would have understood it. And then earlier on in my life I would have proudly claimed I was a feminist because I would have understood what the word means.\\n\\nSwift argues that many young girls, including her younger self, associate feminism with negativity when it simply means equality among the genders.\\n\\nSo many girls out there say, “I’m not a feminist” because they think it means something angry or disgruntled or complaining or they picture, like, rioting and picketing. It is not that it all. It just simply means that you believe that women and men should have equal right and opportunities, and to say that you’re not a feminist means you think men should have more rights and opportunities than women. I just think a lot of girls don’t know the definition, and the fact that Emma got up and explained it I think is an incredible thing, and I’m happy to live in a world where that happened.\\n\\nThe definition of feminism has become a hot-button topic among female celebrities this year. Many stars have declared themselves not to be feminists because they “love men.” But others, like Swift, have asserted a simpler definition of feminism that does not involve hating men: for example, in her song “Flawless,” Beyoncé samples a speech from Nigerian-born writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie who defines a feminist as “a person who believes in the social, political and economic equality of the sexes.”\\n\\nIn other parts of the interview, Swift offered her views on being a woman in the media:\\n\\nI think when it comes to females in the media, you’ll see something that kind of upsets me which is that females are pinned up against each other more so than men. For example, you never see online, vote for who has the better butt: this actor or this actor? It’s always, like, this female singer and this female singer, and you get to vote. It’s daily that I see these things and these polls, like, let us know who’s sexier? Who’s the hotter mama? I just don’t see: who’s the hotter dad? One thing that I do believe as a feminist is that in order for us to have gender equality, we have to stop making it a girl fight. We have to stop being so interested in seeing girls trying to tear each other down. It has to be about cheering each other on as women. And that’s just kind of how I feel about it.\\n\\nAnd when the interviewer asked her about Miley Cyrus’s scandalous outfits (perhaps doing the exact thing Swift hates by trying to pit her against another female singer her age), Swift responded that she supports women singers expressing their sexuality:\\n\\nI think that no other female artist should be able to tell me to wear less clothes and I’m not going to tell any other female artist to wear more clothes. As long as it’s their idea, and they’re expressing their sexuality or they’re expressing their strength or it makes them feel like a woman to perform a certain way or dress a certain way… as long as it’s coming from them and they’re living their life on their own terms, I cheer them on.\\n\\nWatch the entire interview here.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Sweden is already known for its progressive policies, but on Sept. 14, this Scandinavian country could be among the first in the world to elect a feminist party to its parliament.\\n\\nFeministiskt Initiativ—a left leaning and anti-racist political party that was founded in 2005—has gained popularity in recent months: polls show the party close to or passing the 4% bar needed to obtain seats in Stockholm’s parliament. If the left leaning parties—with the Social Democratic party in the lead—secure enough votes and the feminists get 4%, they will likely help form the next government.\\n\\nWith its slogan “Out with the racists, in with the feminists,” the party has broadened traditional feminist values to also fight discrimination on the basis of race, sexual identity and physical disabilities. The party has grown from about 1,500 members in January to more than 17,000 members in July, said Gudrun Schyman, party leader and one of the founders of Feministiskt Initiativ.\\n\\n“We haven’t reached the goals when it comes to gender equality,” Schyman said. “There has been a myth that we are so advanced, that we have come so far in Sweden that we don’t have to talk about it, we don’t have to do anything.”\\n\\nWhile Sweden ranks number four in the 2013 Global Gender Gap Index, which measures equality in the areas of economics, politics, education and health, 95% of Swedish top leaders in listed companies are men. Recent studies also show that Swedish women have 85% of men’s wages and 66% of their pensions.\\n\\nSweden is also known for its groundbreaking laws on maternity and paternity leave. But the feminist say that more reforms are needed to make parental leave equal and they propose it should be individualized to fit all kinds of families, including transgender and same-sex ones. While parents are entitled to 480 days of paid leave and the days can be split between parents, a 2012 study shows that dads took only 24% of the total leave.\\n\\nSchyman, 66, says that the feminist party’s success is due to a carefully crafted door-to-door campaign: during the last twelve months, Schyman visited every Swedish home where the host pledged to gather a crowd of at least 25 people. During the two-hour long meetings, Schyman would talk about the growing racism in Swedish society, the need for better pensions and equal pay. The party also plans to set up an equality ministry as a permanent government organ. These talking points resonated strongly with a group of Swedish society—where 16% of the population is foreign-born, a higher percentage than in the U.S.—that feels alienated by more established parties.\\n\\nFeminist Initiativ also gained attention by riding a wave of anti-racist feelings that have emerged after increasingly anti-immigration parties, like Sverigedemokraterna, began to gain seats in the national parliament in the 2010 election.\\n\\nFeministiskt Initiativ has also had success in European politics. In May, the feminists got 5.3% of the Swedes’ votes and a Roma woman, Soraya Post, was welcomed as the first member of a feminist party to sit in the European parliament.\\n\\nSchyman believes her party can spur a movement throughout Scandinavia and Europe: she hopes that by 2019, the year of the next European Parliament election, there will be enough feminist voters in other European countries to form a European Feminist party group. Poland, Germany, France and Italy are among countries that already have organized feminist parties in their individual states.\\n\\nYasmine Ergas, director of the gender and public policy specialization at the school of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University, says it makes sense that a feminist party has so much support in Sweden.\\n\\n“The most important thing is to have the ability to mobilize consent,” Ergas said. “There must be a degree of consent in the society about the idea that women rights needs further approach and I think Sweden has that.”\\n\\nBut Feministiskt Initiativ has been criticized for being a populist party or for attracting voters with easy slogans that aren’t backed by financially sounded policy plans. Ebba Busch and Mikael Oscarsson, members of the conservative party Kristdemokraterna, wrote in an opinion piece in the Swedish newspaper Upsala nya Tidning that the feminist party has “totalitarian features” and that the party “proposes expenses of hundreds of millions Swedish Kronor without any kind of financial strategy.”\\n\\nAmong the propositions in the feminist party’s economic plan is a reduction of the workday from eight to six hours. Such reform would cost the Swedish government up to $1.6 billion during a ten-year long transition period, according to data published by the feminist party. In addition, the feminists propose free public transport, extensive efforts to stop domestic violence and an equality fund of $2 billion to speed up the equal pay process. These reforms will largely be funded by increased taxes but also by measures such as reduction of funding to the Swedish military.\\n\\n“When the welfare system is not working it affects women very much,” Schyman said. ”and we think it’s quite normal that you take responsibility for this all of you no matter if you are rich or not and if you have a lot of money you can pay some more tax.”\\n\\nRecent polls seem to side with Feminist Initiativ, pointing to a likely change in government from the current right-wing coalition Alliansen towards a government led by the Social Democrats and the green party. To get a majority in the parliament, the next administration is likely to cooperate with the feminists, and last week Schyman went public with her intent to back the Socialdemocrat leader Stefan Löfven as prime minister if they pass the 4% bar in the election on Sunday.\\n\\nThis summer, during the political rally in Almedalen in Visby the feminists rallied the crowds at Saint Karin’s ruin, a desolated church from the 14th century. Their “Anti-racist celebration” was held the same day as Jimmie Åkesson, party leader of anti -immigrant party Sverigedemokraterna spoke in front of the crowds a couple of hundreds of meters (656 ft.) away.\\n\\nHundreds of supporters—donning pink balloons and clothing, the color of the party—came to rally in favor of Feministiskt Initiativ. The renowned Swedish rapper Behrang Miri also performed to a crowd of hundreds.\\n\\n“We have the possibility to show that it is possible to get these ideas going in the parliament and in people’s minds,” said Bengt Örtegren, 68, member and volunteer at Feministiskt Initiativ. “I think that is the most important really that there will be new processes going in people’s minds. “\\n\\nFor him violence against women was one of the main reasons to join the party. “In all the world there is a lot of violence and oppression against women and that is a big issue,” he said. “Perhaps the biggest.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'From Nicki Minaj’s defiant twerking to Taylor Swift’s sly role-reversal to Beyoncé singing with the word “FEMINIST” emblazoned behind her, empowered women stole the spotlight at this year’s MTV Video Music Awards. Not only were their performances the best (sorry, Usher), but their message was clear:\\n\\nWe’re taking over. And we’re not sorry.\\n\\nWhen Nicki Minaj’s “Anaconda” video dropped last week, bloggers couldn’t help but notice that not a single man appeared in the video—except for Drake at the very end. (And let’s be fair: His mere presence is justified by her pleasure in teasing him.) Minaj has always done what she wants whenever she wants without any consideration for anyone, let alone the opposite gender. The same is true in this video—all that glorious twerking in the jungle isn’t for the sake of a man but for Minaj herself. And even when Minaj does proceed to give Drake a lap dance at the end of the video, it’s all on her terms. When he finally tries to reach out to touch her bottom, she slaps his hand and struts away, leaving him miserable with his head in his hands.\\n\\nHer VMAs performance was similar: all her backup dancers were female. And while she didn’t get the chance to utter some of the more choice lines from “Anaconda,” her dancing alone gives us the sense that Minaj could not care less what any man thinks.\\n\\nView the full performance here.\\n\\nTaylor Swift, who recently declared herself a feminist, eschewed tradition in her “Shake It Off” performance. In an interesting role reversal, all of Swift’s backup dancers were men while women sang backup and played instruments. It’s not a completely original move: many divas have been carried onstage by an entourage of men before. But when Swift was given the option to jump off a platform into the arms of the guys below her, she decided to walk down the stairs herself instead. The move was a nod to her clumsiness, but T-Swift was also sending the message that she doesn’t need to depend on a man to catch her either.\\n\\nView the full performance here.\\n\\nIggy Azalea & Rita Ora\\n\\nFor those who haven’t seen the music video for “Black Widow,” it’s a re-imagining of Kill Bill, one of the most iconic female empowerment flicks ever made. (And reminiscent of when Lady Gaga and Beyoncé teamed up for the “Telephone” music video, referencing Kill Bill as well as Thelma & Louise). The song has similar themes of women-on-man vengeance, and the music video—along with the VMAs performance—celebrates girl power in a way rarely seen in pop culture. Heck, maybe Iggy Azalea should play Spider-Woman on the big screen.\\n\\nView the full performance here.\\n\\nI’ve written before about how Beyoncé’s latest album, “Beyoncé,” is basically a lesson in modern feminism. That continued to be true Sunday night during her finale performance when she sang the anthems that women across the world have had on repeat since the surprise album drop in December. These are songs that remind women not to obsess about looks and perfection (“Flawless”), sexual pleasure ought to be a two-way street (“Blow”) and pleasing your man isn’t an anti-feminist endeavor (“Partition”).\\n\\nBut the peak came during “Flawless,” which began with the recording of Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s call to feminism (which is also featured in the album). Her words flashed in bold letters behind the singer: “We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are. We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller. We say to girls, you can have ambition but not too much. Aim to be successful, but not too successful otherwise you will threaten the man.”\\n\\nThe word “feminist” then flashed on the screen and lingered long enough for Beyonce’s silhouette to pull into the frame—and for her to be photographed with the words behind her a few thousand times.\\n\\nThink about that: feminist sat written in huge letters on a screen behind the most popular pop star in the world on an awards show whose main demographic is tweens and teens. The 2013 VMAs may have been the year of performances that gave us pause for all of the wrong reasons, but this year’s VMAs were something completely different.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Engagement rings, veils and white dresses are reportedly falling by the wayside\\n\\nA recent study conducted by online wedding directory WeddingDays.co.uk surveyed 200 soon-to-be-brides and concluded that “feminist weddings” are on the rise, with 26 percent of those surveyed planning to keep their maiden name in some form. But recent studies — including one conducted by Facebook this spring with 14 million married female participants — indicate that the survey’s conclusions are debatable at best.\\n\\nOf the 14 million women included in the study, which Facebook conducted in partnership with The Daily Beast, 65 percent of women changed their name on the social media site, and that number leaves out those who might have neglected to update their name change. The old-fashioned trend is being spearheaded by the youngest generation, too — women who marry in their mid to late thirties were 6.4 times more likely to keep their maiden names than 20 to 24-year-old brides, according to a 2011 study published in Names: A Journal of Onomastics.\\n\\nAnother study, conducted by TheKnot in 2011 of 19,000 women, found that only eight percent of brides decided to keep their maiden names — down from 23 percent in the nineties, when the trend peaked. The nineties were rife with conversation about weddings and feminism. In a now-famous 1987 op-ed piece for The New York Times, writer Anna Quindlen penned “The Name is Mine,” meditating on her choice to keep hold of her original name. The decision was for political and professional reasons, but Quindlen wrote about the feeling of separation in a family with two last names. “Now, there are two me’s, the me who is the individual and the me who is part of a family of four, a family of four in which, in a small way, I am left out,” she wrote.\\n\\nThe Wedding Days survey also claimed that other wedding trappings such as engagement rings, veils and white dresses were falling by the wayside. The conclusions aren’t all wrong, though. White dresses, which connote virginity, seem to be falling out of fashion in favor of pink or black. Oscar De La Renta and Vera Wang have recently debuted non-white wedding dress collections, and celebrities like Reese Witherspoon, Jessica Biel and Anne Hathaway have been opting for pink dresses on their big days in the last few years.\\n\\nA feminist decision? Maybe. Or perhaps the brides think they look pretty in pink.',\n",

       "  'text': 'From its early beginnings, feminism was a young women’s movement. Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Alice Paul, Charlotte Lozier and so many others began their suffragist work in their 20s. These women — the original feminists — understood that the rights of women cannot be built on the broken backs of unborn children. Anthony called abortion “child murder.” Paul, author of the original 1923 Equal Rights Amendment, said that “abortion is the ultimate exploitation of women.”\\n\\nSo the pro-life movement hasn’t changed the meaning of feminism, as has been suggested. It was the neo-feminists of the 1960s and ’70s who asked women to prize abortion as the pathway to equality.\\n\\n(MORE: Has the Fight For Abortion Rights Been Lost?)\\n\\nMarjorie Dannenfelser, along with a group of mostly Democratic women, started the Susan B. Anthony List in 1992, the so-called Year of the Woman, when numerous pro-choice women were elected to Congress. Dannenfelser, then in her mid-20s, saw a need to support more pro-life women running for elected office. Twenty years since the organization’s founding, we now have two pro-life women in the Senate, 17 in the House, four in governorships and hundreds more in state legislatures.\\n\\nPro-life feminism has captivated a new generation of young women who reject the illusion that to be pro-woman is to be pro-choice. Gallup polling showed that among 18-to-29-year-olds, there was a 5% increase in those labeling themselves “pro-life” between 2007–08 and 2009–10. The past few years have seen the emergence of young leaders like Kristan Hawkins of Students for Life of America, who is responsible for organizing more than 675 pro-life groups on college campuses across the nation, and Lila Rose of Live Action, whose undercover video work has forced the abortion industry to confront and amend practices it cannot defend, as well as dozens of other future leaders who have assisted our organization as staff members and interns. During the past two summers we’ve had young female leaders join the SBA List from Stanford, Georgetown, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and the University of California, Berkeley. These passionate defenders of women and unborn children return to their campuses ready to lead pro-life groups and educate their classmates on the tragedy of abortion.\\n\\n(MORE: Why Radical Pro-Lifers Are Wasting Their Time)\\n\\nNot only does this young generation of pro-life women shun the notion that abortion somehow liberates women; it views abortion as the civil- and human-rights cause of our day. Abortion is an injustice that permeates our society. Forty years after Roe v. Wade, we realize that a third of our peers are not here to share our progress and our hopes. It is our loss as well as theirs.\\n\\nIn his letter from a Birmingham, Ala., jail, Martin Luther King Jr. wrote, “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.” It is in this same spirit of King and the original feminists that young pro-life women are rising up in increasing numbers to say abortion is a radical injustice that affects us all and must end. Achieving this will require more efforts to extend our understanding of the equal rights of the disabled unborn, prevent rape and make this crime against women a thing of the past, expand adoption and make the benefits of modern prenatal care and specialties like fetal surgery more available, so that even younger and sicker children can be spared an early death.\\n\\nOur fight transcends elections and legislative battles because our fight is in our hearts. This is why, 40 years after Roe, our movement is still growing. We won’t give up; we can’t give up. Our fight is for life.\\n\\nMORE: Read TIME’s cover story, “What Choice?” by Kate Pickert',\n",

IPod bearing, second-generation techies faced insults in Silicon Valley parking lots; schoolgirls wearing head scarves were attacked; and mosques across the country were vandalized or set ablaze. For many months, it seemed altogether unclear whether America\\'s Muslims \\x97 from the cocktail-swilling secular to the mosque-attending pious \\x97 would ever live in their communities without apprehension again.\\n\\nThat tense period, the Harvard academic Leila Ahmed provocatively argues in a new book, has turned out to have been a very good thing. Its long term effect has been to remake American Islam, making the country\\'s most conservative Muslims tolerant of criticism and open to a young generation\\'s more liberal demands. The result, Ahmed writes in A Quiet Revolution, is no less than a \"new moment in history \\x97 in the history of Islam as well as of America.\" (Watch \"A Voice Behind the Veil: Planning to Defy a French Law.\")\\n\\nRaised in Egypt in the 1940s and now a scholar at Harvard Divinity School, Ahmed arrives at this conclusion by way of tracing the history of the veil. The bare-headed women of her Cairo girlhood considered veiling an outmoded habit of a repressive past, but by the early 1990s the majority of Muslim women around the world were once again covering up. Ahmed, like most well-heeled Muslims, is initially dismayed by this and sets out to understand why. The story behind the veil\\'s resurgence is not particularly straight-forward: everything plays a role, from British colonialism, the rise of Islamism in the Middle East, Egypt\\'s sclerotic economy, the Arab enmity with Israel, the Cold War and Saudi Arabia\\'s coffers.\\n\\nWhat Ahmed wants us to understand through this panoramic history is that the veil has gone through the wash cycle of history, and that its meaning today is both fresh and local. It is no longer a bandanna version of the all-encompassing Afghan burqa, signaling a woman\\'s brainwashed submissiveness or at the very least her lack of choice. Today, Ahmed argues, the veil often reflects values and attitudes that have little to do with piety at all. Many young women in post 9/11 America, she notes, began wearing the veil to protest discrimination against Muslims or to express their solidarity with the Palestinian cause.\\n\\nThe portrait of post 9/11 Muslim America that Ahmed offers up in her book is strikingly hopeful, full of individuals, trends, and stories that make her case for this new era\\'s promise. There is the feminist translation of the Koran that makes a sound case against domestic violence, the campaigns to move the women\\'s sections of mosques out of basements, the accounts of major conventions where Muslim authorities offer critics a platform to lambast their faith. Ahmed is direct about how this evolution came about: under attack in the era of after 9/11, \"Muslims found themselves an embattled minority needing the support of others,\" she writes. The new openness, she concludes, will be transforming. Even if Muslim authorities and elders are merely putting up a facade of liberality to ward off political attack, the climate is shaping a young generation of Muslims who demand more progressive ways as their due.\\n\\nI moderated a panel with Ahmed in London last month before a sold-out audience eager to hear and challenge her views. The section of her book dealing with the veil and world politics, particularly her position that the modern furor in the West over the veil replays old colonialist rhetoric, resonated with many. Resentment of British involvement in both Iraq and Afghanistan runs high in Britain, and Ahmed taps into that strain of public opinion by noting that saving Afghan women from the burqa became a moral short-hand for the West going to war in Afghanistan. (Islamophobia: Does America Have a Muslim Problem?)\\n\\nThe audience grew sharper and more skeptical, though, when it came to Ahmed\\'s rosy assertion that the veil\\'s resurgence dovetails with a feminist spirit of activism and justice. Some questioned whether it even made sense to discuss the veil so sweepingly when the climates in which women wore it \\x97 from Connecticut to Karachi \\x97 varied so dramatically in terms of women\\'s political, cultural, and economic status. More than one angry British feminist rebuked Ahmed for trying to honey-coat a covering that to many will always symbolize Islam\\'s patriarchy. The exchanges reflected the veil\\'s reliable ability to lead into passionate argument about more relevant subjects: Muslim immigrants\\' troubled assimilation in Europe, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and racism.\\n\\nAhmed\\'s book, and the veil itself, will doubtlessly continue sparking debate. But between the pages, laced into Ahmed\\'s account of the veil in history, the curious will find gems of scholarship and insight. Saudi Arabia\\'s shadow looms long across the book, and the kingdom emerges as the quiet victor in the veil\\'s resurgence, its long-time project to export Wahhabi Islam\\'s more strict ways a global success. Most striking of all, we learn that conservative Muslims, or veiled Muslims for that matter, make up a decided minority in America. The rest are discretely living their lives, either secular or private in their practice of Islam, a silent majority receiving no one\\'s attention.\\n\\nSee TIME\\'s photo-essay \"Muslim in America.\"\\n\\nSee TIME\\'s photo-essay \"30 Mosques in 30 Days.\"',\n",

       "  'text': 'After several well-publicized cases involving athletes from the National Football League, the past few weeks have been flush with conversations about violence against women and how to end it.\\n\\nOn Saturday, actress Emma Watson, best known as Hermione Granger from the “Harry Potter” movies, delivered a moving speech before the United Nations. Watson, a goodwill ambassador for U.N. Women, introduced a new campaign called HeForShe aimed at getting men involved as active participants in stopping violence against women.\\n\\nWatson name-checked former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton in her speech, referencing the former first lady’s 1995 speech before the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, where Clinton declared, “It is no longer acceptable to discuss women’s rights as separate from human rights.”\\n\\nWatson noted that, at the time, only about 30 percent of the audience Clinton addressed was male. “How can we effect change in the world when only half of it is invited or feel welcome to participate in the conversation?” she asked. “Men — I would like to take this opportunity to extend your formal invitation. Gender equality is your issue, too.”\\n\\nThis is a message that is starting to resonate in the culture at large. While women such as CNN’s Rachel Nichols and ESPN’s Hannah Storm criticized the NFL for its response to Ray Rice and other instances of NFL player-involved domestic abuse, they were joined by CBS Sports anchor James Brown, who passionately and eloquently informed viewers “this is yet another call to men to stand up and take responsibility for their thoughts, their words, their deeds and, as Deion [Sanders] says, to give help or to get help, because our silence is deafening and deadly.”\\n\\nWatson’s message echoed that of organizations such as Men Can Stop Rape that recognize the need to enlist and involve male allies in ending violence against women. For men, it means speaking up when your boy trashes a woman with gender-based epithets, or when he brags about taking advantage of a woman who was too intoxicated to consent to sex, or when you know he’s engaging in violent behavior toward a woman.\\n\\nOften, conversations about sexual assault revolve around what women should do to prevent it — don’t dress a certain way, don’t leave your house alone during certain hours, don’t jog with your headphones turned up too loudly, don’t leave your drink unattended, don’t drink to excess in the company of men, and on and on and on.\\n\\nBut, say many activists, this sort of rhetoric shifts responsibility from perpetrator to victim. Instead of teaching men and boys that intimate partner violence is unacceptable — and that they play an active role in stopping and preventing it — it communicates that women and girls are responsible for their own attacks. This messaging is what campaigns such as the 2011 Slut Walks were attempting to upend. It’s why there’s a student at Columbia University dragging a mattress wherever she goes on campus until the university does something about her rape.\\n\\n“The more I have spoken about feminism, the more I have realized that fighting for women’s rights has too often become synonymous with man-hating,” Watson said. “If there is one thing I know for certain, it is that this has to stop. For the record, feminism, by definition, is the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities. It is the theory of the political, economic and social equality of the sexes.”\\n\\nBut that wasn’t the totality of Watson’s message. Her other point: that patriarchy is detrimental for men, too:\\n\\nI’ve seen young men suffering from mental illness unable to ask for help for fear it would make them look less “macho” — in fact in the U.K., suicide is the biggest killer of men between 20 to 24, eclipsing road accidents, cancer and coronary heart disease. I’ve seen men made fragile and insecure by a distorted sense of what constitutes male success. Men don’t have the benefits of equality either.\\n\\nWe don’t often talk about men being imprisoned by gender stereotypes, but I can see that they are — and that when they are free, things will change for women as a natural consequence.\\n\\nIf men don’t have to be aggressive in order to be accepted, women won’t feel compelled to be submissive. If men don’t have to control, women won’t have to be controlled.\\n\\nBoth men and women should feel free to be sensitive. Both men and women should feel free to be strong. … It is time that we all perceive gender on a spectrum, not as two opposing sets of ideals. If we stop defining each other by what we are not and start defining ourselves by what we are — we can all be freer. And this is what HeForShe is about. It’s about freedom.\\n\\nSoraya Nadia McDonald covers arts, entertainment and culture for the Washington Post with a focus on race and gender issues.\\n\\nSECTION: {section=national, subsection=null}!!!

       "  'text': 'Posted by Suzi Parker on February 8, 2013 at 9:01 am\\n\\n“Feminism” is not a dirty word.\\n\\nBut some people think it is. A staffer at Beliefnet, a spirituality, inspiration and emotional wellness Web site, told Minnesota playwright Kristine Holmgren that readers had issues with the word “feminism.”\\n\\nHolmgren, who planned to use in the word in the title of her new blog for the site, shared an email from Beliefnet’s marketing and business analyst Sharon Kirk with media writer Jim Romensko on his Web site.\\n\\n“\\xadI would suggest changing the tag line or deleting all together as I’m concerned about the negative connotation that our readers may associate with the word feminism,” the email read. “In addition, we’ll want this blog to focus more on Christianity/spirituality as opposed to issues related to feminism. What do you think of simply ‘Sweet Truths with Kristine Holmgren’?”\\n\\nHolmgren, who is also a Presbyterian pastor, told Kirk, “Please phone me.” In their ensuing discussion, Holmgren says, she asked whether Kirk was troubled by the word “feminist.” No, Kirk reportedly answered, but the Web site’s readers were. Holgren then told the Web site she didn’t want to write for it.\\n\\nHave conservatives so corrupted the word “feminist” that is now tainted like the word like “liberal” or “environmentalist”? The fact that this is even in the realm of discussion in 2013 makes my head ache terribly — and makes me angry.\\n\\nFeminism, in its simplest definition, means women – and men who align with that philosophy – who want equal rights for women. Who believe women should have equal pay, legal, voting, education and reproductive rights and protection from domestic violence, sexual assault and harassment. And no, you don’t have be a militant and burn your bra to be a feminist. But you can if you want to.\\n\\nWhen I was growing up, my mother, who was of the generation where women married after high school, took their husband’s name and had babies, always told me that I could do anything a boy could do. I sometimes doubted that in the 1970s South, when girls were still dressing in frills to attend cotillion and enter beauty pageants. But I gave it my best shot. I skateboarded, popped wheelies on my bike and played baseball – not softball – with the neighborhood boys. And like the boys, I suffered skinned knees and bruised arms (mine were visible when I wore my sundresses). I felt equal, if not at times better, than they were.\\n\\nSome 20-something, millennial women say that feminism has corrupted their femininity and their wish to stay at home and raise children. Not at all. Feminism is about the opportunity for a woman to choose whatever path in her life she wants, but, also to have the same rights as her male counterparts, whether in the boardroom or the bedroom. If men feel intimidated by this modernity, it’s their problem.\\n\\nThe tainting of the word “feminism” has a lot to do with Rush Limbaugh, who has made it his mission for the last 20 years to try and put women in their proper place. In the early 1990s, he repeatedly used the term “feminazi,” a slur to describe a dozen or so women – Gloria Steinem, Anita Hill and Susan Sarandon – whom he found repulsive for their beliefs. Limbaugh later adopted the term to describe any woman who supported abortion rights or, essentially, who he didn’t like.\\n\\nNot many years ago, the term “queer” was used as anti-gay hate speech. But many millennials have embraced that word, and added “Q” to LGBT to break down boundaries. Popular television shows such as “Queer Eye” and “Queer Folk” have even adopted the term in a positive way.\\n\\nKudos to Holmgren for standing her ground on “feminism.” In the ongoing war on women in this country and around the world, it’s time to take back the word proudly.\\n\\nSuzi Parker is an Arkansas-based political and cultural journalist and author of “Sex in the South: Unbuckling the Bible Belt.” Follow her on Twitter at @SuziParker',\n",

       "  'text': 'We are in the midst of a sexual revolution at work. Thanks in part to the recession, women now hold close to half of all jobs in the economy, mothers are the main or co-breadwinners in two-thirds of American families, and men can claim the dubious honor of being a majority of the jobless. But this is one sexual revolution that hasn\\'t produced much joy of late -- at work or at home. For many, decent wages and economic security remain elusive, and the stress of long hours and job competition has frayed social relationships.\\n\\nThe American workplace is transforming, but women\\'s lives aren\\'t necessarily improving. If we\\'d known what it was like to have it all, as Lily Tomlin might say, we would have asked for something else.\\n\\nThe answer is not for women to leave the workforce -- as if that were even a remote possibility. But neither is it to resurrect the feminism of the 1960s generation and refight the battles of the past half-century. In recent weeks, the vitriol stirred up by the health-care reform amendment from Rep. Bart Stupak (D-Mich.) that would restrict insurance coverage for abortion has highlighted the divide among women, many of whom consider themselves both Democrats and feminists, over how to focus feminist efforts. It is painfully clear that consensus in this country on the issue of abortion rights is impossible at this moment.\\n\\nFeminism today should concentrate on the economy and the workplace -- and on the huge transformations that are needed there to get greater equality and security. These are issues that can unite women across class and culture and allow feminism to speak to the fears and concerns of everyone. A few women\\'s organizations and groups have been moving in this direction for a long time. But what often gets lost is how much we can draw not only from the great feminist upsurge of the late 1960s and 1970s but also from the movement that preceded it. The next women\\'s movement should look a lot more like the one in the 1930s than the one in the late 1960s.\\n\\nYes, there was a feminist movement before Betty Friedan published \"The Feminine Mystique\" in 1963. Back in those dark days before \"women\\'s liberation,\" our mothers, grandmothers and great-grandmothers had some brilliant ideas about how to improve the lives of working women as well as how to fix the economy. They were what I call New Deal feminists, who led the women\\'s movement during the \"long New Deal\" from the 1930s to the 1960s.\\n\\nThey survived the Great Depression, kept factories humming during the war years and pioneered the now-commonplace status of working wife and mother. They knew first-hand about job loss, careers on hold and the competing demands of family and workplace, all problems we still face. Their solutions were partial, but the policies they put forward concerning fair wages and family-friendly laws and workplaces -- all crucial elements in addressing our current economic insecurity and inequality -- are a foundation upon which we can build.\\n\\nWhat did they achieve? Well, not exactly what they wanted, but then neither does any generation. What they wanted was not just more jobs but better jobs; not just the right to work but rights at work; not just equal pay but the revaluing of women\\'s work, paid and unpaid, wherever it occurred -- in the family, in the community, on the factory floor, in the boardroom, at the day-care center or the nursing home; and Social Security and health care not just for some but for all.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t enough for women to gain access to what had traditionally been men\\'s work. All too often that meant entering dangerous or poorly paid jobs and adjusting to a work world premised on the ideal of an unencumbered wage-earner without home or community responsibilities. Rather, what was needed, they argued, was to transform the world of work, its values and its practices.\\n\\nFrances Perkins, who served as President Franklin Roosevelt\\'s labor secretary from 1933 to 1945, and other female social reformers who came of age in the early 20th century helped shape the initial New Deal legislation of the 1930s. A younger generation of feminists soon took up the baton, working tirelessly in the 1940s and 1950s to secure changes in employer and government policies that would ease the economic and social insecurity plaguing the nation and address unfair practices at work.\\n\\nThese included Kentucky farm girl-turned-auto plant organizer Caroline Dawson Davis, the powerhouse behind the women\\'s department of the United Auto Workers from 1948 to 1973; Addie Wyatt, a prominent Chicago civil rights and packinghouse-union leader; and hospitality-worker advocate Myra Wolfgang, who organized Playboy bunnies and publicly reprimanded Hugh Hefner for perpetuating the idea that \"women should be obscene and not heard.\"\\n\\nBy the early 1960s, with one of their own, Esther Peterson -- a Utah-born Mormon who in the 1930s found her life\\'s cause in supporting the workplace struggles of low-income women -- the highest-ranking woman in the Kennedy administration, their ideas moved to the national stage. Peterson convinced John F. Kennedy to set up the President\\'s Commission on the Status of Women in 1961, and its report, \"American Women,\" a national bestseller, embodied much of the reformers\\' vision. A number of its recommendations -- equal pay for equal work, for example -- would become law; many others made headway but then lost steam as the country turned its attention elsewhere. Now it\\'s time to retrieve these forgotten, far-sighted feminists.\\n\\nTake their jobs program. They wanted neither the dole nor make-work. Rather, they wanted more good jobs. Good jobs meant, first and foremost, higher pay. What better way to prime the economic pump than to put money in the pockets of workers, who after all are consumers? Female workers in particular needed a raise. They too supported families, they too provided essential services, even if the results were more intangible than in traditional men\\'s work: a child who could read, a sick patient comforted.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa in \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" (The Associated Press)\\n\\nThe inhospitable desert landscape of \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" isn\\'t so different from today\\'s Hollywood: Low on water and overrun by men.\\n\\nBut amid the overflowing testosterone of \"Fury Road,\" George Miller\\'s sequel to his post-apocalyptic franchise, Charlize Theron dramatically stands out. While \"Mad Max\" may star Tom Hardy as the titular road warrior of \"Fury Road,\" it is effectively Theron\\'s film.\\n\\nShe plays Furiosa, a warrior with a shaved head and prosthetic arm, attempting to rescue a harem of wives held captive by a warlord.\\n\\n\"When people first started talking about this film, this loud whisper went around town that George was looking to create a female character that can stand next to Max and carry the journey with him,\" Theron said in a recent interview. \"For a female actress, that always sounds intriguing. Look, we hear it all the time and very few filmmakers see that through.\"\\n\\nClick here to subscribe to FOX411’s YouTube channel\\n\\n\"Fury Road,\" which was to receive a premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on Thursday before opening in theaters Friday, is an atypical summer action movie — essentially a two-hour car chase — that\\'s literally and effectively driven by a strong woman.\\n\\nLately, a chorus of actresses has spoken out about what they\\'ve called inherent sexism in Hollywood and the lack of quality female roles. Meryl Streep, Carey Mulligan, Kristen Stewart and Patricia Arquette have all recently made strong statements about gender inequality in the industry. And on Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union asked U.S. state and federal agencies to investigate what it claimed is widespread gender discrimination in Hollywood.\\n\\n\"It\\'s crazy that we live in a world, not just in Hollywood, where women get paid less than men for doing the same job,\" says Theron. \"And also just the representation of women in film, it hasn\\'t been that authentic and true. So when something comes along where women are represented in a truthful manner, all of a sudden, people really respond to it. And it\\'s kind of like, \\'You guys, this isn\\'t anything new.\\'\"\\n\\nChanneling some rage into Furiosa came naturally: \"There were emotional things that I could connect to.\"\\n\\nSome have even described \"Fury Road\" as a feminist film. \"Vagina Monologues\" writer Eve Ensler consulted on the movie, working with the actresses playing the enslaved wives.\\n\\n\"Feminism is such a tricky thing to throw around because I don\\'t think a lot of people know what women mean when they speak in that articulation,\" says Theron. \"Really, what it boils down to is just equal rights.\"\\n\\nTheron stuck with \"Fury Road\" through years of delays as shooting shifted from Miller\\'s native Australia to Namibia. It was a lengthy shoot, followed by extensive reshoots the next year. Theron acknowledges it was a sometimes trying production, but her commitment to the character is clear enough: Theron shaved off her blonde hair for the role.\\n\\n\"It wasn\\'t that we were trying to hide her as a female,\" says Theron. \"She had to almost disappear in this environment and everybody had to get to a place where they almost forgot that she was a woman. And I just didn\\'t know how to do that with a ponytail.\"',\n",

       "  'text': 'Norman Vincent Peale, author of \"The Power of Positive Thinking,\" once wrote these words: “Change your thoughts, and you change your world.”\\n\\nHis statement is highlighted at the beginning of my new book, \"How to Choose a Husband and Make Peace with Marriage.\" Its premise is that if women want to be successful in love, they should reject the cultural script they’ve been sold and adopt a whole new view of men and marriage.\\n\\nAs products of divorce, the modern generation has few role models for lasting love. That alone is a problem. But young women have an added burden: they’ve been raised in a society that eschews marriage. They’ve been taught instead to honor sex, singlehood and female empowerment.\\n\\nConsider this statement by Rebecca Traister in Marie Claire: “The world as we’ve known it for a very long time—one in which a woman’s value was tied to her role as a wife—is ending, right in front of us. It is now standard for a woman to spend years on her own, learning, working, earning, socializing, having sex, and yes, having babies in the manner she—and she alone—sees fit. We are living through the invention of independent female adulthood.”\\n\\nThis message is not an anomaly; the idea that women don’t need men or marriage is palpable. It began in earnest more than forty years ago, with the modern feminist movement. Feminists assured women their efforts would result in more satisfying marriages, but the result is something else altogether. It looks something like this:\\n\\n1. Women postpone marriage indefinitely and move in and out of intense romantic relationships, or even live with their boyfriends for years at a time. Eventually, their biological clocks start ticking and many decide they better hurry up and get married to provide a stable home for their yet-to-be-born children. Trouble is, their boyfriend’s not willing to commit.\\n\\n2. Marriage becomes a competitive sport. The complementary nature of marriage—in which two people work together, as equals, toward the same goal but with an appreciation for the qualities each gender brings to the table—has been obliterated. Today, husbands and wives are locked in a battle about whom does more on the home front and how they’re going to get everything done. That’s not a marriage. That’s war.\\n\\nIt’s time to say what no one else will: Feminism didn’t result in equality between the sexes – it resulted in mass confusion. Today, men and women have no idea who’s supposed to do what.\\n\\nPrior to the 1970s, people viewed gender roles as as equally valuable. Many would argue women had the better end of the deal! It’s hard to claim women were oppressed in a nation in which men were expected to stand up when a lady enters the room or to lay down their lives to spare women life. When the Titanic went down in 1912, its sinking took 1,450 lives. Only 103 were women. One-hundred three.\\n\\nCompare that with last year’s wrecked cruise line, the Costa Concordia. It resulted in fewer deaths, but there was another significant difference. “There was no ‘women and children first’ policy. There were big men, crew members, pushing their way past us to get into the lifeboats. It was disgusting,” said passenger Sandra Rogers, 62.\\n\\nThe captain of the ship agrees. In USA Today, Francesco Schettino was asked about his New Year’s resolution. He responded, “Bone up on the parts about ‘women and children first’ and ‘the captain goes down with his ship.’”\\n\\nYou see, the problem with equality is that it implies two things are interchangeable – meaning one thing can be substituted for the other with no ramifications. That is what feminists would have us believe, and anyone who contradicts this dogma is branded sexist.\\n\\nBut the truth must be heard. Being equal in worth, or value, is not the same as being identical, interchangeable beings. Men and women may be capable of doing many of the same things, but that doesn’t mean they want to. That we don’t have more female CEOs or stay-at-home dads proves this in spades.\\n\\nUnless, of course, you’re beholden to feminism. In that case, you’ll believe the above is evidence of discrimination. You’ll believe what feminists taught you to believe: that gender is a social construct.\\n\\nThose of us with children know better. We know little girls love their dolls and boys just want to kick that ball. This doesn’t mean men can’t take care of babies or women can’t play sports. It just means each gender has its own energy that flows in a specific direction. For God’s sake, let it flow.\\n\\nThe battle of the sexes is over. And guess what? No one won. Why not try something else on for size? Like this: men and women are equal, but different. They’ve each been blessed with amazing and unique qualities that they bring to the table. Isn’t it time we stopped fussing about who brought what and simply enjoy the feast?\\n\\nSuzanne Venker has written extensively about politics, parenting, and the influence of feminism on American society. Her latest book, \"How to Choose a Husband and Make Peace with Marriage,\" is now available at Amazon.

       "  'text': 'Something I love about gymnastics is that it’s one of the few sports that is feminine by default. When we say “gymnastics,” we almost always mean “women’s gymnastics.” Though all the athletes who competed in gymnastics in the first modern Olympiad in Athens were men, the Platonic ideal of the gymnast has long been a woman (or rather, a girl).\\n\\nFrom Mary Lou Retton to Gabby Douglas, it’s women’s gymnastics that, every four years, captures the American imagination and whips up patriotic excitement. Men have more longevity in their branch of the sport, competing into their late 20s and mid-30s, whereas the women are often washed up by the time they can legally drink. (One notable exception is Oksana Chusovitina, who still competes for Uzbekistan at the geriatric-by-gymnastics-standards age of 41.)\\n\\nThe happy consequence is that gymnastics is one of the few sports where girls enjoy more prestige than grown men. In America, as Biles and her teammates are showing, they’re more likely to win gold and therefore achieve fame. They are also among that rare breed of female athletes who earn more from endorsements than the boys and men.\\n\\nMy coaches didn’t train boys, which meant that, apart from one or two male coaches, my training gym was a girl world. There, every surface wore a fine dusting of chalk, the dress code was leotard and bike shorts (matching scrunchie optional), and it was a given that girls were great athletes. In the gym, the strength of girls — our power, our resilience — was self-evident.\\n\\nFrom the age of 11, I was spending 21 hours a week in a place where girls, none of us older than 18, were indisputably athletic and where our abilities were never compared unfavorably to those of boys and men. By default, the sport was ours, and the gym felt like a refuge from a world that would always be someone else’s.\\n\\nFor some of us, at least. For others, the gym proved anything but a refuge from the predations of the world: Much later, I found out that one of our coaches, a man, had sexually abused several girls. USA Gymnastics, too, is now facing a reckoning after an investigation revealed that, for years, the governing body had ignored or suppressed allegations of sexual abuse.\\n\\nSpared of that, thankfully, I soon found my gymnastic metier. I was never much of a vaulter, and I lacked the explosive strength that makes a great tumbler. But high on the beam, which is barely four inches wide, I felt invincible.\\n\\nI relished the implausibility of contorting and catapulting my body in the air above this narrow little plank. I found joy in the exacting work of refining a muddled and terrified first attempt at a flip, doing it again and again until every finger and toe was in the right place and it wasn’t scary any more. And then a hundred more times, until the perfect version was committed to muscle memory.\\n\\nOf course, I wasn’t invincible. My dad’s hands shook on the camcorder for good reason. I was 8 or 9 the first time I took a nasty fall: I landed a leap wrong and fell with one leg on each side of the beam. The sandpapery covering, designed to make the beam easier to grip, scraped the skin off the insides of my legs before my pelvis slammed onto the apparatus.\\n\\nI slid off and toppled onto the mats, dazed, more in shock than in pain. A moment later, I climbed back up and did that leap again. My coach crouched down and looked me right in the eyes. “That,” she said, “is how I know you’re going to be a champion.”\\n\\nIt was the first hard fall of many, and if the gym was a reprieve from the world outside, it was also a rehearsal for it. Even before gymnastics did away with “the perfect 10” and replaced it with open-ended scoring, perfection was never truly possible. In gymnastics, as in life, we demand impossible perfection of girls, and punish them when they inevitably fail to achieve it.\\n\\nRecently, I took a drop-in gymnastics class in Manhattan. As I warmed up with the rest of the creaky-jointed adults, breathing in the old familiar smell of the foam mats, I watched the teenage girls finishing their practice session. Did we really used to do that? I asked myself. Was I ever that fearless?',\n",

       "  'text': 'HILLARY CLINTON’S securing of the Democratic nomination doesn’t just put a woman in range of the White House; it puts a mother there. And that’s momentous. Over the past half-century, unmarried childless women have overcome every barrier to opportunity you can think of, and now earn 96 percent of what men do. Mothers, on the other hand, aren’t doing nearly as well: Married mothers are paid 76 cents on the dollar.\\n\\nTo me, Mrs. Clinton’s sheer professional survival is as inspiring as any of her other accomplishments. A woman with a small child can easily lose faith that she’ll ever do anything else again. God knows I did. For the first five years of my child-rearing life, I was supposed to be writing a book, but mostly I dodged my editor’s calls. The 3-year-old had separation anxiety, so I waited it out on one of the nursery school’s kid-size chairs. I lacked the heart to say no to play dates, so I shut my computer and attended to juice boxes.\\n\\nThen there was Ladies’ Night, when the mothers on my cul-de-sac got together to drink too much wine. Fun, sure, but really: “Ladies’ Night”? The fact that I went every week proved that my professional viability was fast disappearing, or so I thought at the time.\\n\\nHow did Mrs. Clinton hold on to hers? How did she rebound from the years in which she was raising a daughter, pursuing a law career and serving as first lady of Arkansas? She has a steely will, as everyone knows. But another answer is that it was in many ways easier to be a working mother in 1980, when Chelsea Clinton was born, than it is today.\\n\\nBetween the ’80s and the aughts, when I had my children, a cloud of economic anxiety descended on parents, tightening what the sociologist Arlie Hochschild has called “the time bind.” The workweek of salaried professionals ballooned from 40 hours to 50 hours or more, not counting the email catch-up done after the kids’ bedtime. Union protections, predictable schedules and benefits vanished for vast numbers of blue-collar workers. Their jobs in the service or on-demand economies now pay so little, and child care costs so much (168 percent more than it did a quarter-century ago) that parents have to stitch together multiple jobs. Meanwhile, terrified that their offspring will sink even lower, parents siphon off time and money to hand-raise children who can compete in a global economy.\\n\\nWomen like me who scale back in the face of impossible expectations feel themselves morphing into caricatures: attachment freaks, helicopter moms, concerted cultivators, neo-traditionalists. These stereotypes are just plain sexist, but I don’t know many mothers whose careers, paychecks and sense of self-worth haven’t been eroded by all the compromises they’ve had to make. Our worlds have narrowed; our bank accounts have dipped below the minimum balance; and our power within the family and the world has dwindled. We’d be quick to tell you that we wouldn’t have done it any differently. Still.\\n\\nWhat if the world was set up in such a way that we could really believe — not just pretend to — that having spent a period of time concentrating on raising children at the expense of future earnings would bring us respect? And what if that could be as true for men as it is for women?\\n\\nWe live in an age rich in feminisms. One celebrates our multiplicity of identities: black, lesbian, transgender. Another has effectively anathematized sexual violence. Yet another — I think of it as C-suite feminism — chips away at the glass ceiling that keeps women out of the most powerful jobs, such as, say, the presidency.\\n\\nBut we need another feminism — and it needs a name that has nothing to do with gender. Let’s call it, for lack of a better term, “caregiverism.” It would demand dignity and economic justice for parents dissatisfied with a few weeks of unpaid parental leave, and strive to mitigate the sacrifices made by adult children responsible for aging parents.\\n\\nMrs. Clinton could be a champion of caregiverism. She has been blunter this electoral season about family-friendly policies than she has ever been before. She emphasized paid family leave when she began her campaign and again in the opening statements of the first Democratic presidential debate. In May, she said she’d cap the cost of child care at 10 percent of a household’s income, down from what, for a household supported by minimum-wage workers, can now be more than 30 percent.\\n\\nBut she needs to go further. Her focus is on wage-earners; what about the people who want to get out of the workplace, at least for a while? Mrs. Clinton should talk to Representative Nita Lowey of New York, who last year introduced a bill that would give Social Security credits to caregivers who left the labor market or cut back on hours — a public nod to the reality that care is work and caregivers merit the same benefits as other workers.\\n\\nMrs. Clinton belongs to an earlier generation, one whose objective was to free women from the prison of domesticity — at least the middle-class women who didn’t already have jobs — and send them marching into the work force to demand equality there. But true equality will take more than equal pay and better working conditions. It will require something more radical, a “transvaluation of all values,” in Nietzsche’s phrase.\\n\\nAm I calling for a counterrevolution? I don’t think so. Feminists have not always seen work as the answer to women’s problems. Many who put in sweatshop hours in the textile industry or open-ended days in domestic service fought for the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which established the 40-hour workweek. Working women “were not just organizable; they were the best constituency for struggle over the working day,” write David Roediger and Philip Foner in “Our Own Time: A History of American Labor and the Working Day.”\\n\\nThere is also a venerable tradition in feminist history of trying to overturn a status quo that esteems professionals and wage-earners while demeaning those who do the unpaid or low-paid work of emotional sustenance and physical upkeep. In the 1960s, the largely African-American National Welfare Rights Organization demanded welfare payments that would maintain a decent standard of living, partly on the grounds that these mothers were working already, raising future workers, and partly because they couldn’t find jobs that would support them. “I am 45 years old; I have raised six children,” wrote the group’s chairwoman, Johnnie Tillmon, in 1972. “A job doesn’t necessarily mean an adequate income. There are some 10 million jobs that now pay less than the minimum wage, and if you’re a woman, you’ve got the best chance of getting one.”\\n\\nAround the same time, the Marxist feminists Mariarosa Dalla Costa and Selma James began a campaign called Wages for Housework that called for the overthrow of a capitalist order subsidized, in their view, by the unpaid slog of homemaking and, yes, sexual services. This did not mean that women should necessarily go out and find jobs. “Not one of us believes that emancipation, liberation, can be achieved through work,” they wrote. “Slavery to an assembly line is not liberation from slavery to a kitchen sink.”\\n\\nLiberal feminists accused them of wanting to push women back into domestic drudgery, but they denied it. “We have worked enough,” they wrote. “We have chopped billions of tons of cotton, washed billions of dishes, scrubbed billions of floors, typed billions of words, wired billions of radio sets, washed billions of nappies, by hand and in machines.” So what did they want? I asked Silvia Federici, a founder of the New York chapter of Wages for Housework who writes prolifically on these questions. Actual wages for housework aside, she said, the movement wanted to make people ask themselves, “Why is producing cars more valuable than producing children?”\\n\\nThe expectation that all mothers will work has been especially hard on single mothers. When Franklin D. Roosevelt established the welfare program Aid to Dependent Children in 1935 it was a given that poor single mothers would tend to their young (poor single white mothers, I should say, because black women were expected to hold jobs). By the 1970s, that presumption having vanished, Ronald Reagan could argue that welfare mothers were “lazy parasites” and “pigs at the trough,” laying the groundwork for welfare reform.\\n\\nThe program put in place by Bill Clinton in 1996, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, cuts off benefits after five years or less; forces women to hold or look for jobs, whether or not there are any to be had; and allows states to shunt welfare funds into other programs. And so, from 1996 to 2011, the number of families living in extreme poverty — on $2 per person a day or less — more than doubled. A majority of those households were headed by single mothers.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The virtue of hope has been a leitmotif of Benedict XVIâ\\x80\\x99s papacy. He dedicated his second encyclical to the topic (Spe Salvi) and is making â\\x80\\x9cChrist Our Hopeâ\\x80\\x9d the theme of this his first visit to the United States. But fear, not hope, has been a predominant note in his major writings on feminism and the changing role of women in the Church and in the world. Unfortunately, fear begets fear. For their part, many women, both Catholics and non Catholics, express wariness about the Churchâ\\x80\\x99s positions on women. The are afraid, I think, that the Church will use its influence to reduce the opportunities for women to flourish, rather than to expand them.\\n\\nSo what does the Pope fear? In his â\\x80\\x9cLetter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Collaboration of Men and Women in the Church and in the Worldâ\\x80\\x9d (2004), written while he was still known as Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith., he express concern about two aspects of contemporary feminism. The first is a tendency for women to seek power in order to overcome unjust subjugation. This can lead to â\\x80\\x9copposition between men and women, in which the identity and role of one are emphasized to the disadvantage of the other.â\\x80\\x9d The second is a tendency to deny the fundamental nature of the differences between men and women, viewing those differences not as built into their very natures, but instead as â\\x80\\x9cmere effects of historical and cultural conditioning.â\\x80\\x9d Benedict worries that these tendencies have baleful effects on both the society and the church, particularly on the increasingly fragile traditional two parent family. He fears for a community that does not sufficiently appreciate the gift of children, and he fears for children who do not have both a mother and a father to raise them.\\n\\nIn response, the Letter advocates anthropology of collaboration between the sexes - not competition. Equally made in the image and likeness of God, men and women designed for partnership on every level, including the level of sexual relationship. They have different but complementary gifts. Women, in particular, have a â\\x80\\x9cfeminine geniusâ\\x80\\x9d that amounts to an expertise in â\\x80\\x9chuman relationships and caring for others.â\\x80\\x9d Respect for â\\x80\\x9cfeminine geniusâ\\x80\\x9d first of all means protecting and promoting the role of women in family life, because that is where human beings â\\x80\\x9clearn to love in as much as they are unconditionally loved.â\\x80\\x9d At the same time, Benedict does not want to restrict women to Kinder, KÃ¼che, Kirche (children, kitchen, church) â\\x80\\x93 he affirms that women â\\x80\\x9cshould have access to positions of responsibility which allow them to inspire the policies of nations and to promote innovative solutions to economic and social problems.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSo what do women fear when they hear this vision of their nature and their lives? Well, one might say, so to speak, that the devil is in the details. It is one thing to advocate complementary between men and women as a general matter. Itâ\\x80\\x99s an entirely different thing to start parceling out complementary character traits, which seems to be the very next step. Many attempts to do just this have been formulated in the past, by both Catholics and Protestants â\\x80\\x93 now, they seem both simplistic and sexist. Contemporary efforts have not been more successful. In her recent book New Woman (Circle Press), which boasts an introduction by current U.S. Ambassador to the Vatican Mary Ann Glendon, papal feminist Gloria Conde sets forth this account, from Judith Bartwick:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe â\\x80\\x9cmasculineâ\\x80\\x9d is equivalent to the objective, analytical, active, inclined to thought, rational, indomitable, interfering, one who obstructs, independent, self sufficient, emotionally controlled, and self assured. With his mind, the man distinguishes, analyzes, separates, and perfects. The â\\x80\\x9cfeminineâ\\x80\\x9d corresponds to the subjective, intuitive, passive, tender, sensitive, easily influenced, docile, receptive, empathetic, dependent, emotional, and conservative. Her mind picks up relations, she possesses intuitive perception of sentiments, and she tends to unite rather than divide.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis is exactly the sort of list that was once used by many people, not merely Catholics, to deny that women were fit to exercise the right to vote â\\x80\\x93 let alone to run for President of the United States (Hilary Clinton), or to serve as Chancellor of Germany (Angela Merkel). Focusing on the differences between men and women, it obscures the substantial abilities and concerns that they have in commonâ\\x80\\x93including rationality and self assurance, if my own female law students are any indication. Benedictâ\\x80\\x99s understanding of â\\x80\\x9cfeminine genius,â\\x80\\x9d first coined by Pope John Paul II, easily embraces the tender qualities necessary to be a mother to small children. But it does not so clearly stretch to include even the firmness necessary to be a mother to adolescents in todayâ\\x80\\x99s world, or the resilience necessary to many women who must struggle to raise children alone, or in politically uncertain or impoverished situations.\\n\\nIs there a way beyond the fear to find a common hope? It seems to me that a good first step would be to move beyond abstractions to address concrete challenges together. It is harder, after all, to fear those with whom one works together for the common good. Pope Benedict has extolled the role of Mary as the perfect womanâ\\x80\\x93both virgin and mother. As every Catholic who ever prayed the Salve Regina knows, Mary points beyond her own perfection to the sufferings of the whole world, to the tears and sighs of the \"poor banished children of Eve.\"\\n\\nWho, concretely, are the poor banished children of Eve in our world? Who might be helped by coordinated action on the part of relatively privileged American feminists and the relatively privileged Catholic magisterium? Hereâ\\x80\\x99s my suggestion: the women ravaged by the ten year old civil war in the Congo. The week before the Popeâ\\x80\\x99s visit, Lisa F. Jacksonâ\\x80\\x99s documentary, The Greatest Silence: Rape in the Congo, premiered on HBO. The story is horrifying. Gang rape is ruthlessly employed as a tool of political violence. Over thirty percent of those raped contract HIV/AIDS. Unimaginably violated, sometimes with sticks and guns, these women are no longer virgins; their wounds are so grave they may never be mothers. But they, like Mary, are also made in the image and likeness of God.\\n\\nThis year marks the 20th anniversary of Mulieris Dignitatem, Pope John Paul IIâ\\x80\\x99s Apostolic Letter on the Dignity and Vocation of Women. Catholic relief workers and women religious already have a presence in the Congo. A concerted effort to stop the rape, and to bind up the wounds of the victims, would be a fitting commemoration of the document. It would also be a project on which everyone concerned about the well being of women could work together.\\n\\nM. Cathleen Kaveny is the John P.

       "  'text': 'Feminism has never exactly been thought of as a laugh riot, but somehow Wendy Wasserstein managed to locate its funny bone. Not by mocking it -- she was an ardent believer -- but by making the intoxicating, bewildering choices it presented to women a natural ingredient of the human comedy.\\n\\nFrom her earliest efforts, such as \"Uncommon Women and Others,\" to the mid-career triumph of the Pulitzer Prize-winning \"Heidi Chronicles\" to such later, sardonic plays as \"An American Daughter\" and \"Third,\" Wasserstein made her central subjects the question of what women of her generation wanted and the less facile realities of what they got.\\n\\n\"Having it all.\" Ha! In Wasserstein\\'s work, the phrase engendered as much in the way of confusion as freedom.\\n\\nShe charted an up-and-down theatrical career through the changing longitudes and latitudes of her life. It\\'s not surprising that many who admired her writing for the stage felt as if they were forging a personal relationship with her, as her tastefully sunny plays seemed to grow up with them, recounting episodes at college and work and family gatherings and bouts in later middle age with wearying illnesses.\\n\\nAnd now she has died at age 55, five years younger than the great August Wilson, whose passing occurred a scant four months ago. Her death by lymphoma came yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The theater world, knowing for several weeks that she was gravely sick, had been keeping a word-of-mouth vigil for her, and still the news of the demise of such an ebullient chronicler of New York womanhood was a shock. And even sadder because of Lucy, the 6-year-old daughter she leaves behind. Wasserstein had Lucy at age 48 by artificial insemination, and the biological father was a friend whom the unmarried Wasserstein never identified publicly.\\n\\nThe American theater these days is like an appliance in a model line that\\'s no longer being dependably stocked. When a part goes, where do you turn to order the replacement? Wasserstein\\'s plays were not uniformly satisfying. After the Broadway acclaim for \"The Heidi Chronicles\" (1989) and the warmly observed \"Sisters Rosensweig,\" (1993), she was unable to sing as acutely in any other key. But make no mistake: She had established herself as a commercially successful Broadway dramatist in an era when virtually no other woman -- heck, virtually no one at all -- was doing so. Her comedies will justly be remembered as vibrant documents of an urbane baby-boom generation and the more progressive view of women it embraced.\\n\\nShe was sort of the Neil Simon of the ERA. (If you don\\'t know that ERA stands for \"Equal Rights Amendment,\" you are probably too young to have appreciated Wasserstein in her prime.) In fairness, her plays were more topical than Simon\\'s, and although she often could not resist the ba-dum-bum temptations of the slick one-liner, her comedy was both more humane and more calculated to get a rise out of members of her own choir. The comedies are filled with knowing references to highbrow culture and pop, from Wittgenstein to Judy Collins. \"Do you know,\" one of the students observes in \"Uncommon Women and Others\" -- the 1977 play set at her alma mater, Mount Holyoke College -- \"the first time I ever really understood about diaphragms or sex was from reading \\'The Group.\\' \"\\n\\n\"Wendy couldn\\'t help but write a happy ending in everything she wrote because her business was comedy,\" says Ari Roth, artistic director of Theater J. In 2004, his company, ensconced at the D.C. Jewish Community Center, premiered a double bill of Wasserstein playlets, one of which, \"Third,\" later was expanded and then presented last autumn by Lincoln Center Theater. \"She knew how she wanted to end her plays, and so they ended with satisfaction and redemption, even though they could also be bittersweet.\"\\n\\nIn person she could be bubbly, ingratiating, resolutely unglamorous. She had a pudding face, she was rumpled, her hair was often a twisting thicket of unruly curls, and there was a magnetism in her wit and lack of vanity. City-born and -bred, she seemed a quintessential product of New York, always running with the \"in\" theater crowd: Her wide range of pals included such writers as New York Times columnist Frank Rich and such elite drama people as Andre Bishop, artistic director at Lincoln Center Theater, who in stints there and earlier at Playwrights Horizons first presented the bulk of her work.\\n\\nShe wasn\\'t wildly prolific, but \"Heidi\" -- which records the life and times of an art history professor passing through the turbulent, evolutionary late 1960s, \\'70s and \\'80s -- cemented her position as an \"event\" playwright.\\n\\nShe was also a cultural humorist, an observer of the Manhattan folkways of Saks and Zabar\\'s, the Met and the Plaza. Her articles regularly appeared in newspapers and magazines. She wrote about her love of the theater, most memorably in a children\\'s book, \"Pamela\\'s First Musical,\" that\\'s been adapted as, yes, a musical. One of the theater projects she championed was the \"Open Doors\" program administered by the Theater Development Fund, which sent public high school students to a season\\'s worth of plays and musicals, accompanied by professionals in the theater.\\n\\n\"New York playwright liberal\" was the title she conferred on herself, with a degree of wryness, during an interview I conducted with her in March 1997 in Cafe Un Deux Trois, a theater district bistro. At the time, she was preparing for the debut of her most overtly political play, \"An American Daughter,\" inspired by the Zoe Baird incident. Baird was President Bill Clinton\\'s nominee for attorney general who withdrew after it was revealed that she had employed illegal immigrants in her home. Like many of Wasserstein\\'s plays, this one eventually made its way to Washington: \"An American Daughter\" was produced in 2003 at Arena Stage.\\n\\nWasserstein viewed Baird\\'s turmoil as emblematic of the progress women had made and the bias that persisted against those who tried to rise too high in a man\\'s world. Still, the piece lacked the brand of native wisdom, that heightened knowledge of a subject from the inside out, that characterized \"Uncommon Women\" and \"The Heidi Chronicles.\" The play got tepid receptions here and in New York.\\n\\nAlthough her health seemed to decline shortly after the difficult birth of her daughter, Wasserstein returned in her last plays to topics of more intimate concern. \"Welcome to My Rash,\" the playlet paired at Theater J with \"Third,\" took up the question of a woman with facial paralysis and a mysterious rash between her legs. It was a rather sober work, looking at the issue of a middle-aged writer and a brush with mortality.\\n\\nTrue to her nature, Wasserstein wrote an upbeat conclusion. The character undergoes an experimental transfusion and, as Roth put it, \"regains her equilibrium.\"\\n\\n\"That was Wendy,\" he adds. \"Ever the optimist.\"',\n",

To see a slideshow of images from the exhibition, click\\n\\nIf you have an image of the 1930s, the odds are it will be in black-and-white. This was the decade of the Great Depression and in both Britain and the United States, photographers worked almost exclusively in monochrome. Many books, songs and documentaries of the era - from The Grapes of Wrath and The Road to Wigan Pier to Woody Guthrie and John Grierson - are suffused with the same austere spirit, exacting a full look at the worst (hunger, poverty and oppression) with the aim of changing conditions for the better. The work isn\\'t uniformly grim, but even the more hopeful images seem to be filtered through a lens of dusty grey - like the cold, post-apocalyptic ash that overlays the landscape in Cormac McCarthy\\'s gruelling new novel, The Road.\\n\\n\"Is there even one photograph of the depression in colour?\" the critic Max Kozloff asked in 1975. The answer seemed to be no, despite the fact that colour photographs had been produced (with variable results) since 1861. But the Eastman Kodak company began marketing their revolutionary new colour film, Kodachrome, in 1936, and it was known that several professional photographers in the US - including Jack Delano, Russell Lee and Marion Post Wolcott - made use of it. So where did their transparencies go?\\n\\nIn 1978 a historian called Sally Stein solved the mystery - a classic case of bureaucratic misfiling - when she turned up 700 colour pictures taken for the Farm Security Administration (and its successor, the Office of War Information) in the archives of the Library of Congress. Even then, people were slow to respond to the significance of her discovery, doubtless from a prejudice that colour photography lacks the purity of monochrome.\\n\\nDo the FSA\\'s colour images change the way we see the 1930s? A little, yes. The received image of the US rural south, for instance, comes from the photos Walker Evans took of three sharecropper families in Alabama in 1936, which formed part of James Agee\\'s classic book Let Us Now Praise Famous Men. By contrast, the new exhibition offers a homesteader family from Pie Town, New Mexico, shot in colour by Russell Lee in 1940. They are no more smiling than their Alabama counterparts, and, to judge by their dugout log cabin home, can lay claim to even less affluence. But the bright hues of the clothes the children wear, reflected in their blue eyes and pink cheeks, convey a message of wholesome perseverance, not dirt and despair.\\n\\nBoys fishing in a blue bayou in Louisiana, a Mississippi storefront with a red Coca-Cola advertising sign, a Texas schoolgirl with auburn hair being given a typhoid injection, a whitewashed church stranded in green fields in Kansas, the fun of a state fair under blue skies in Vermont - the colours are subdued rather than garish, but there\\'s a warmth to them and a patchwork comprehensiveness (the united colours of America) that monochrome can\\'t match. Most haunting of all is an image of five black workers chopping cotton on rented land in Georgia, each differently dressed but with their hoes leaning at the same angle. The work is hard, all the more so since their feet are bare, but the stony earth exudes a rich orange glow. In the background you can just make out a small child who carries the hope that for the next generation, life will be more rewarding.\\n\\nIf monochrome can make things look bleaker than they are, colour can make them look too cheery; that\\'s the risk, so these photos would seem to suggest. But the mood of optimism may be just an accident of chronology: no colour photos taken for the FSA before 1939 have survived, so those we have all date from a period when - following the dictates of its leader in Washington, Roy Stryker - the project changed direction, away from highlighting social hardship on the land, towards celebrating patriotic unity. \"Emphasise the ideas of abundance,\" Stryker wrote in a letter to one of his photographers, Jack Delano, in September 1940. \"Pour maple syrup over it - you know - mix well with white clouds and put on a sky-blue platter. I know your damned photographer\\'s soul writhes, but to hell with it. Do you think I give a damn about a photographer\\'s soul with Hitler at our doorstep? You are nothing but camera fodder to me.\"\\n\\nLuckily, the men and women shooting for Stryker were more than supine propagandists. They knew a good image when they saw one, regardless of whether or not it helped the New Deal or built national pride. By the end of 1941, though, with the US belatedly at war, patriotism was unavoidable. Most of the photos from the next two years show people in cities working with machines, rather than rustics struggling on the land. Many are women, soldering wire, turning lathes and tightening bolts on bombers.\\n\\nAccording to Gary Ross\\'s film Pleasantville, America was repressed and monochrome until the late 1950s, and would have remained so for much longer but for two American teenagers whisked back in time from the 1990s. It\\'s a nice jokey premise. But now we know that Ross was out by two decades. America got colour - in all its sumptuous splendour - in 1939.\\n\\n· Bound for Glory: America in Colour 1939-1943 opens at the Photographers\\' Gallery, Great Newport St, London WC2, on December 8. The complete collection of 170,000 FSA photographs is available at lcweb.loc.gov/rr/print',\n",

They’ll be signing “How to Win At Feminism” Friday at Skylight Books in Los Angeles at 7:30 p.m. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\\n\\nSome of the funniest passages in the book come in the form of “Advertorials.” “Lumps Gym” sends up the rhetoric around women’s fitness: at Lumps Gym, “it’s not about changing your body, it’s about changing your whole self.” What was the inspiration?\\n\\nSarah Pappalardo: The inspiration for the advertorials came in part from the ads you find in women’s magazines, especially the kind where the “storytelling” aims to absolve women of their guilt for living in a developed world and with the degree of wealth and privilege. It’s everything from these kind of well-meaning companies that don’t always do very much to actually to change the world, all the way down to the “empowerment marketing” that we see used to sell lotion or tea or chocolate, these “gendered” products. The “Lumps Gym” advertorial is a good example of where we used as much doublespeak as possible. There’s this trend of, “You need to love your body no matter what, but you also need to be healthy, but you also need to love your body,” ad nauseam.\\n\\nBeth Newell: No matter how empowering certain media is it’s still telling us that we need to change something or buy something. It’s always preying on our insecurity, even when it’s in the guise of female empowerment.\\n\\nPieces often begin on the edge of plausibility then escalate to full-blown absurdity. You both come from comedy backgrounds. Can you talk about that sense of escalation in regard to structure?\\n\\nPappalardo: I don’t want to mansplain here, but there’s a term for that and it’s called heightening. Whoops! I just mansplained.\\n\\nLike Reductress, “How to Win at Feminism” feels of-the-moment not just in content, but also in tone, toggling between references to Instagram, Ruth Bader Ginsberg, selfies and bell hooks. Did you have a millennial audience in mind?\\n\\nPappalardo: I think it’s a very millennial book. We do have a few Easter eggs in there for people who may be of the, uh, older persuasion. (They’ve made a lifestyle choice to grow old, but I don’t know why.) We reference a lot of second-wave feminism, things that our mothers dealt with and that we now take for granted. That was a big inspiration for us as well.\\n\\nNewell: One of things that’s exciting for us to cover is the ways that women interact with feminist issues in their daily lives, today, in 2016. A lot of people have a tendency to think that feminist issues have been resolved, and we’re shining a light on what’s still going on out there. What the book and the site are doing is allowing us to laugh at ourselves.\\n\\nDo you consider writing satire a political act?\\n\\nNewell: Satire is a more cathartic, palatable way of getting the news you already get — it doesn’t necessarily change any minds. The only place where I could see satire really affecting change is when it comes to young people who are just entering the political conversation and trying to educate themselves about the forces at play. Otherwise I think it reinforces our perceptions of the world.\\n\\nPappalardo: We’re not necessarily going to change minds, but we do hope to highlight the things that people take for granted in terms of subtle messaging and micro-aggressions aimed towards women. Satire allows us to make a statement through both form and content, as opposed to just saying ‘Hey, this is a problem.’ But if you don’t agree with the same premises that we do when we’re constructing satire, you can read a satirical piece entirely differently than intended.\\n\\nDo you have any concerns that the title, or even the book itself, might be read that way – “differently than intended?”\\n\\nNewell: A man at a book fair told us that we were the reason that Trump was getting elected. We don’t really know what his thought process was.\\n\\nPappalardo: I know! I mean, it was a comedy book fair! Regarding the title, we wanted it clear that the title undermines the genuine goals and tenets and feminism, which is that feminism is for everyone. We wanted to go in direct contrast to that, so that you see the title and think, “Hey, wait a minute, that’s not right.”\\n\\nFrench is a writer in Los Angeles.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Since the financial turmoil began, many analysts, investors and pundits have fretted about a repeat of the Great Depression. They worry that the pain is not over yet and fear that other shoes--like foreclosures or commercial real estate--will drop, causing another economic slide. They worry that when government stimulus winds down, the economy will fall again.\\n\\nThe opposite view is also in play. Many fear excess government activity. They worry that government has become too big and too much of a burden. Even if health care reform or a cap-and-trade carbon emissions scheme are no longer a threat, it\\'s the \"uncertainty\" of all this government activity that is holding back business decisions, undermining job growth and threatening to cause further declines in economic activity. This is the key fear of many conservative pundits.\\n\\nHowever, it\\'s important to put things in perspective. Real GDP fell for four consecutive years (and by a total of more than 25%) between 1929 and 1933. Unemployment reached 25%. Nothing today even comes close. GDP is now rising and we expect unemployment has peaked.\\n\\nThe reason the Great Depression became so great was because government policies were outrageously bad. The Federal Reserve, which was less than two decades old at the time, made huge mistakes and allowed the money supply to decline by a third between 1929 and 1933. At the same time, President Herbert Hoover increased the top marginal income tax rate from 25% to 63% in 1932--a more than 50% reduction in the incentive to work and invest.\\n\\nThen President Franklin Delano Roosevelt raised the top rate again, to 79%, cutting the incentive to produce even more. Add the Smoot-Hawley increase in tariffs on international trade in 1930, and it is easy to understand that the Great Depression was a made-in-Washington crisis. Moreover, while it is true that uncertainty played a big role in holding back economic activity, especially later in the 1930s, it is clear that there were actual policies (not just threats of policies) that had an impact.\\n\\nThis puts today in a different light. While tax rates are scheduled to rise in 2011, this is still not a certainty and the tax-rate hikes themselves are nothing on the order of those imposed under Hoover and Roosevelt. Moreover, national health care and cap-and-trade legislation are clearly in critical condition.\\n\\nNo matter how big of a drift toward populism it appears the country has taken, it is also clear that President Obama is losing ground with his agenda. The Democratic majority is shrinking and will likely shrink more in the months to come. As a result, the odds of repeating anything like the Great Depression are low and falling by the day. It\\'s not the 1930s--it\\'s not even close.\\n\\nBrian S. Wesbury is chief economist and Robert Stein senior economist at First Trust Advisors in Wheaton, Ill.They write a weekly column for Forbes.

       "  'text': 'SHERYL SANDBERG is not one to settle for being the It Girl of Silicon Valley.\\n\\nNor is the chief operating officer of Facebook willing to write a book that people might merely read.\\n\\nOne of her friends from her Harvard days told Vogue that the brainy, beautiful, charming, stylish, happily married 43-year-old mother of two, one of the world’s richest self-made women, has an “infectious insistence.” (She would have to, having founded Harvard’s aerobics program in the ’80s, wearing blue eye shadow and leg warmers.)\\n\\nNow that she has domesticated the Facebook frat house, Sandberg wants to be “the pompom girl for feminism,” as she calls it. She has a grandiose plan to become the PowerPoint Pied Piper in Prada ankle boots reigniting the women’s revolution — Betty Friedan for the digital age. She wants women to stop limiting and sabotaging themselves.\\n\\nThe petite corporate star is larger than life, and a normal book tour for “Lean In,” which she describes as “sort of a feminist manifesto” mixed with career advice, just won’t do.\\n\\n“I always thought I would run a social movement,” she said in “Makers,” an AOL/PBS documentary on feminist history.\\n\\nSandberg may have caught the fever to change the world from Mark Zuckerberg, or come by it genetically. She writes that her mother, at age 11, responded to a rabbi’s sermon on tikkun olam, the Jewish concept of repairing the world, by “grabbing a tin can and knocking on doors to support civil rights workers in the South.”\\n\\nThe charmed Sandberg is no Queen Bee. Unlike some other women who reach the top, she does not pull up the ladder, or jungle gym, as she prefers to think of it, behind her. Many women found it inspiring when she said in “Makers” that she left work at 5:30 to go home to her kids, even while they acknowledged that you might have to be Sheryl Sandberg to get away with that.\\n\\nSandberg, who worked at the Treasury Department for her mentor, Larry Summers, and at Google before going to Facebook, started a group called the Women of Silicon Valley to listen to celebrity speakers and swap stories.\\n\\nShe knows there is slow evolution or even erosion in women’s progress in some areas, and that many younger women don’t want to be called feminists. Professional women often take their husbands’ last names these days without a thought.\\n\\nHer book is chockablock with good tips and insights, if a bit discouraging at times. She urges women in salary negotiations to smile frequently and use the word “we” instead of “I.” And she encourages employers and women to talk upfront about plans for children, which employers may fear is lawsuit fodder.\\n\\nShe seems to think she can remedy social paradigms with a new kind of club — a combo gabfest, Oprah session and corporate pep talk. (Where’s the yoga?)\\n\\nSandberg has been recruiting corporations to join her Lean In Foundation, which will create the Lean In Community and Lean In Circles, which are, as The Times’s Jodi Kantor wrote, like “consciousness-raising groups of yore.” The circles will entail 8 to 12 peers who will meet monthly and use “education modules” to learn the skills to pursue equality. (Like how Rosa Parks used bus modules.) The debut assignment is a video on how to command more authority by altering how you speak and sit.\\n\\nWomen are encouraged to send in stories about leaning in, but no sad sacks allowed: “Share a positive ending about what you learned from the experience,” says the instructional material for Lean In Circles. And no truants: “Don’t invite flakes.”\\n\\nThat leaves me leaning out.\\n\\nSandberg has already gotten some flak from women who think that her attitude is too elitist and that she is too prone to blame women for failing to get ahead. (Not everyone has Larry Page and Sergey Brin volunteering to baby-sit, and Zuckerberg offering a shoulder to cry on.) Noting that her Facebook page for “Lean In” looks more like an ego wall with “deep thoughts,” critics argue that her unique perch as a mogul with the world’s best husband to boot makes her tone-deaf to the problems average women face as they struggle to make ends meet in a rough economy, while taking care of kids, aging parents and housework.\\n\\nSandberg describes taking her kids to a business conference last year and realizing en route that her daughter had head lice. But the good news was that she was on the private eBay jet.\\n\\nSandberg may mean well, and she may be setting up a run for national office. But she doesn’t understand the difference between a social movement and a social network marketing campaign. Just because digital technology makes connecting possible doesn’t mean you’re actually reaching people.\\n\\nPeople come to a social movement from the bottom up, not the top down. Sandberg has co-opted the vocabulary and romance of a social movement not to sell a cause, but herself.\\n\\nShe says she’s using marketing for the purpose of social idealism. But she’s actually using social idealism for the purpose of marketing.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Reading the variety of reasons that women gave for being opposed to feminism in the much-debated #WomenAgainstFeminism social media campaign is one of the most profoundly depressing experiences I’ve had for a while.\\n\\nThe reason is a fairly basic one. In some ways, it doesn’t much matter whether or not those women choose to define themselves as feminists, or anything else for that matter.\\n\\nThe reality is that at some point in their lives these women – most of them still quite young, to judge by the photos of themselves they post alongside their reasons for rejecting the feminist label – are going to realize that “feminist” issues are not other people’s problems. From birth control to the wage gap to financial savvy, the “feminist” issues are the everyday obstacles that will shape the lives of young women too.\\n\\nThe Women against Feminism campaign is particularly unsettling because it suggests that lessons have been lost. Jane O’Reilly wrote about some of them in her iconic 1971 essay about the radicalization of the American housewife.\\n\\nIt’s a matter of time. Nearly every women is likely to encounter the same kind of “click” moment that Jane O’Reilly so evocatively describes. Perhaps it won’t involve housework.\\n\\nOpen contributions: What do you think?\\n\\nDon’t laugh: stereotypes like these, and not just a lack of women studying math and sciences, mean math, engineering and science programs struggle to recruit women to study fields that will put them on the path to earning higher incomes.\\n\\nA key thing to understand is that feminism is not necessarily about demonizing men as oppressive beings. Men can be feminists too, if they support equality.\\n\\nSince this is the Money page, let’s put the sexual politics – reproductive health, sexual violence and related issues – to one side.\\n\\nLet’s focus squarely on the economic issues, because feminism is an economic issue. Feminism is about recognizing the facts that govern the economic existence of women: we earn less, we save less, we live longer.\\n\\nIt may be nice to wear interesting eyeliner and have nice clothes, but it’s less fun if you have to ask a man or your parents for the money, thus giving them financial power over your look, your life and your decisions.\\n\\nSome things to consider before dismissing feminism: its whole point is to empower you to stand on your own two feet financially. You will need that – even if you don’t think so now.\\n\\nIf you’re a woman, you’re going to make less than you would if you were a man. This is not necessarily because women prefer lower-paying jobs as teachers or nurses to have flexibility. Even if you’re a doctor, it’s likely you’ll earn 71 cents on the dollar compared to your male peers, well below the average of 77 cents. There is even some research suggesting that the gender pay gap for younger women may be widening, in spite of the fact that on average, they are emerging from college better prepared to compete equally with their male counterparts.\\n\\nMaybe it’s semantics. Don’t call yourself a feminist, if the label seems offensive in some way. But you should think like a feminist – which to me means believing that you’re entitled to equal pay for work of equal value, to equal opportunities for employment and advancement, to being viewed as a first-class citizen by both employers and employees.\\n\\nTo the extent that feminists has earned a reputation for not being nice – and heavens, even a bit abrasive – it’s precisely because any time you’re part of a group that is operating at an economic disadvantage, and you start speaking up about it and trying to change things, playing nice simply doesn’t work.\\n\\nWhen Emily Davison threw herself under the hooves of George V’s horse at Epsom Derby in 1913, it wasn’t because dying for the cause of a women’s right to vote her first strategic choice. It was the outcome of years of increasingly active attempts to change an inequitable power structure. Revolutions don’t start quietly, and change is usually hard-won through relentless effort.\\n\\nIn North America and Europe today, we’re in a position of tremendous luxury. Many of us will never be told, outright, that we can’t or shouldn’t do something simply because we’re women. That’s common in other cultures, so we feel protected in the west. I trace my own willingness to call myself a feminist to the moment at my Japanese graduate school where a professor told me that I was not allowed to speak in the seminar class he taught, because I was a woman; the university’s authorities had no problem with this stance. Click.\\n\\nOur relative privilege doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t be aware of the ways in which our gender affects our economic wellbeing. In my next column, I’ll discuss some practical ways to avoid having that happen – whatever label you choose to wear.',\n",

       "  'text': 'NEW YORK (AP) \\x97 Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin said Wednesday that the United States could be headed for another Great Depression if Congress doesn\\'t act on the financial crisis.\\n\\nPalin made the comment in an interview with \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Katie Couric while visiting New York to meet foreign leaders for the first time in her political career. As Palin sought to establish her credentials in world affairs, first lady Laura Bush said Palin lacked sufficient foreign policy experience but was \"a quick study.\"\\n\\nRecent surveys have shown that Palin\\'s popularity, while still strong, has begun to fade.\\n\\nEarlier this month, an Associated Press-Yahoo News poll showed more people viewing Palin favorably than unfavorably, 47% to 28%. But an ABC News-Washington Post poll released Wednesday showed that in a two-week period, the number seeing Palin positively dropped 6 percentage points while 10 points more see her unfavorably. On Monday, a CNN-Opinion Research Corp. poll said her favorable rating dropped 4 points and her unfavorable rating rose 8 points over two weeks.\\n\\nPalin has been in New York this week for a series of meetings with foreign leaders, part of an effort by Republican John McCain\\'s presidential campaign to counter criticism that the former small-town mayor lacks the experience to be vice president, let alone president in an emergency.\\n\\nThe CBS interview was just her third major interview in nearly four weeks on the GOP presidential ticket. Asked whether there\\'s a risk of another Great Depression if Congress doesn\\'t approve a $700 billion bailout package, Palin said, \"Unfortunately, that is the road that America may find itself on.\"\\n\\nPalin said the answer to the financial crisis doesn\\'t necessarily have to be the bailout plan the Bush administration has proposed, but that it should be some form of bipartisan action to reform Wall Street.\\n\\n\"I\\'m ill about the position that America is in and that we have to look at a $700 billion bailout. At the same time we know that inaction is not an option and as Sen. McCain has said unless this nearly trillion-dollar bailout is what it may end up to be, unless there are amendments in Paulson\\'s proposal, really I don\\'t believe that Americans are going to support this and we will not support this,\" Palin said in the interview.\\n\\nCouric pressed Palin on examples of how McCain, a 26-year congressional veteran, had led the charge for more oversight.\\n\\nThe Alaska governor cited McCain\\'s warnings about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac two years ago as well as his image as a maverick. Questioned again for examples, and reminded that McCain had been chairman of the Commerce Committee, Palin said, \"I\\'ll try to find you some and I\\'ll bring them to you.\"\\n\\nMcCain has insisted Palin is ready to take over as president, but he made no mention of including her in the meetings he wants in Washington to deal with the financial crisis.\\n\\nLaura Bush told CNN that she thought Palin had \"a lot of really good common sense\" and commended her executive experience. Asked if she thought Palin had sufficient foreign policy experience, the first lady said: \"Of course she doesn\\'t have that. You know, that\\'s not been her role, but I think she is a very quick study, and fortunately John McCain does have that sort of experience.\"\\n\\nPalin covered a range of issues Wednesday in her conversations with foreign leaders, according to her foreign policy adviser, Stephen Biegun.\\n\\nShe and Iraqi President Jalal Talabani discussed a new election law approved by parliament this week that paves the way for the first provincial elections in four years. Biegun also said Talabani was greatly interested in the Alaska Permanent Fund, which gives residents a share of the state\\'s oil wealth.\\n\\n\"It\\'s something the Iraqis were well-familiar with, and it\\'s apparently something that they\\'re looking at as a model to pursue the development of their oil fields,\" Biegun said.\\n\\nOn her way to that meeting, Palin got a glimpse of ground zero for the Sept. 11 terror attacks in New York as her motorcade made its way downtown. She did not respond to a reporter\\'s question about what she thought when she passed by the 16-acre site.\\n\\nHer motorcade was stuck in traffic for a few minutes along its western border, where passersby can see cranes jutting into the sky from the base of the deep pit that once was the World Trade Center basement. Crews are building a memorial to the attacks and a 1,776-foot-tall building to replace the destroyed twin towers.\\n\\nPalin met with Talabani and then with Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari before an evening session with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Earlier Wednesday, Palin and McCain met jointly with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili and Ukrainian President Viktor Yuschenko.\\n\\nThe McCain campaign set up the sessions with the leaders, who were among those in town for the U.N. General Assembly.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Palin\\'s infant son and two youngest daughters headed home to Alaska after a day of quintessential New York sightseeing with their father, Todd Palin. He took them to the tip of Manhattan to see the Statue of Liberty. The family also visited ground zero, and ate hot dogs and soft pretzels in Central Park.\\n\\nThey stopped at the FAO Schwarz toy store, where daughter Piper tried on princess dresses, the campaign said.\\n\\nAt the start of her meeting with Talabani, the governor was overheard saying: \"There\\'s plenty to do here, isn\\'t there?

       "  'text': 'Elaine Showalter is professor emerita of English and humanities at Princeton University. She is writing a biography of Julia Ward Howe.\\n\\n‘I am not a postfeminism feminist. I am the Third Wave,” Yale senior Rebecca Walker proclaimed in January 1992, calling on her generation via Ms. magazine to claim its place in feminist history and to reanimate a women’s movement that seemed dated, if not defunct.\\n\\nThe daughter of novelist Alice Walker and the goddaughter of Gloria Steinem, Rebecca Walker had grown up with a feminism as normal and invisible as fluoride in the water; but even those contemporaries who lacked her exceptional opportunities had lived their entire lives in a culture shaped by the women’s movement, and had come of age with contraception and legal abortion. They took feminism for granted or dismissed it as irrelevant.\\n\\nBut that attitude changed, Walker wrote, when young women became outraged by the spectacle of Anita Hill testifying on sexual harassment before 14 skeptical white male members of the Senate Judiciary Committee during the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings. Now, she declared, they needed to wake up, “turn that outrage into political power” and continue the fight.\\n\\nBy naming her feminist generation the Third Wave, Walker followed the standard historical description of periods of American feminism as “waves,” intense surges of political activism followed by tranquil decades of consolidation, backlash or retreat. The first wave was the suffrage movement, culminating in the ratification of the 19th Amendment on Aug. 18, 1920. Fifty years later, in the second wave, American women came together to fight for equal rights to education, employment, housing and protection under the law.\\n\\n“Feminism Unfinished,” however, argues that the “wave” metaphor obscures the history of a continuous American women’s movement sustained by labor activists, civil rights advocates and \\xadsocial-reform campaigners, who may have looked placid on the surface but were paddling like hell underneath. Each of the three authors contributes a chapter to their history of American feminism, and they declare together in their prologue that “there was no period in the last century in which women were not campaigning for greater equality and freedom.” They hope that uncovering the “multiple and unfinished feminisms of the twentieth century can inspire” the women’s movements of the 21st. That’s the surprise signaled in the teasing subtitle.\\n\\nYet the book’s position on the potential for another American women’s movement is more cautious and qualified than the title suggests. The real surprise is that the authors believe that the United States “no longer serves as a world leader when it comes to gender equality” and that the future of feminism may be global rather than American.\\n\\nIn her chapter on “Feminism After Suffrage,” Dorothy Sue Cobble, a professor of history and labor studies at Rutgers, explores the history of American women in the labor movement and civil rights organizations in the decades after the 19th Amendment. She calls the working-class, minority and leftist women in these campaigns “social justice feminists,” who saw economic fairness as the most important key to an egalitarian society. Ironically, the greatest achievement for women during this period was the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, after Rep. Howard Smith, a Virginia conservative, laughingly proposed adding “sex” to the regulations forbidding discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion or national origin. Social-justice feminists opposed Smith’s “Sex Amendment,” which they saw as a strategy to delay, dilute or destroy the bill. And in 1966, when NOW (the National Organization for Women) was founded by Pauli Murray and Betty Friedan as an “NAACP for women,” many social-justice feminists resisted an alliance overtly based on women’s rights. A “feminism” that dared not speak its name was hardly a women’s movement.\\n\\nIn her chapter on “The Women’s Liberation Moment,” Linda Gordon, a professor of history and humanities at New York University, gives long-overdue credit to NOW for its stability, discipline and longevity. She also explains the importance of consciousness-raising in the 1970s. Many women were unaware of their limited opportunities or secondary roles as political problems. Small, leaderless groups, in which women came together to talk about their lives, led them to realize that “the personal was political,” that their intimate and private experiences in the family, school, workplace, sexuality, marriage and divorce were shared by millions of other women. These epiphanies were then channeled into political organization, coalitions and effective action. The women’s liberation movement also educated further generations through women’s studies programs, books, manifestos and magazines.\\n\\nIn 1973, two major Supreme Court decisions — one that banned sex-segregated employment ads, and the famous Roe v. Wade, making abortion legal — had an immediate and lasting impact on women’s lives. Gordon is the only contributor who relates feminism to her own career: “All three of us college professors writing this book, like all professional women and college students, benefited directly from feminism and the affirmative action programs pushed by the movement.”\\n\\nIn the most instructive and challenging chapter, “From a Mindset to a Movement,” Astrid Henry, a professor of women’s studies at Grinnell, traces the development of American feminism since the 1990s. Twenty-first-century feminism is multiracial and multicultural; it links to LGBT groups and protests the global issues of sexual oppression and violence against women. At the same time, it enjoys and endorses new images of women in pop culture, and plays with fashion, make-up and personal style as self-expression. “Unlike my first- and second-wave predecessors,” one fashionista explains, “no one force-fed me femininity. . . . I had to fight for it tooth and nail.” These women rely on e-mail, blogs and Twitter to attract followers and build community awareness. “We began our activism online,” another notes. “Blogs are our consciousness-raising groups.” Some contemporary feminists are concerned with the major American failure to implement family-friendly policies such as state-subsidized child care and paid parental leaves. As the Washington writer Ann Crittenden has pointed out, “This is the big unfinished business of the women’s movement.”\\n\\nBut Henry also admits that “the most defining feature of this generation of feminists is its inability to be defined by any single political goal, ideological perspective, or way of being feminist.” Hashtag feminism “runs the risk of being merely an identity to claim without any political content.” Perhaps, Henry suggests, the diversity and flexibility of “a million little grass-roots movements” are stronger than “one singular vision for social change.” She points to demonstrations, foundations and fundraising as examples of 21st-century feminist activism. Still, she acknowledges concerns that “feminism as a concept is now so watered-down as to be meaningless.”\\n\\nI share that concern. In my view, a mass movement requires a clear goal, compelling enough to unite people across the dividing lines of race, class, age, religion, sexual orientation and ethnicity, and to persuade them to work collectively to achieve it. The goal must be concrete and attainable, even if its ideological underpinnings are complex or contradictory. A movement also requires charismatic leaders to galvanize its adherents into effective action.\\n\\nBut what goal unites American women now? Which leaders inspire us? As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg recently said, women’s autonomy and dignity in the United States are being undermined and eroded just when gay rights are getting overdue attention and respect. Feminism unfinished, American women’s movement finished, would be a sad epitaph to a glorious history.\\n\\nElaine Showalter is professor emerita of English and humanities at Princeton University.

       "  'text': 'All around the country, crowds of people have been lying on the ground in silence—sometimes with tape over their mouths, sometimes surrounded by chalk outlines as if at a crime scene. They are staging “die-ins,” quietly forbidding gestures of protest in the wake of the recent grand jury decisions not to indict police officers in the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown.\\n\\nThe “die-in,” powerful in its tranquility, carries on a tradition of nonviolent demonstrations labeled with the “-in” suffix. They are all modeled on the “sit-in,” originally the name for a strike in which workers would protest by “sitting in” or occupying a building.\\n\\nOne early “sit-in strike” (also called a “sit-down strike”) took place in December 1936, when thousands of employees of the Emergency Relief Bureau staged all-night demonstrations at bureau offices in New York City, protesting strict new civil-service requirements. The workers’ union even bought radio time during the strike, with an announcer broadcasting a play-by-play of the goings-on at bureau headquarters.\\n\\nAs the night wore on, the announcer relayed to the radio audience that “the sit-inners have now taken to lying down, and chamber music is now in order,” according to an article in the New York Herald Tribune.\\n\\nIn 1960, the peaceful “sit-in” became a favored tactic among civil-rights activists protesting segregation. In Greensboro, N.C., that year, four black college students famously asked to be seated at a whites-only lunch counter at the local Woolworth’s and then continued to sit quietly when they were refused service.\\n\\nThe civil-rights sit-in spawned many variations on the “-in” theme, including “kneel-ins” at segregated churches and “study-ins” at segregated schools. Student antiwar protesters then took up the mantle, beginning with the first “teach-in” at the University of Michigan in 1965.\\n\\nThe burgeoning counterculture got on the “-in” train, though the hippie “be-ins” and “love-ins” of the late ’60s were often simply good-vibe gatherings without any overt protest.\\n\\nPerhaps the first “die-in” was organized in Boston for Earth Day in April 1970. As the Boston Globe reported, protesters held a mock funeral “for victims of genocide in Southeast Asia, racism in America and biocide from pollution,” followed by a “die-in” with demonstrators occupying coffins. The die-in soon became a common form of protest theater, highlighting the human toll of U.S. involvement in Vietnam.\\n\\nThe gesture of antiwar dissent was revived on Sept. 15, 2007, when a march on Washington protesting the Iraq war concluded with a massive die-in in front of the Capitol building. The die-ins of 2014 apply the symbolic act to a new, heartfelt message: “Black Lives Matter.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'This may not be your grandfather\\'s Great Depression, but many aspects of today\\'s situation would remind him of the 1930s. If the recession that officially ended a year ago feels uncomfortably surreal to you yet familiar to him, it\\'s probably because the recovery went missing.\\n\\nDuring the average recovery since World War II, gross domestic product (GDP) surpassed the pre-recession high five quarters after the recession began. It has never taken longer than seven quarters. Yet today, after 11 quarters, GDP is still below what it was in the fourth quarter of 2007. The economy is growing at only about a third of the rate of previous postwar recoveries from major recessions.\\n\\nObama administration officials such as Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner have argued that without their policies the economy would be worse, and we might have fallen \"off a cliff.\" While this assertion cannot be tested, we can compare the recent experience of other countries to our own.\\n\\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt and Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr.\\n\\nThe chart nearby compares total 2007 employment levels in the United States, the United Kingdom, the 16 euro zone countries, the G-7 countries and all OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries with those of the second quarter of 2010. There are 4.6% fewer people employed in the U.S. today than at the start of the recession. Euro zone countries have lost 1.7% of their jobs. Total employment in the U.K. is down 0.6%, G-7 average employment is down 2.4%, and OECD employment has fallen 1.9%.\\n\\nThis simple comparison suggests two things. First, that American economic policy has been less effective in increasing employment than the policies of other developed nations. Second, that if there was a cliff out there, no country fell off. Those that suffered the most were the most profligate, such as Greece, and their problems can\\'t be blamed on the financial crisis. While the most recent quarterly growth figures are just a snapshot in time, it is hardly encouraging that economic growth in the U.S. (1.7%) is lower than in the euro zone (4%), U.K. (4.8%), G-7 (2.8%) and OECD (2%).\\n\\nMost striking about these comparisons is their similarity to the U.S. experience in the Great Depression. Using data from the League of Nations\\' World Economic Survey, we can look at unemployment in developed nations between 1929 and the end of 1938. Ten years after the stock market crash, total employment in the U.S. was still almost 20% below the pre-Depression level. The decline in France was similar. But in the U.K. and Italy, total employment was up 10% and 12%, respectively. Industrial production on average in the six most developed countries was almost 16% above their 1929 levels by the end of 1938, but industrial production had declined by 20% in the U.S.\\n\\nToday\\'s lagging growth and persistent high unemployment are reminiscent of the 1930s, perhaps because in no other period of American history has our government followed policies as similar to those of the Great Depression era. Federal debt by the end of 1938 was almost 150% above the 1929 level. Federal spending grew by 77% from 1932 to 1934 as the New Deal was implemented—unprecedented for peacetime.\\n\\nStill the economy did not take off. Winston Churchill gave a contemporary evaluation of the Roosevelt policy by observing, in the April 24, 1935, Daily Mail, \"Nearly two thousand millions Sterling have been poured out to prime the pump of prosperity; but prosperity has not begun to flow.\"\\n\\nThe top individual income tax rate rose from 24% to 63% to 79% during the Hoover and Roosevelt administrations. Corporate rates were increased to 15% from 11%, and when private businesses did not invest, Congress imposed a 27% undistributed profits tax.\\n\\nIn 1929, the U.S. government collected $1.1 billion in total income taxes; by 1935 collections had fallen to $527 million. In 1929, individual income taxes accounted for 38% of government revenues, corporate taxes accounted for 43%, and excise taxes for 19%. By 1939, individual income taxes made up only 26% of federal revenues, corporate income taxes made up 29%, and excise taxes made up 45%.\\n\\nWhen Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau suggested to President Roosevelt that the administration cut income tax rates in 1939, Roosevelt, apparently concerned about the possible effect of deficit-financed tax cuts on interest rates, asked, \"You are willing to pay usury in order to get recovery?\" Morgenthau said that he responded, \"Yes sir.\" The president disagreed.\\n\\nThe Roosevelt administration also conducted a seven-year populist tirade against private business, which FDR denounced as the province of \"economic royalists\" and \"malefactors of great wealth.\" The war on business and wealth was so traumatic that the League of Nations\\' 1939 World Economic Survey attributed part of the poor U.S. economic performance to it: \"The relations between the leaders of business and the Administration were uneasy, and this uneasiness accentuated the unwillingness of private enterprise to embark on further projects of capital expenditure which might have helped to sustain the economy.\"\\n\\nChurchill, who was generally guarded when criticizing New Deal policies, could not hold back. \"The disposition to hunt down rich men as if they were noxious beasts,\" he noted in \"Great Contemporaries\" (1939), is \"a very attractive sport.\" But \"confidence is shaken and enterprise chilled, and the unemployed queue up at the soup kitchens or march out to the public works with ever growing expense to the taxpayer and nothing more appetizing to take home to their families than the leg or wing of what was once a millionaire. . . It is indispensable to the wealth of nations and to the wage and life standards of labour, that capital and credit should be honoured and cherished partners in the economic system. . . .\"\\n\\nThe regulatory burden exploded during the Roosevelt administration, not just through the creation of new government agencies but through an extraordinary barrage of executive orders—more than all subsequent presidents through Bill Clinton combined. Then, as now, uncertainty reigned. As the textile innovator Lammot du Pont complained in 1937, \"Uncertainty rules the tax situation, the labor situation, the monetary situation, and practically every legal condition under which industry must operate.\"\\n\\nHenry Morgenthau summarized the policy failure to the House Ways and Means Committee in April 1939: \"Now, gentleman, we have tried spending money. We are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work . . . I say after eight years of this administration we have just as much unemployment as when we started . . . and an enormous debt, to boot.\"\\n\\nDespite the striking similarities between then and now, there is one major difference: Roosevelt\\'s policies remained popular even as the economy faltered. The magnitude of the Depression, with its lack of stabilizers and safety nets, traumatized Americans and undermined their confidence in the economic system. This induced voters, as historians would later do, to judge Roosevelt not on his results but on his intentions.\\n\\nToday, however, the Obama program appears to be failing politically as well as in the marketplace. The trauma of the financial crisis did not approach that of the Great Depression, and Americans do not appear to have lost faith in our economic system or come to see government as the savior. While progressivism gave the New Deal its intellectual foundations, history today is driven by the freedom tide that produced our economic revival in the 1980s and \\'90s and still drives economic liberalization in China and India.\\n\\nFinally, we should not underestimate that this administration faces stronger and more united congressional opposition than FDR ever faced. The House and Senate Republican leadership has far surpassed all expectations of a minority party.\\n\\nMitch McConnell of Kentucky and John Boehner of Ohio have led a loyal opposition that, through its unity, has exposed the radical underbelly of the Obama program. Young guns like Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Jeb Hensarling of Texas have provided vision and energy.\\n\\nFDR rode the tide of history while President Obama strives mightily against it. The progressive vision that resonated in the 1930s foundered on the hard experience of the 20th century, and it has no broad appeal in the 21st. The recovery from the Great Depression did not occur until World War II was underway, but it appears, as of today, that voters will bring the latest experiment in American collectivism to an end on Nov. 2. A real economic recovery won\\'t be far behind.\\n\\nMr. Gramm is a former U.S. senator from Texas and former professor of economics at Texas A&M University.',\n",

I\\'m sure none of the Republicans and (fewer) Democrats who just voted down Hank Paulson\\'s financial bail-out scheme did so believing it would consign their economy to a nasty depression. But this might just be the effect.\\n\\nShares in the US have just suffered their worst day since Black Monday in 1987. When you bear in mind that that fall (a 22.6pc plunge) came on the back of an equity bubble, whereas this circa 7pc drop in the S&P 500 comes after shares had already dropped by around 20pc in just over 12 months. America has just become significantly poorer. Many companies will now face possible closure. Unemployment - already rising rapidly - will soar to new highs. Barry Eichengreen warns that the jobless toll will exceed 10pc - and this was before the rejection of the TARP. Willem Buiter said the UK and Europe could be destined for depression unless they bail out their financials - again before this piece of news. I spoke to him shortly after the Congressional vote. He said: \"If they\\'re not bluffing, I want to move... to the moon.\"\\n\\nThey will almost certainly relent, will return to the drawing board and come up with a new plan. But that is not the point. They could easily be too late. Financial markets are not just chaotic, but are close to complete collapse. Various equity traders and money market dealers I have spoken to said that markets are so close to implosion that they suspected they would all be out of a job if the bail-out failed.\\n\\nAs the past few weeks showed us, companies can go bust very, very quickly. When they collapse they are very difficult, iif not impossible, to put back together again. The free market can be very creative but it can also be immensely destructive. This is one of those points where the scale of destruction is potentially so great that it could set the economy back years.\\n\\nWhat tomorrow brings is anyone\\'s guess, but if stocks continue to plummet there will almost certainly be more co-ordinated action from central banks. Having poured so much more liquidity into the markets on Monday, perhaps they will now go one step further and consider emergency interest rate cuts. Given the economic implcations of today\\'s vote, I think such a drastic move is now necessary.\\n\\nPS Here are two good instant takes on the vote.

For nine years, her depression was so severe that she couldnâ\\x80\\x99t hold a regular job. In 2011, she recalls staying in her pajamas for six months straight.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy husband had to put me in the shower, because I could not do it myself,â\\x80\\x9d she says. â\\x80\\x9cThe depression was just so heavy.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDepression runs in her family. When Garrett Ritchey was 10 or 11, he started struggling with the same depression that haunted his mother. The teen was bedbound and used a walker to get around the house. A year and a half ago, the depression, coupled with chronic stabbing pain in his lower back, forced him to stop working at the local movie theater, all the while telling his friends that he was doing just fine.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI literally felt like I was dead inside,â\\x80\\x9d he says. â\\x80\\x9cEvery day, Iâ\\x80\\x99d ask myself, â\\x80\\x98Is this how Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to live the rest of my life?â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRitchey, now 19, had seen what his mother went through, and he didnâ\\x80\\x99t want that. But he also noticed her improvement â\\x80\\x93 and a unique treatment she used.\\n\\nTiffaney Ritchey was on the verge of \"checking out\" before she started having ketamine infusions for her depression.Courtesy: Tiffaney Ritchey/Facebook\\n\\nIn December 2012, Tiffaney Ritchey traveled to Depression Recovery Centers in Scottsdale, Arizona, which was just starting to use an alternative way to help people suffering treatment-resistant depression: ketamine infusions.\\n\\nSuicidal and desperate, she gave it a shot, knowing it might be her last chance.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf the ketamine didnâ\\x80\\x99t work, I was checking out,â\\x80\\x9d she says. â\\x80\\x9cEverything in my life was riding on it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLong used as an anesthetic and sedative in hospital rooms and framed in recent years as a harmful recreational club drug, the perception of ketamine is getting reinvented yet again. This time, through years of research, ketamine is showing promise as a tool for future depression treatments.\\n\\nAbout halfway through her first infusion treatment, Ritchey experienced a happiness she hadnâ\\x80\\x99t felt in years. The feeling from the powerful drug lasted a couple days before she went back for another infusion. As her depression symptoms improved, sheâ\\x80\\x99d go weeks and months between infusions.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe ketamine saved my life,â\\x80\\x9d she says from her home. â\\x80\\x9cEvery time I think about it, I just want to cry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThat optimism about ketamine as a depression deterrent is catching on elsewhere. In the last 15 years, thereâ\\x80\\x99s been a tidal wave of research touting the benefits of ketamine in treating depression. In August, a study from the National Institute of Mental Health discovered that ketamine reduces suicidal thoughts â\\x80\\x93 totally independent of the drug\\'s effect on depression or anxiety. In April, a University of Oxford study in the Journal of Psychopharmacology found that approximately a third of patients with treatment-resistant depression saw immediate improvements in their moods. And since 2012, studies from Yale University, Houstonâ\\x80\\x99s Baylor College of Medicine and New Yorkâ\\x80\\x99s Mount Sinai School of Medicine found that ketamine is overwhelmingly successful for treatment-resistant patients.\\n\\nResearchers are the excited about these developments in hopes of combatting the rising number of depression cases nationwide. Almost 7 percent of Americans 18 or older â\\x80\\x93 about 16 million people â\\x80\\x93 suffered at least one major episode of depression in the last year, according to NIMH. The World Health Organization recently found that â\\x80\\x9cdepression is the predominant cause of illness and disability\" for boys and girls 10 to 19 years old. In the United States, lost productivity and health care expenses from depression cost an estimated $80 billion a year. And those trends are not expected to slow down. National Institutes of Health researchers project depression to be â\\x80\\x9cthe second leading cause of disability worldwide and the leading cause of disability in high-income nations, including the United Statesâ\\x80\\x9d within 20 years.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98The ketamine saved my life. Every time I think about it, I just want to cry.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nNow, more than two years after study author Dr. Ronald Duman, a professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the Yale School of Medicine, said in a press release that ketamine is â\\x80\\x9cthe biggest breakthrough in depression research in a half century,â\\x80\\x9d researchers are still trying to figure out the long-term effects of administering it. As more clinics nationwide offer ketamine intravenous infusions, thereâ\\x80\\x99s also a race in the pharmaceutical industry to see which company will bring a ketamine-like drug to market first.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think anybody really had the hypothesis that this drug was going to have a very rabid, robust response,â\\x80\\x9d says Dr. Gerard Sanacora, director of the Yale depression research program.\\n\\nWhether it was antidepressants or psychotherapy, nothing seemed to help Garrett Brooks.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe was helpless. He was hopeless,â\\x80\\x9d Dr. Glen Z. Brooks said of his son. â\\x80\\x9cHe saw no way out. And there was just nothing that I could do or his mother could do to save him from himself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIn 1999, the 18-year-old committed suicide. Brooks and his wife tried to keep Garrett\\'s memory alive by starting scholarships and donating to charities. But nothing was ever enough.\\n\\nDr. Glen Z. Brooks setting up an intravenous ketamine infusion at his New York office.Timothy Bella\\n\\nBrooks says he\\'s treated about 500 patients since he opened New York Ketamine Infusions in 2012. At his Lower Manhattan office, Brooks says that he\\'s administered more ketamine infusions than any other practitioner in the country. The vast majority of patients are victims of childhood pain and suffering, and are coping with PTSD and manifestations such as depression or eating disorders. No child or adult is turned away.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNothing ever really made a difference for me until I started doing ketamine therapy to treat patients [with] otherwise treatment-resistant depression,â\\x80\\x9d he says. â\\x80\\x9cIt was only then that I really had a chance to save other kids.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBrooks is one of just 18 providers and clinics in the country to offer ketamine infusions, according to the Ketamine Advocacy Network. Now 67, Brooks sees 50 to 55 patients a week, totaling close to 3,000 appointments a year, with each infusion costing around $400. He said he wishes the drug had been available 15 years ago.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think it could have made a tremendous difference,â\\x80\\x9d he said, and then paused for a moment to correct himself. â\\x80\\x9cI know it could have made a difference.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDeveloped in 1962, ketamine was the most widely used battlefield anesthetic during the Vietnam War, as well as a regular anesthetic used in American hospitals. Some veterans began to self-medicate with â\\x80\\x93 and in some cases abuse â\\x80\\x93 ketamine when they returned home. Some mind explorers and New Age spiritualists of the 1970s and 1980s embraced the drug, citing out-of-body experiences, intense visuals and a number of auditory hallucinations that could result from subanesthetic doses.\\n\\nMarcia Moore, heiress to the Sheraton Hotel estate, championed ketamine\\'s supposed existential richness in her 1978 book â\\x80\\x9cJourneys Into The Bright World,â\\x80\\x9d only to become one of the first high-profile deaths linked to recreational use the following year. She is believed to have injected herself with a large dose of ketamine on a winter night in the forest, where she passed out and died of hypothermia.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I think [ketamine] could have made a tremendous difference ... I know it could have made a difference.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nfounder, New York Ketamine Infusions\\n\\nBy the mid \\'80s and early \\'90s, the recreational use of the drug had become a mainstay in the nightclub scene, particularly in New York\\'s dance and rave culture. â\\x80\\x9cSpecial Kâ\\x80\\x9d was regarded as a form of psychedelic heroin, and its recreational use remained legal until 1999, when the federal government classified it a Schedule III controlled substance alongside anabolic steroids and LSD. Anyone who wanted to use, manufacture or sell ketamine had to register with the Drug Enforcement Agency. Today, the recreational use of ketamine and drugs that users are led to believe to be ketamine remains popular in the summer music festival scene.\\n\\nKetamine\\'s reputation as a potentially dangerous party drug frustrates practitioners like Brooks.\\n\\nA vial of ketamine, the longtime anesthetic that is catching on as a depression treatment.Victoria Arocho/AP\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s all just nonsense,â\\x80\\x9d he says. â\\x80\\x9cKetamine is probably in every operating room in the world, with a proven record of safety. Yeah, there has been some use in some clubs over time, but again, weâ\\x80\\x99re talking about doses that far, far exceed the kind of doses we use here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBrooks begins each treatment session with a lengthy discussion on how ketamine infusions affect the patientâ\\x80\\x99s depression symptoms. With his deep, calming voice, lengthy eye contact and smiles at just the right time, patients laud Brooksâ\\x80\\x99 bedside manner. The average first infusion is based on the industry standard of half a milligram per kilogram of a patientâ\\x80\\x99s weight. The drug is diluted in saline and administered intravenously over 45 minutes, often while listening to patients\\' favorite music. After an infusion, patients generally sit quietly for up to 30 minutes before being allowed to leave. Depending on a patient\\'s size and his or her bodyâ\\x80\\x99s response to treatment, the effects last from 30 minutes to a couple hours.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cColors seem a little brighter; music sounds better,â\\x80\\x9d Brooks says of patients\\' response. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s easier to get out of bed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBefore ketamine was considered for treating depression, research on the drug focused on schizophrenia. In the late \\'80s, Dr. John Krystal and his colleagues at Yale began to study ketamine\\'s effects in healthy human subjects, showing how it could produce symptoms associated with schizophrenia, such as dissociative states and changes in the sense of time.\\n\\nOne day, Krystal, who now chairs Yale\\'s Department of Psychiatry, was tossing out â\\x80\\x9cwild and wacky ideasâ\\x80\\x9d with colleagues. One of them stuck.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe began to think about what if we approached depression the way that we were approaching schizophrenia?â\\x80\\x9d Krystal recalls.\\n\\nFifty years of depression research had largely been centered on norepinephrine and serotonin. But Krystal was enamored with glutamate, a neurotransmitter that helps increase cell activity and brain function. When ketamine targeted NMDA receptors, which play a critical role in the central nervous system and help with breathing, walking and learning, it was believed to have the ability to cause brain cells to establish newer and stronger connections. In late-\\'90s ketamine studies, the drug was found to have antidepressant effects for several hours. When Krystal published a 2000 study indicating that ketamine could swiftly lift the symptoms of depression, it was the first research of its kind to make the case. The response from the medical community was â\\x80\\x9cresounding silence, â\\x80\\x9d Krystal said, which â\\x80\\x9cfelt that it was too good to be true.\"\\n\\nDr. John Krystal\\'s research on ketamine\\'s use for depression stretches back to the late 90s.Timothy Bella\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThese were patients who had failed everything in the medicine chest that [the industry] had to offer for the treatment of depression,â\\x80\\x9d he says. â\\x80\\x9cIt was really quite striking and remarkable.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSanacora, who assisted Krystal with the research more than 16 years ago, recalls, â\\x80\\x9cI actually do remember saying, â\\x80\\x98You know, if this is real, this is going to be something really big.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA few years later, other researchers echoed their results, helping ketamine depression research become a fast-growing field. There wasn\\'t much outright opposition, but thereâ\\x80\\x99s still some skepticism from doctorsabout the hallucinogenic side effects and quiet concern among researchers about some clinicians who administer ketamine treatments. Others say that patients who are so desperate for something to help their depression might be too vulnerable to make informed decisions about ketamine treatment.\\n\\nDr. Alan F. Schatzberg of Stanford University School of Medicine wrote a March 2014 commentary in the American Journal of Psychiatry titled, â\\x80\\x9cA Word to the Wise About Ketamine,â\\x80\\x9d outlining the lack of FDA regulation on the drug being administered off-label in psychiatry clinics that have not received approval from any regulatory agency. Schatzberg argues that the drugâ\\x80\\x99s potential for abuse is significant, with clinics charging hundreds of dollars for off-label infusions that have to be conducted over and over again as upkeep for their depression treatment.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis unbridled enthusiasm needs to be tempered by a more rational and guarded perspective,â\\x80\\x9d Schatzberg wrote. â\\x80\\x9cThe recent ketamine studies are exciting, and they open up important avenues for investigation that should be supported; however, until we know more, clinicians should be wary about embarking on a slippery ketamine slope.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nEven proponents of the research say more studies are needed before further advancing the research. Hong Kong recently reported that ketamine was the second-most popular drug of abuse after heroin. And its recreational use worldwide continues to rise. This concerns Krystal, who says the drug must be treated with respect.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKetamine is a drug that clearly affects the brain in powerful ways and that we have to acknowledge that it does have an abuse liability,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cIn many parts of the world, ketamine abuse is a very substantial public health threat.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDr. Gerard Sanacora looks over research at his office at Yale.Timothy Bella\\n\\nSanacora adds, â\\x80\\x9cI do think we have to move about this in a very cautious, prospective way of thinking about it; not just opening up the flood gates and treating everybody.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWhile the infusion business remains steady, pharmaceutical companies have their eyes on something even more lucrative: a drug that acts like ketamine but without the high. Companies such as Naurex have hundreds of patients in clinical trials and are investing tens of millions of dollars in research on their drugs. Even industry titan Johnson & Johnson is testing and developing a nasal spray thatâ\\x80\\x99s a derivative of ketamine. The goal? To be the first antidepressant that works like ketamine to get approved by the FDA, in hopes of making it to the marketplace within the next decade.\\n\\nCerecor, a privately held Baltimore company of fewer than 15 employees, might be the odds-on favorite to hit the market first. With CERC-301, the companyâ\\x80\\x99s lead program costing around $33 million in research, Cerecor is in clinical trials with a daily pill, the only company thus far to at least explore the idea of a ketamine-acting drug in pill form. Other companies are looking into ketamine-like drugs delivered intravenously. (Editor\\'s note: Naurex is also in the early stages of developing a ketamine-acting oral pill.)\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I actually do remember saying, â\\x80\\x98You know, if this is real, this is going to be something really big.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x99\\n\\ndirector, Yale depression research program\\n\\nBlake Paterson, Cerecorâ\\x80\\x99s founder and a trained anesthesiologist, is aware of the significant toxicities feared in ketamine-like drugs, whether itâ\\x80\\x99s higher blood pressure or potential brain damage, which is why more research is being done.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s not the perfect answer to depression and nothing ever will be,â\\x80\\x9d Paterson says. â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80¦ What weâ\\x80\\x99re all about is trying to address that unmet need.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBack in New York, Brooks welcomes the idea of these new drugs hitting the market down the road, but doesnâ\\x80\\x99t believe intravenous ketamine infusions will go away in the near future.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn 2015, 2016, intravenous ketamine therapy will remain the gold standard for that class of drugs,â\\x80\\x9d he says.\\n\\nGarrett Ritchey says a side benefit to his ketamine infusions was getting rid of his lower back pain.Courtesy: Garrett Ritchey/Facebook\\n\\nBy age 18, Garrett Ritchey was taking regular ketamine infusions for his depression. He had no idea it would also have an effect on the stabbing feeling in his lower back. When Scottsdale doctors removed his IV after an infusion in December, he lost it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was all gone,â\\x80\\x9d says Ritchey, who no longer needs a walker to get around his home. â\\x80\\x9cI had forgotten what it was like to live a pain-free life.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRitchey, like his mother, has gone through dozens of infusions for his depression and chronic pain. Heâ\\x80\\x99s says heâ\\x80\\x99s not dependent on ketamine, and it now serves as more of a boost, going months between infusions. Heâ\\x80\\x99s now focusing on pursuing a music career, playing gigs around his hometown. For Ritchey, the change in his quality of life with ketamine is drastic. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s night and day,â\\x80\\x9d he says.\\n\\nThe same canâ\\x80\\x99t be said of his mother, who remains dependent on ketamine infusions, and it\\'s hurting her pocketbook. In October 2013, the costs of the infusions, between $750 and $1,000, forced Tiffaney Ritchey to temporarily abandon the treatment. Although she has improved as a whole, her depression returns in waves.\\n\\nSheâ\\x80\\x99s come to terms with the severity of her situation, and what she has to do to â\\x80\\x9cpull backâ\\x80\\x9d from her depression.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWith the ketamine, I do stay stable longer,â\\x80\\x9d Ritchey says. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m probably going to need ketamine the rest of my life.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

       "  'text': 'THE O.J. Simpson trial is one reflection of how domestic violence haunts American society. Is \"Gone With the Wind\" another? Specifically, did Rhett Butler rape or, less offensively, ravish Scarlett O\\'Hara?\\n\\nThe debate began a few years back in academic journals and the lecture hall between two feminist philosophers -- one of them Christina Hoff Sommers, who has since outraged many feminists with her book \"Who Stole Feminism? How Women Betrayed Women,\" published last year. The argument in her book -- that feminism is dominated by those who seek to persuade the public that American women \"are not the free creatures we think we are\" -- is foreshadowed in the dispute over Margaret Mitchell\\'s Civil War saga.\\n\\nIn case you missed it, the debate has resurfaced again. Here are excerpts. TOM KUNTZ\\n\\nFrom a speech given last fall to the American Enterprise Institute by Ms. Sommers, an associate professor of philosophy at Clark University in Worcester, Mass., and reprinted in the current issue of The American Enterprise:\\n\\nUntil 1989, I was an academic feminist in good standing. My essays were included in female anthologies. I was invited to feminist conferences. My courses were cross-listed with Women\\'s Studies. I ran afoul of the feminist establishment when I published an essay in the Chronicle of Higher Education that said something politically incorrect about the famous staircase scene in \"Gone With the Wind.\"\\n\\n\"Many women,\" I wrote, \"continue to enjoy the sight of Rhett Butler carrying Scarlett O\\'Hara up the stairs in a fate undreamt of in feminist philosophy.\"\\n\\nI meant that to be both lighthearted and a serious warning that feminist theorists were out of touch with women. However, my remark incensed [ members of ] the Society for Women in Philosophy. . . . [ At a meeting of the society ] the feminist philosopher Marilyn Friedman would read a paper showing once and for all how my views were treasonable to women.\\n\\nThe paper by Ms. Friedman, associate professor of philosophy at Washington University in St. Louis, appeared in the Journal of Social Philosophy (Fall/Winter 1990):\\n\\nSommers\\' remark that Scarlett O\\'Hara\\'s rape by Rhett Butler is a fate undreamt of in feminist philosophy is . . . simply stunning. (Note that Sommers does not use the word \"rape\" here -- one of many omissions in her writings.) Even a passing knowledge of feminist philosophy reveals that rape is hardly undreamt of in it. Rape, of course, is not a dream; it is a nightmare. Any form of sexual aggression can involve coercion, intimidation, degradation, physical abuse, battering, and, in extreme cases, death.\\n\\nThe reality of rape is rendered invisible by the many novels and films, such as \"Gone With the Wind,\" which romanticize and mystify it. They portray the rapist as a handsome man whose domination is pleasurable in bed, and portray women as happy to have their own sexual choices and refusals crushed by such men.\\n\\nIn a culture in which these sorts of betrayals are routine, it is no surprise that this scene arouses the sexual desire of some men. The name of Richard Speck, to take one example, can remind us that all rape is not the pleasurable fantasy intimated in \"Gone With the Wind.\" To put the point graphically: would \"many women\" still swoon over Butler\\'s rape of O\\'Hara if they knew he urinated on her? When you\\'re the victim of a rape, you don\\'t have much choice over what goes on.\\n\\nTo which Ms. Sommers responded in a speech at the same gathering, and reprinted in the same journal:\\n\\nAt the time I made the remark, I was unacquainted with a book that has since come into my hands called \"Scarlett\\'s Women: \\'Gone With the Wind\\' and its Female Fans.\" The feminist author, Helen Taylor, actually did a survey of women who read \"Gone With the Wind\" or saw the movie asking them what they thought happened between Rhett and Scarlett . . .:\\n\\n\" [ T ] he majority of my correspondents (and I agree) recognize the ambiguous nature of the encounter and interpret it as a scene of mutually pleasurable rough sex . . . By far the majority of the women who responded to me saw the episode as erotically exciting, emotionally stirring and profoundly memorable. Few of them referred to it as \"rape.\\' \" . . .\\n\\nSome of you might find Friedman\\'s perverse insistence on rape simply stunning. Well I too find it perverse but I am not stunned. I read quite a lot of what the gender feminists write. And I have learned that they almost always interpret a text in a way that puts the most humiliating construction on women\\'s experiences with men. The gender feminist \"subtext\" of almost everything written about men and women in the patriarchy is rape, prostitution, debasement. . . .\\n\\nRebutting Ms. Sommers\\'s rebuttal of her rebuttal, Ms. Friedman wrote an article for the same issue of the journal:\\n\\nConsider the crucial scene. . . . From the moment of Rhett Butler\\'s first appearance in the novel, his physical power is emphasized: his large size, powerful build and excessive muscularity. . . . O\\'Hara and Butler eventually marry, but their relationship is far from blissful. . . . [ Butler warns ] : \"I\\'m riding you with a slack rein, my pet, but don\\'t forget that I\\'m riding with curb and spur just the same.\" When O\\'Hara expresses her desire to have no more children, [ clearly implying ] that she wishes no further sexual relations, they quarrel. Says O\\'Hara, \"I shall lock my door every night.\" Responded Butler, \"Why bother? If I wanted you, no lock would keep me out.\" This sounds to me like a verbal threat of rape. Is it merely my own \"humiliating construction\" to see it so?\\n\\nThe controversial sexual encounter develops after a drinking bout in which Butler becomes progressively more violent and intimidating. . . .\\n\\n\" \\'Observe my hands, my dear,\\' he said, flexing them. . . . \\'I could tear you to pieces with them with no trouble whatsoever and I would do it if it would take Ashley out of your mind. But it wouldn\\'t. So I think I\\'ll remove him from your mind forever this way. I\\'ll put my hands, so, on each side of your head and I\\'ll smash your skull between them like a walnut and that will blot him out.\\' \" . . .\\n\\n\"He swung her off her feet into his arms and started up the stairs. Her head was crushed against his chest. . . . He hurt her and she cried out. . . . Up the stairs, he went in the utter darkness, up, up, and she was wild with fear. . . . He stopped suddenly on the landing and, turning her swiftly in his arms, bent over her and kissed her with a savagery and a completeness that wiped out everything from her mind but the dark into which she was sinking and the lips on hers.\" . . .\\n\\nBy the time Butler gets to genital penetration, O\\'Hara is sexually aroused. Whether or not that makes her a willing participant is a further debatable point. Since it is debatable (although I would argue for the negative), [ the ] narrow notion of rape does not apply automatically. However, I use the term \"rape\" in a wider sense, in which it refers to any very intimate sexual contact which is initiated forcibly or against the will of the recipient. Perhaps . . . we should refer to this wider notion as \"sexual domination.\" . . .\\n\\nYes, O\\'Hara becomes aroused by the encounter. That is precisely what some feminist theorists have objected to: she becomes aroused by being sexually dominated. . . .\\n\\nIn her own words of recollection the next morning, as written by Margaret Mitchell, O\\'Hara has been \"humbled,\" \"hurt,\" and \"used . . . brutally.\" O\\'Hara, it seems to me, has a more credible understanding of her own experience than does Sommers. . . .\\n\\nNot to be outdone, Ms. Sommers responded in the journal the following spring:\\n\\nIn her second go at me Friedman has changed her tune about what did take place. She no longer compares Rhett Butler to Richard Speck and she acknowledges that the \"narrow notion\" of \"rape\" may not apply. . . . Thus Friedman insists that even when \"no\" turns to \"yes,\" a rape has occurred. . . . She now finds herself in the position of conceding to the macho male the sexist thesis that women like the idea of being raped (in the \"wider sense\").\\n\\nPhoto: Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh in \"Gone With the Wind.\" (MGM)',\n",

       "  'text': 'The Great Depression began on Thursday, Oct. 24th, 1929. It would become known as “Black Thursday,” and rightfully so. The stock market crashed, and a record 13 million shares were traded that day. Some of the larger banks tried to help by buying shares at above the quoted prices. It didn’t work. Several corporations suffering today — General Motors , General Electric , Sears — were in dire straits. Some companies’ stocks dropped 50%. After five days, banks began to close. Most depositors were left “holding the bag,” and an empty one at that!\\n\\nWe were an average blue-collar family in Altoona, Pa. My father worked at the silk mill, as a shipping clerk and later as a supervisor. As businesses in Altoona cut back and then closed entirely, the silk mill did too. My father had a backup career, giving piano lessons and playing in a five-piece band for weddings and other events. As the Depression got worse, though, those things were no longer affordable. He took a job as an insurance agent. But people didn’t have the money to buy more insurance.\\n\\nI was in the sixth grade in 1929. I got a job at our grocery store, stocking shelves for 25 or 50 cents a day, plus a bag of penny candy. My sister, Charlotte, who was in the third grade, helped Mother with chores and meals and made her own doll clothes out of odds and ends. We “patched” holes in our shoes by lining the insides of the soles with the cardboard separators from old Shredded Wheat boxes. Mother was a great cook. She got vegetables from other families in our neighborhood and made soup. Our butcher would give us soup bones (leaving a little meat on it), free of charge. He remembered that we were good customers in good times.\\n\\nWe couldn’t go to the movies on Saturdays anymore. But we kids had no trouble finding fun things to do. We had a makeshift baseball diamond in the city park. There were eight or 10 of us, and not everyone had a glove. So we would just keep swapping. A ball lasted us a long time. When the cover came off, we would get black friction tape and wrap the ball with it. Eventually we would all have to contribute the pennies we had saved to buy a new ball.\\n\\nWe also had a favorite swimming hole about 10 miles away. We would ride there on our bicycles. Somehow everybody managed to have their own bike. My father’s friend had an old bike gathering dust in his basement, so he gave it to me. We had to work on it, but it lasted me a long time. We also made our own scooters. We’d get a wooden soap box from the grocery store, a three-foot piece of 2×4, and a pair of old roller skates. Soon we were set to go.\\n\\nThings didn’t get easier for a long time, but we managed. My last two years in high school, I got two part time jobs — ushering at the State Theater, for 25 cents an hour, and delivering special-delivery letters and small packages on my bike for the Altoona Post Office. I was paid a percentage of the postage, and sometimes I made $4 on a weekend! When my father was no longer with us, we couldn’t afford the $35 a month to stay in our home. Luckily, we got an apartment across from the Dutch Kitchen, where my mother got a waitress job. My mother liked her job and made good tips. On a good day, she would make as much as $10.\\n\\nWe got through it. In 1932 Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected our 32nd president and brought with him a number of wonderful programs and signs of recovery. I graduated from high school in1935 and went to work as a meter reader for Penn Edison. Charlotte graduated three years later and got a job as a secretary. Things just seemed to get better as time went on.\\n\\nSo now it’s 2008. We’re now in the midst of another financial crisis — this one global — brought about presumably by “the powers that be” on Wall Street and in the upper echelons of the federal government. A classic display of selfishness, greed, and politics. I’m 91 years old, and I sure don’t want to see another Great Depression. But I wouldn’t part with the experience I had 80 years ago. I learned that we could do without things that we thought we had to have. I learned how to “stretch” a dollar. And I learned that the words on the back of the dollar bill, “In God We Trust,” have merit. Hoping and praying isn’t all we need to do, but it helps.\\n\\nWalter Stoiber is my uncle and an amazingly healthy 91-year-old. He lives with his wife, Dorothy, in Boardman, Ohio, outside of Youngstown. Charlotte, his sister and my mother, died at 87 in January.',\n",

       "  'text': 'On April 4, 1991, Mary Joe Frug, a prominent feminist legal scholar at the New England School of Law in Boston, was hacked to death on the streets of Cambridge. Wielding a military-style knife with a 7-inch-long blade, her assailant, as yet unknown, stabbed her four times.\\n\\nOn April 4, 1992, the Harvard Law Review held its annual gala banquet, when the torch of the nation\\'s most prestigious legal journal is passed to a new generation of editors. Among those invited: the murdered woman\\'s husband, Gerald Frug, a member of the Harvard Law School faculty. Had he attended, he would have found on his plate a parody of his wife\\'s last article. The parody, titled \"He-Manifesto of Post-Mortem Legal Feminism,\" was produced by the Law Review\\'s editors and paid for by the school. It depicted Ms. Frug as a humorless, sex-starved mediocrity and dubbed her the \"Rigor-Mortis Professor of Law.\"\\n\\nThe alleged satire poses a question that is certain to outlast all the finger-pointing, ducking, blaming, petitioning and posturing that has overtaken Cambridge in the nearly two weeks since the \"joke\" came to light: how can Harvard\\'s best and brightest, the men and women who will soon write the opinions of some of the nation\\'s most powerful judges, also be its cruelest and crudest?\\n\\nEarlier this year, Ms. Frug\\'s article, \"A Postmodern Feminist Legal Manifesto (An Unfinished Draft),\" appeared posthumously in the Harvard Law Review. Several conservative editors fought unsuccessfully to block the piece, a bluntly worded examination of how, Ms. Frug maintained, the law perpetuated the subjugation of women.\\n\\nAs the banquet approached, the Law Review\\'s editors, their coveted, career-making judicial clerkships in hand, turned their efforts to the Harvard Law Revue, an annual send-up of the publication. Along with others who had opposed publication of the Frug article, Craig Coben and Kenneth Fenyo set about to lampoon it.\\n\\nThe result was a five-page, footnote-laden parody, saturated with inside jokes and sexual innuendoes. The article was purportedly dictated \"from beyond the grave\" by one Mary Doe, described as the \"Rigor-Mortis Professor of Law, New England School of Law, 1981-1991\" and \"wife of Gerald Frug, Professor of Law, Harvard Law School.\" In it, Ms. Doe recounts childhood sexual fantasies about men in tight swim trunks, defended the use of obscenities in her scholarly work, and reflected on \"the irony that I, a postmodern feminist, am being published because of my husband\\'s tenure here.\"\\n\\n\"Postmodern feminists represent a diverse group of people,\" the parody continued. \"Some of us are intellectuals. Many are politically committed. Most are disillusioned. Others are just plain horny. But there is one thing that we have in common: we have no sense of humor.\"\\n\\nAs the article began to circulate over the next few days, the adjectives flew. Andrea Brenneke, a third-year law student and one of many women to speak out, called the parody \"a perpetuation of the forces that killed Mary Joe Frug.\" In an open letter, nearly every member of the Harvard law faculty called it \"contemptible and cruel.\" As usual, Laurence H. Tribe and Alan Dershowitz weighed in with their observations. More criticism came -- to his many critics, belatedly and begrudgingly -- from Dean Robert C. Clark.\\n\\nThen came the apologies. The eight editors who oversaw the Revue called the takeoff \"tasteless\" and \"offensive.\" This group included David Ellen, the Review\\'s outgoing president, and Paul Clement, who will clerk one year hence for Justice Antonin Scalia at the United States Supreme Court. The two women among them filed a concurring mea culpa. Mr. Coben and Mr. Fenyo abjectly apologized as well, though they noted that none of their colleagues ever objected to what they wrote, at least until the whole school came down on them.\\n\\nMr. Coben, Mr. Fenyo and Mr. Ellen did not return a reporter\\'s phone calls. But in the fecund tradition of Harvard analyzing Harvard, others offered ample explanations for the debacle: the moral vacuousness of legal education; the sexist zeitgeist; the fractious political climate at Harvard; jangled gender politics in the era of Clarence Thomas, William Kennedy Smith and Mike Tyson; the peculiar combination of intelligence and isolation, sophistication and uncouthness, ignorance and arrogance that characterizes a few students at a few elite law schools.\\n\\nParticularly those students with clerkships in hand. Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg of the United States Court of Appeals in Washington, for whom Mr. Coben will work next year, did not return a phone call. But Mr. Fenyo\\'s future mentor, Judge J. Clifford Wallace of the Court of Appeals in San Diego, seemed disinclined to reconsider his offer in light of the parody. \"I haven\\'t seen it,\" he said. \"I haven\\'t heard anything about it. I\\'m really not even interested in it.\"',\n",

Scott, professor of history at Brown University, in her keynote address. She said the Surgeon General-designate, Dr. C. Everett Koop, was a foe of abortion, that the Attorney General's office was being staffed ''with assistants whose careers have been dedicated to the abolition of affirmative action'' and that ''the only high-ranking woman in the Administration gives no cause for celebration.''\\n\\n''Jeane Kirkpatrick is not someone I want to represent feminine accomplishment,'' she said, speaking of the chief delegate to the United Nations.\\n\\nCiting examples of women in academic fields, Professor Scott observed that although there was little reason for optimism about what had been gained in the 1970's, the situation today was even less hopeful.\\n\\n''The circumstances of the 1980's bring to mind the 1920's and 30's,'' she said. ''Then, after the triumph of winning the vote, women faced a well-organized antifeminist movement which struck at the cultural and political bases of female solidarity.''\\n\\nParticipants in a panel on ''The Subordinate Role'' agreed that women neither accepted nor rejected it, but rather created strategies of survival and liberation somewhere between subordination and rebellion. Bonnie S. Anderson of Brooklyn College, the chairman, pointed out, too, the panelists' unanimous belief that women attempting to emerge from traditional subordinate roles found cultural restraints even more burdensome than economic limitations.\\n\\nKathleen Stassen Berger reported that five studies of more than 600 high-achieving women had found that a supporting network was of more assistance than education and paid employment in helping women realize their potential.\\n\\nFathers who encouraged autonomous development were found to be more influential in their daughters' lives than were mothers. Elder siblings were important by their absence. A disproportionate number of the women surveyed were first-borns, and of those who had elder siblings, they were more likely to be elder sisters than big brothers.\\n\\n''I suspect that big brothers themselves slow down the independence of the little sister, as they denigrate her accomplishments and 'protect' her from the outside world,'' said Professor Berger, of Bronx Community College of the City University of New York. She mentioned, as well, the prevalence, in the lives of the women studied, of a relationship with a mentor, usually a man, and the lack of husbands and children.\\n\\nGerda Lerner, professor of history at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, was one of the star attractions at the most widely attended panel. More than 500 people heard the new president of the Organization of American Historians outline ''A General Theory of Women in History.''\\n\\nThe hour-long talk, a condensation of a book in progress, advanced the thesis that the oppression of women was the model for the invention of slavery.\\n\\n''The oppression of women antedates slavery and made it possible,'' she said. The difference in the aspirations of the women's movement, as it is perceived, and those of women in minority groups was outlined by Marquita L. James, Eleanor Smith and Shirlene Soto in a panel entitled ''Toward Sisterhood? Problems and Goals.''\\n\\n''The women's movement seems to be too white, too middle class, too much a reflection of the larger society. It embraces stererotypes about minority women too readily,'' said Professor Soto, who is in the history department at the California Polytechnic State University.\\n\\nShe said, ''To the chicana, it makes little difference if she is unemployed because she is a woman or because she is chicana.'' ''Black women believe they are oppressed not by black men but by white society,'' said Professor James, of Nassau Community College in Garden City, L.I. ''Black women are almost unanimous in their insistence that their own liberation depends on the liberation of their race and the improvements of the life of the black community. White feminists must immediately begin to recognize that black women are foremost victims of oppression in this country because of their color, not their sex.''\\n\\nProfessor Smith of the University of Cincinnati offered suggestions to further mutual respect and reciprocal support. White women should examine their roles in contributing to a racist society, she said, black women should take greater strides against allowing others to speak for them and nonwhite women should ''cease trying to be white and become politically conscious of their plight as a minority and accept themselves historically and culturally.''\\n\\nFeminist perspectives on women's higher education were discussed by Florence Howe of the State University of New York, Old Westbury, L.I.; Elizabeth A. Daniels and Barbara J. Page of Vassar, Laurel Furumoto of Wellesley and Grace Haddad of Lake Erie College in Painsville, Ohio.\\n\\nOutlining conclusions based on studies of Stanford and Wellesley, Professor Howe said that higher education still resides in a universe in which maleness and femaleness are ranked, and in which women's colleges continue to be seen as not mainstream, without the power to effect change.\\n\\nSandi Cooper, president of the conference, was chairman of ''Government Surveillance and the Control of Women,'' one of the most discussed panels of the conference. Among the participants were Blanche Wiesen Cook of John Jay College, who spoke on ''The Repression and Resistance of Women in America, from the F.B.I. to the Moral Majority,'' and Amy Swerdlow of Sarah Lawrence College, who discussed the 1962 confrontation between the Women's Strike for Peace and the House Committee on Un-American Activities. Bettina Aptheker of the University of California at Santa Cruz told of her own experiences of surveillance, imprisonment, beatings and rape as a political activist during the 1960's.\\n\\nOther panels included papers by Elizabeth Pleck of the Wellesley College Center for Research on Women, on how life in the United States challenged the patriarchal authority of the Old World family, and by Diana Grossman Kahn, a clinical psychologist at the Bunting Insitute, Radcliffe College, who raised the possibility that some women's aspirations were related to their mother's lost ambitions.\\n\\nIllustrations: photo of Joan Scott photo of Sandi Cooper and Gerda Lerner\",\n",

Ironically, the street protests may even help him, by reinforcing the fear amongst European partners that Greece is close to social collapse.\\n\\nThe Greek government is a coalition, and it\\'s under enormous pressure because of the economic crisis.\\n\\nHere Greek analyst Nick Malkoutzis argues that it may not hold together under the strain of trying to impose more tax-rises and cuts on social spending.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Greek economy continues to contract at an alarming rate. Since the recession began, the economy has shrunk by almost 25 per cent.\\n\\nUnemployment is also at around 25 per cent, although it\\'s much higher for young people. No wonder Greeks talk about a \"depression\" rather than a \"recession\".\\n\\nIn central Athens, a third of small shops have closed. All the evidence suggests that the cuts imposed by the Troika (the IMF, the European Central Bank and the European Commission) have contributed to this dramatic situation. And now a new round of cuts is on the way.\\n\\nBut the Troika can\\'t take all the blame. If successive Greek governments had made a greater effort to improve tax collection and reform sclerotic parts of the public sector, state finances would now be in better condition, and Greece would not be under renewed pressure to cut spending.\\n\\nWhen Greece was given a second bailout earlier this year, it hoped to reduce its overall debt to 120 per cent of GDP by the year 2020.\\n\\nMany economists now say this is impossible, and that if Greece is to ever recover, it will need yet more debt forgiveness. All this is very depressing.\\n\\nAnd, unfortunately, the political situation is also alarming. The most recent opinion polls show the neo-Nazi Chrysi Avgi (Golden Dawn) party in third place in the polls, ahead of the now discredited Socialist PASOK.\\n\\nChrysi Avgi is a violent, racist movement. In desperation, Greeks are looking for extreme solutions.\\n\\nThere is a widespread contempt for authority. During Wednesday\\'s march, I was struck by the fury many people around me had for the Greek police.\\n\\nThey shouted \"traitors\", and much worse, and applauded sarcastically as the officers marched by.\\n\\nThese people were not the hooded youths who had come spoiling for a fight, but rather, ordinary citizens who had come on the march because they see no light at the end of the tunnel.\\n\\nIf the economic crisis has taught them anything, it is that those in charge cannot be trusted.\\n\\nFollow Barnaby Phillips on Twitter: @BarnabyPhillips',\n",

       "  'text': 'By Barry Eichengreen Special to CNN\\n\\nEditor\\'s Note: Barry Eichengreen is George C. Pardee and Helen N. Pardee Professor of Economics and Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley. He is the author of \"Golden Fetters: the Gold Standard and the Great Depression, 1919-1939.\"\\n\\nBarry Eichengreen says strong action should be taken to stop the financial crisis from getting worse.\\n\\nBERKELEY, California (CNN) -- Every time the economy and stock market turn down, financial historians get predictable calls from reporters.\\n\\nCould this be the start of another Great Depression? Could \"it\" possibly happen again? My stock answer has always been no.\\n\\nThe Great Depression resulted from a series of economic and financial shocks -- the end of a housing bubble in 1926 and the end of a high-tech bubble in 1929 -- but also from truly breathtaking neglect and incompetence on the part of policymakers.\\n\\nIt couldn\\'t happen again precisely because policymakers know this history. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is a student of the Great Depression. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson remembers the mistakes of Andrew Mellon, Herbert Hoover\\'s treasury secretary.\\n\\nWe can be confident, I always answered, that there will not be another Great Depression because policymakers have read financial histories like mine. At least that was my line until recently. Now I have stopped taking reporters\\' calls.\\n\\nThe first thing that made the Great Depression great, of course, was the Fed\\'s failure to act. It basically stood by as the banking system and the economy collapsed around it. This time, in contrast, the Fed can hardly be criticized for inaction. Not only has it cut rates, but it has rolled out one new unprecedented initiative after another.\\n\\nUnfortunately, it has reacted more than acted. First, it provided funds to the commercial banks. Then, it targeted broker-dealers. Now, it is desperately propping up the commercial paper market. All the while however, the problem has been infecting new parts of the financial system.\\n\\nOne thing that restrained the Fed in the 1930s was the fear that rate cuts might cause capital to flee to other countries and the dollar to crash. The danger was that the same liquidity that the Fed poured in through the top of the bucket might just leak back out through these holes in the bottom.\\n\\nThere was a solution: coordinated rate cuts here and in Europe. Unfortunately, central bankers couldn\\'t agree on what was needed. The result was further instability.\\n\\nThat central banks have learned this lesson of history and now see the need for coordinated action is at least one ground for hope. The problem is that they have already used their bullets. iReport.com: What lessons have your family passed down from the Great Depression?\\n\\nU.S. Treasury bill rates have essentially fallen to zero, and the Fed\\'s policy interest rates are only slightly above that level. Central banks are out of ammunition. This is no longer a problem they can solve by themselves.\\n\\nWhat is needed now is Treasury action to address what has morphed into a global banking crisis. Between 1930 and 1933, not just the U.S. but also Europe and Latin America experienced rolling banking crises.\\n\\nWhen Austria took desperate measures to prop up its banking system, its banking crisis only shifted to Germany. When Germany did the same, the crisis spread to the United States.\\n\\nThis was beggar-thy-neighbor policy at its worst. We have seen some disturbing evidence of the same in recent weeks, as when Ireland unilaterally guaranteed all bank deposits and thereby sucked funds out of the British banking system.\\n\\nG7 leaders, when they meet in Washington at the end of this week, need to explain exactly how they will address this aspect of the problem. They need to commit money to recapitalizing their banking systems -- now, and not next week.\\n\\nThe U.K., which has just announced a $50 billion plan for bank recapitalization, has shown how this can be done in a matter of days. But a coordinated initiative will require the U.S. to put up a considerably larger sum.\\n\\nMy recommendation would be to abandon the idea of reverse auctions for toxic assets and instead use the $700 billion of the recently passed rescue plan for bank recapitalization. Although the Great Depression started in 1929, it took until 1933 for American leaders to grasp this nettle and recapitalize the banks. We can\\'t afford to wait for years this time around.\\n\\nA final thing that made the Great Depression such a catastrophe was that some of the worst shocks occurred right before the 1932 presidential election. There then followed an extended interregnum between the election and inauguration of the new president when no one was in charge.\\n\\nThe outgoing president, Hoover, asked his successor designate, Franklin Roosevelt, to cooperate with him on joint statements and policies, but FDR refused to do so. Meanwhile, the banking crisis deepened. Corporations failed.\\n\\nThe economy was allowed to spiral downward. It was this disaster that led us to amend the constitution to shorten the time between presidential election and inauguration from 4 to 2½ months.\\n\\nThe implication is clear. The two presidential candidates should be assembling their financial SWAT teams now. Paulson should promise that they will be invited into his office on November 5. This problem cannot wait until Inauguration Day.\\n\\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.\\n\\nAll About Ben Bernanke • Henry M.

       "  'text': '(Image credit: AFP/Getty Images via @daylife)\\n\\nIn February, 2009, I wrote for the Wall Street Journal an article entitled Reaganomics versus Obamanomics. The article explained that the emerging Obamanomics was pursuing exactly the opposite of every policy of the enormously successful Reaganomics, and predicted that it would produce exactly the opposite results.\\n\\nWell, the results are in, and under President Obama the American people have now suffered the worst 5 years since the Great Depression, as first explained by Steve McCann of the American Thinker on January 25. McCann writes,\\n\\n“From 2009 through 2012, the Obama cabal, and their allegiance to statist policies, has been in charge for four years. The global financial crisis took place in the previous year, 2008 [remember the Democrat majority Congress was elected in 2006], and based on the historical pattern of American economic recovery since the depression years, the United States should have been experiencing broad and significant economic and job growth by year three at the latest.”\\n\\nInstead what America got by year five was fewer jobs than before. Even though the employment age population has increased by nearly 12 million since January, 2008, there are now 3 million fewer Americans working, with employment declining from 146.3 million in January, 2008 to 143.3 million in December, 2012. If America enjoyed the same labor force participation rate as in 2008, the unemployment rate in December, 2012 would have been 11.4%, compared to 4.9% in December, 2007, under President George Bush and his “failed” economic policies of the past. We won’t see 4.9% unemployment in America again until the statest takeover of America is purged.\\n\\nAs I have previously recounted here, before this latest spooky downturn, since the Great Depression recessions in America have lasted an average of 10 months, with the longest previously at 16 months. The latest recession began in December, 2007. Yet here we are 62 months after the recession began, and there is hardly any recovery at all.\\n\\nI have explained in previous columns that the financial crisis was caused by government, not Wall Street, which was just another victim of bad government policies. Those policies began in 1995 with President Clinton and his Executive Branch, regulatory, National Home Ownership Strategy, which was to sold as a program to expand home ownership without costing the taxpayers a dime. The regulations imposed under that strategy effectively looted the banks by trashing traditional lending standards, in the name of “fairness” of course (can’t exclude those not creditworthy from home ownership). That is how the subprime mortgage market exploded from 5% of all mortgages in 1994 to half of all mortgages by 2007.\\n\\nPresident Bush exacerbated the problem, further pumping up the housing bubble with his cheap dollar monetary policy, under the illogical, outdated, Keynesian thinking that a cheap dollar expands the economy by promoting exports. These real causes of the financial crisis have now been well documented, in such books as The Great American Bank Robbery, by Paul Sperry, Reckless Endangerment, by New York Times reporter Gretchen Morgenson, Getting Off Track, by Stanford Economics Professor John Taylor, The Financial Crisis and the Free Market Cure: Why Pure Capitalism is the World Economy’s Only Hope, by Cato Institute President John Allison, and Bad History, Worse Policy: How A False Narrative About the Financial Crisis Led to the Dodd-Frank Act, by Peter Wallison, Senior Fellow for Financial Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute.\\n\\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research officially scored the recession as ending in June, 2009, still the longest recession since the Great Depression at 18 months. President Obama’s responsibility was to adopt the pro-growth policies that would generate a timely, robust recovery. But he has consistently followed the opposite, anti-growth policies, producing the worst recovery since the Great Depression, as economist John Lott originally noted.\\n\\nNo, Obama apologists can’t say the recovery has been so bad because the recession was so bad, as the American historical experience is the worse the recession the stronger the recovery. Obama was poised to be a national hero given his perfect timing, with the typical post recession boom starting in his first year. Obama and his people were expecting to ride that glory, with their statements regarding a supposed recovery summer in 2010, and Obama himself saying on national TV in 2009 that if he didn’t get the recovery going within 3 years, he would be a one term President. They knew the history.\\n\\nAnd, no, you can’t say this time was different because it was a “financial crisis.” Every recession involves a financial crisis, and still the worse the recession the stronger the recovery. That financial crisis excuse is just boob bait propaganda for the gullible. Every other recession and recovery in America since the Great Depression has followed the above described patterns. But not this time, because Obama was busy transforming America from the most prosperous nation in the history of the world, into another banana republic.\\n\\nThat is why last month, 61 months after the recession began, unemployment was still rising, even while record numbers continued to drop out of the work force. The unemployment rate for blacks was still well into double digits at 13.8%, for Hispanics still nearly double digits at 9.7%, for teenagers, continued depression at 23.4%, for black teenagers, a genocidal 37.8%. The official U6 unemployment rate, counting those who were working part time because they couldn’t find full time work, and those marginally attached to the work force who wanted and were available for work for up to a year, was 14.4%.\\n\\nObama constantly proclaims himself the champion of the middle class. But that is just more Saul Alinsky strategy, enact socialism while proclaiming you are doing it for the middle class (which is actually getting taken). During the last 5 years, real median household income has declined nearly 9%, from $54,489 at the end of 2007, to $50,020 at the beginning of 2012. That was the most precipitous plunge on record, with a greater fall after the recession ended than before, which is unprecedented in American history. McCann adds, “While American incomes were rapidly eroding, the cost of living continued to rise as the commodity price index (basket of food, fuel and other essential commodities) rose 20% from December 2007 until September, 2012.”\\n\\nWe know Obama loves the poor, because he has created so many of them. Poverty has soared under Obama, with the number of Americans in poverty increasing to the highest level in the more than 50 years that the Census Bureau has been tracking poverty. Over the last 5 years, the number in poverty has increased by nearly 31%, to 49.7 million, with the poverty rate climbing by over 30% to 16.1%. Obama has also been the food stamp President, with the number on food stamps increasing during his Administration to an all time record high of 47.7 million, up 80% over the past 5 years.\\n\\nThis is all because there has been no real economic growth under President Obama, even though America was coming out of the recession in his first year, and so economic growth should have been higher than normal. Economic growth is the foundation for job creation, and is far more beneficial than redistribution for the middle class and the poor, who will never gain when there is a shrinking pie. Over the last 5 years, the economy has grown at an average annual rate of 0.6%, less than one fifth the long term American growth rate.\\n\\nSure there was a recession in 2008-2009. But the economy is supposed to come booming out of the downturns, averaging back out to the long-term American growth rate. But that hasn’t happened under Obamanomics. That is the core failure of President Obama.\\n\\nInstead, in the fourth quarter of 2012, 5 years after the recession started, the economy was contracting again, with negative growth. One more quarter of that, and we will be back in recession, with the Fed already laying the groundwork for worse after that. The supposedly progressive Obama is leading us back into an historical reenactment of the 1930s.\\n\\nYet, while the economy has not been growing, government spending has been booming. Federal spending has increased by 41% over the last 5 years, with total government spending at all levels increasing by nearly 27%, to an all-time high of $6.2 trillion. The Democrat party controlled press told us the economy contracted in the fourth quarter because of government spending cuts. But there have been no government spending cuts. The government in the fourth quarter was spending more than ever before in world history.\\n\\nFinally, despite all of President Obama’s prattle about inequality, inequality is actually worsening under his Administration. Obama said in his second inaugural address, “our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'My Twitter followers already know that I’m profoundly unimpressed by the latest cover story from the Atlantic magazine titled ‘Why Women Still Can’t Have It All.’\\n\\nThe piece, written by Anne-Marie Slaughter, explains why she left a job at the State Department to return to her tenured position at Princeton. In her words:\\n\\nI realized that I didn’t just need to go home. Deep down, I wanted to go home. I wanted to be able to spend time with my children in the last few years that they are likely to live at home, crucial years for their development into responsible, productive, happy, and caring adults.\\n\\nSlaughter then goes on to extrapolate that women can’t ‘have it all,’ that is full satisfaction and success in their work and home lives. That’s because, she says, workplaces don’t allow enough flexibility for women to make time for their children. And women, she claims, are inherently more committed to being with their children than men, so marriages in which men do the lion’s share of parenting will still leave women feeling emotionally unfulfilled.\\n\\nThere is so much that is wrong with this argument:\\n\\n1. Slaughter’s article is written from a vantage point of extreme privilege. Most women aren’t making choices – they ‘do it all’ because there is no other option. Most women and men would regard a tenured job at Princeton as a high-powered full-time career; Slaughter sees it as a form of settling after giving up her State Department gig. The idea that this is a woman who doesn’t ‘have it all’ is hard to swallow.\\n\\n2. Then there is the essentialism of her claims about the need to make the economy more flexible for women. Women, she says, should not have to see success as meaning working round the clock; women should be encouraged to take more time off. But men, it seems, should be allowed to go on as they have been, working nights and weekends and rarely seeing their children. Because, Slaughter says, it will bother fathers less to have their spouses or a nanny looking after their kids than it will bother mothers.\\n\\nThis is the kind of claim that demands data, and Slaughter has none. She doesn’t make room for women who don’t want children at all, or acknowledge that a great many men hate the pressure put on them to be breadwinners only and fear the ridicule that comes from suggesting they might want to do more parenting.\\n\\n3. Her proposals are weak. The idea that more women in public office will lead to a dramatic change in economic policy for women is a nice thought, but it’s not necessarily true. The suggestion that mandating more parental leave will help is naïve: either only women will take it, furthering the achievement gap at work, or men will take it too, but might use it as a sabbatical to advance their careers or take a vacation, not to focus on parenting. This is one of the many cases where cultural change cannot be simply legislated.\\n\\n4. But, what perhaps bothered me most about the piece, was Slaughter’s narrow understanding of what feminism is. She claims that feminism promised women the following: the ability to have a completely unencumbered, full-time career and a completely involved, cook-dinner-every-day experience of motherhood without making any compromises. This is a straw man.\\n\\nShe counters it with an equally bogus vision of what feminism is: that we validate whatever paths women choose as feminist choices because women make them. This isn’t feminism, because it does nothing to advance the lot of women overall.\\n\\nHere’s what I mean: Slaughter seems blissfully unaware of the consequences of an economy in which some or many women opt for greater flexibility to work fewer hours, but men do not. As I’ve written before, the individual choices of couples where women stay home some or all the time have the aggregate effect of dragging down wages and professional success for women generally.\\n\\nFeminism is about equality. Repeat that until it sinks in.\\n\\nFeminism means giving women equal opportunity and fair pay at work. It means a world where taking time off to be a parent is considered equally legitimate for men and women. It means, fundamentally, a world in which men and women have equal access to the full spectrum of human experience.\\n\\nIt does not mean making a world in which each woman does everything at once, the ‘have it all’ fantasy. It does not mean making a world in which each woman does whatever she wants without consequence, the choice fallacy. It means making a world in which each individual (male or female) can make their own compromises (and life will always involve compromises) without taking away opportunities from others.\\n\\nThat is a radical, utopian vision, to be sure, but it is not the utopia Slaughter claims feminism sold her, or the one she would like us to replace it with.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Whenever I talk about the gold standard, usually there is someone who stands up and says “what about the Great Depression?” — like that is some kind of remark that trumps all possible replies.\\n\\nThe Great Depression was, undoubtedly, the time period when the conventional wisdom migrated from a Classical viewpoint, emphasizing money that is stable in value, to a Mercantilist viewpoint, emphasizing money that can be manipulated to cause short-term economic effects.\\n\\nThe main economic problem that they wanted to deal with was unemployment. So, they looked for a way to deal with unemployment via currency manipulation. Seems kind of silly when you put it in those terms, doesn’t it?\\n\\nI think it is important to recognize that this was something of a political tide. Governments around the world had already fully embraced currency devaluation by the time that Keynes’ book The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money came out in 1936. The title alone tells you where Keynes intends to get his employment from, which is good because the book itself is basically unreadable.\\n\\nActually, governments had already gotten rather tired of the “beggar thy neighbor” devaluation game by 1934, and refrained from any more developments there. The U.S. maintained the value of the dollar at $35/oz. of gold from 1934 to 1971.\\n\\nPeople at the time, for the most part, didn’t have the idea that the gold standard system caused the Great Depression. They just wanted to be able to devalue their currencies, and the gold standard system prevented that.\\n\\nThe notion that the gold standard (or anyway, the monetary conditions of the time) was a cause of the Great Depression really came about in the 1960s. I see it mostly as a swipe at the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has been unpopular among libertarian types since it was founded in 1913. So, if you don’t like Federal Reserve, then blame the Great Depression on it. I’m not sure there’s that much more to it than that.\\n\\nThe Fed actually did its job of serving as a “lender of last resort,” as the phrase was understood at the time. This is evidenced by the low and stable short-term interbank lending rates throughout the time period. This is exactly what the Fed was created to do, and it did it.\\n\\nI looked at the 1914-1930 period in considerable detail in the past, and found nothing of any great importance. Currencies were pegged to gold. Thus, the only way for a gold standard to have caused an event of this sort would have been for gold’s value to change suddenly and by a very large degree – something which is historically unprecedented – and for this change to go unnoticed by people at the time.\\n\\nAnd what supposedly caused this dramatic change in value? Some people have tried to blame France, which I find rather laughable if you look at the historical data. France didn’t do anything of any great importance. (One thing I’ve noticed is that almost nobody actually looks at the data, although it is available free online at the St. Louis Fed’s FRASER database.)',\n",

       "  'text': \"After being a closed book for decades, economists have revisited the Great Depression using recent developments in economic theory and quantitative methods. This new research is surprising, as it finds that several aspects of the Depression contrast sharply with long-standing explanations.\\n\\nThe conventional view is that the Depression began as a garden variety recession, which then became the Depression through banking crises and the failure of the Federal Reserve to expand the money supply. This view also argues that the recovery from the Depression was on track until 1937, when the Fed raised bank reserve requirements and President Roosevelt reduced fiscal stimulus.\\n\\nBut the immediate depth and the chronic duration of the Depression are inconsistent with traditional explanations. The Depression did not start as a garden variety recession, but rather was immediately severe, as manufacturing output fell 35% in just the first year of the Depression, before the banking panics and the large declines in the money supply.\\n\\nAnd the Depression lasted far longer than it should have. After 1933, productivity growth was rapid, liquidity was plentiful, the banking system was stabilized, deflation was eliminated and there was plenty of demand stimulus as the Federal Reserve more than doubled the monetary base (currency and bank reserves) between 1933 and 1939.\\n\\nBut despite all of this, the economy didn't come close to returning to trend. By 1939, per-capita consumption relative to trend had not recovered at all, and per-capita hours worked had recovered by only 20%. Investment recovered somewhat, but still remained more than 60% below trend.\\n\\nThe Depression clearly persisted throughout the 1930s, with little recovery. But the recovery failure has been overlooked by economists who judge it based on the growth rate of gross domestic product and on changes in unemployment. A number of economists point to relatively rapid output growth and declining unemployment to conclude that the recovery was on track. But unemployment is a particularly misleading indicator of recovery. It doesn't indicate how much work was restored, as it neither measures job growth nor hours per worker, and it also is impacted by long-term unemployed individuals leaving the labor force.\\n\\nAnd judging recovery based on output growth requires a benchmark. Both empirical and theoretical benchmarks indicate that output growth should have been much faster than it was, particularly given the very rapid productivity growth that occurred.\\n\\nIn fact, almost all of the recovery in output is from productivity rather than from growth in hours worked. The depth and the duration of the Depression are simply unparalleled, either before the 1930s or afterward.\\n\\nWhat specific factors generate such an enormous Depression, and why did it last for more than a decade? A number of economists are currently researching this question and are focusing their attention on labor markets. This is not only because there was little recovery in hours worked, but also because wages in the industrial sectors of the economy were more than 20% above trend by the end of the 1930s.\\n\\nAnd the co-existence of above-market wages and Depression is pathological. Depressions are periods of low employment and low living standards. The normal forces of supply and demand should have reduced wages, which would have lowered business costs and increased employment and output.\\n\\nWhat prevented the normal forces of supply and demand from working? The main culprit appears to be government policies that restricted competition. The National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) was passed in 1933 with the goal of restoring prosperity, and it gave industry the opportunity to explicitly collude, including sanctioning many arrangements that would previously have triggered antitrust activity, such as forming minimum prices and restricting the expansion of capacity within an industry. Cartels were granted under the NIRA in return for industry sharing some of their newfound monopoly profits with workers through large wage increases.\\n\\nMany industries passed codes of fair competition under the NIRA, and industry prices and wages jumped following government approval of these codes. Prices and wages in industries that were unable to reach agreement on a code remained low, as did prices and wages in the agricultural sector, which was not impacted by these policies.\\n\\nWhile the NIRA was ruled unconstitutional, these policies persisted through the passage of the National Labor Relations Act, which substantially increased union bargaining power and led to further wage increases, including substantial increases just before the 1937-38 recession and through the continuation of lax antitrust enforcement.\\n\\nThese policies started to change at the end of the 1930s, however, and hours worked began to rise. By the end of the 1940s, the National Labor Relations Act was significantly modified by the Taft-Hartley Act, industrial wages were back in line with productivity and per capita hours worked were back to their normal level.\\n\\nMore research by both economists and historians is required to gain a more complete understanding of the Great Depression. But almost certainly a satisfactory accounting of this period will focus on why the normal market forces of competition did not work, particularly in industrial labor markets.\\n\\nLee E.

       "  'text': '“We need to slash debt,” declared our friend Nassim Taleb last week on CNBC. Government debt, that is. “Unfortunately, that’s the only solution.” And the most unlikely.\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve’s quarterly Flow of Funds report shows households trimmed their debt 2.4% during the first quarter. Business debt was flat, but local and state government debt grew 4.3% and federal government debt ballooned another 18.5%. Just what do we have to show for it? “We had less debt cumulatively [two years ago],” Taleb says, “and more people employed. Today, we have more risk in the system, and a smaller tax base.\\n\\n“Obama promised us 8% unemployment through stimulus,” continues Taleb. “It hasn’t worked. It’s not that they [the administration] make mistakes, it’s that they almost get nothing right.”\\n\\nThe result of this, both in the U.S. and abroad, is what one of Bill Gross’ top lieutenants at Pimco calls a “Keynesian endpoint.”\\n\\nThe notion of solving debt problems with more debt is increasingly “being seen as a magic elixir that has morphed into poison,” according to an e-mail note from Anthony Crescenzi. “Time, devaluations and debt restructurings might be the only way out for many nations.”\\n\\nPerhaps the U.S. stock market senses this on some subconscious level, which is why it’s exhibiting the sort of financial bipolar disorder we’ve diagnosed the last couple of weeks. Thursday brought us another manic episode, propelling the major indexes up nearly 3% and the Dow past 10,000 again, for no obvious reason. Friday? A depressive episode. Markets opened down nearly 1%. Before the open, the Commerce Department reported a 1.2% drop in retail sales from April to May, the first drop in eight months. This is another one of those “unexpected” numbers that are increasingly whacking traders upside the head.\\n\\nWhere do we go from here? Well, consider the similarities between this market and the one of the 1930s. In both cases, we had a bubble peak and a period of panic selling followed by a rapid rebound. The rebound petered out in April 1930, and perhaps the rally that began in March 2009 is doing the same in April 2010.\\n\\nObviously, there are differences. In 1929, it took only three months to go from peak to trough. This time, it took nearly 18.

       "  'text': 'Americans during the Great Depression voiced the same concerns about excess bank reserves, budget deficits, competitive devaluations and commodities speculation as they do today. Even dissenting arguments followed the same script in both eras. The eerie resemblance in the psychological and economic backdrop of the mid-1930s and 2009--both historic junctures when recovery was thought to have begun--indicates the U.S. tiptoes on the edge of a policy mistake that could hamper the incipient recovery.\\n\\nWhen the U.S. economy began to recover from the Great Depression, widespread fear of credit inflation, currency inflation, public debt inflation and goods/commodities inflation drove the Federal Reserve Board to hike reserve requirements by 50% and prompted Congress to slash spending. A premature retraction of economic stimulus, among other things, pushed the U.S. back into recession.\\n\\nIn the run-up to the 1937 dip, many people thought inflation was imminent due to the jump in excess bank reserves. Commentators also worried about the nation\\'s rising public debt and offered the same alternatives to the New Deal as those who oppose fiscal stimulus spending today: Cut taxes on corporate profits and high-income individuals. They didn\\'t believe in an expansion of the consumer base through a reduction of extreme income inequality. And yes, even during the Great Depression can one find accusations of commodity market speculation for the unseemly rise in goods prices.\\n\\nWhat was the result of acting upon all those fears of inflation in its various forms? In terms of GDP growth, there was a brief recession lasting only about a year from autumn 1937. Business leaders at the time called it a mere \"business recession\" to whittle down excess capacity and high inventories built up in response to rising commodity prices.\\n\\nTo everyone else, particularly those laborers considered \"excess capacity,\" the economy\\'s fragile recovery took a big step back. Deflation took hold of the country for another two years and unemployment spiked to 20% and didn\\'t drop below 15% until 1940. Property prices and stock markets languished below their pre-1929 levels until World War II shocked production back to life. Today the U.S. finds itself headed for a reprise of 1937 with hawks calling for the immediate exit from both loose fiscal and monetary policy even amid high unemployment. Though past is not prologue, learning from past mistakes can make a considerable difference. Policymakers today have the benefit of hindsight to avoid costly policy mistakes at such similar junctures in history.\\n\\n\"Similar\" does not mean \"identical,\" though. There are certain constraints on policymakers today that did not exist in the 1930s: --The U.S. is highly indebted to foreigners, quite the opposite of the situation back in the 1930s.\\n\\n--The U.S. dollar is currently the world\\'s main reserve currency, whereas the British pound held that distinction in the 1930s.\\n\\n--High excess bank reserves in the 1930s were created by bank purchases of government debt issued to finance budget deficits and to purchase gold flowing into the country. In 2009, excess bank reserves grew through banks\\' preference for liquid assets, and the certain (though low) interest earned by deposits at the Federal Reserve.\\n\\nThese constraints set up a situation where the Federal Reserve and Treasury must consider the ramifications of their loose monetary and fiscal policies on the rest of the world. Foreign governments risk overheating and asset bubbles in their economies if they maintain inappropriately low interest rates in order to keep their currencies undervalued vs. the U.S. dollar.\\n\\nIn the 1930s, the U.S. tried to fight off or sterilize hot money inflows; nowadays, it\\'s emerging markets fending off hot money and they are growing tired of financing U.S. deficits. The Federal Reserve and Treasury may face a hard choice between domestic economic recovery and responsible stewardship of the world\\'s global reserve currency and hence global financial stability.\\n\\nMikka Pineda is a research analyst for Roubini Global Economics.

       "  'text': \"Eighty years ago this week, the stock market crashed. Although it was more a symptom of the economy's underlying problems than a cause of the Great Depression, it is still considered the day the worst economic crisis in American history began.\\n\\nI've always been curious about the Great Depression. In fact, I think I decided to study economics because of it. As a child, I remember asking my father about its causes, and he told me that there wasn't enough money for people to spend. I asked where the money went, thinking that vast amounts of currency and coin couldn't have just disappeared. My father explained that most money is in the form of checking accounts, so when the banks failed, a lot of money did just vanish.\\n\\nMy father was not an economist, but somehow he had figured out an essential truth about the cause of the Great Depression that most economists didn't know at the time. I remember my high school history teacher saying that it happened because people suddenly stopped buying cars because the market was saturated; everybody who wanted one owned one.\\n\\nMy college professors weren't much more sophisticated. They talked about a lot of different things--the Smoot-Hawley tariff, the gold standard, international debts et al.--but beneath these specifics was an undercurrent of blame for capitalism itself. It was in its nature, they said, that it generated bubbles that created great hardship when they burst, as the stock market bubble of the 1920s had done in late October 1929.\\n\\nThe idea that capitalism caused the Great Depression was widely held among intellectuals and the general public for many decades. Indeed, there was widespread belief that capitalism bred secular stagnation; consequently, there was enormous fear that the Great Depression would simply start up again where it left off after the temporary prosperity of World War II ended with the war.\\n\\nPolicymakers were united in their desire to make sure this didn't happen if humanly possible. Many postwar institutions such as the World Bank, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and International Monetary Fund were created to fix various problems thought to be responsible for the Great Depression. Congress even passed a law, the Employment Act of 1946, that requires the president to do everything in his power to prevent another depression.\\n\\nTo everyone's great relief, the doomsayers were wrong and secular stagnation did not resume after the war. But as long as there was no satisfactory explanation for the Great Depression, the default position was to blame the private sector, which greatly handicapped conservatives in economic debates about the role of government. Those favoring a free market were at a severe disadvantage against those who said government spending and regulation were the only things standing between prosperity and another Great Depression.\\n\\nFortunately for conservatives, the greatest free market economist of all time, Milton Friedman, found an explanation for the Great Depression that let capitalism off the hook. The fundamental problem, he said, was that the Federal Reserve foolishly allowed the money supply to shrink by a third between 1929 and 1933. Since my father had already told me that the problem in the 1930s was a lack of money, Friedman's explanation made perfect sense to me.\\n\\nA sharp decline in the money supply sets in motion forces that inevitably cause an economic crisis. Because the gross domestic product (GDP)--goods and services sold times their prices--equals the money supply times its rate of turnover, which economists call velocity, then a fall in the money supply of a third is going to necessarily cause nominal GDP to fall by about a third. This will lead to both deflation--falling prices--and falling output.\\n\\nThe faster prices adjust, the faster the economy will turn around and resume growth. The problem is that prices are sticky--they don't adjust quickly to changes in monetary conditions--and wages are even stickier. Getting workers to accept large pay cuts is extremely difficult, especially in heavily unionized industries.\\n\\nAn even bigger problem is that the Fed can't expand the money supply by cutting interest rates because a large deflation would require a negative nominal interest rate. But no bank is ever going to lend at a negative nominal rate, so the zero-bound problem, as economists call it, is a serious barrier to reversing a deflation through monetary policy alone. Also, a deflation magnifies the real burden of debts.\\n\\nBy fingering the Fed's mistakes as the root cause of the Great Depression, Friedman rescued capitalism from blame. Today, I think most economists accept this explanation, although they differ on the appropriate response to the decline in the money supply. Many conservatives still believe the government should have done nothing, or at least different things than it did, because it just made things worse. In particular, conservatives are highly critical of deficit spending during the Roosevelt administration.\\n\\nMost economists do not accept the do-nothing theory. They believe that government must play an active role in stimulating growth when the economy is suffering from a large, sustained deflation. Government spending must compensate for the fall in private spending that results from a deflation--people and businesses will put off buying when they think prices will be lower in the future. Only when spending is again rising will monetary policy become effective; until then it is like pushing on a string to get money circulating and prices rising again.\\n\\nIn the 1930s, there were a number of economists who argued strenuously for a do-nothing policy. But as the Great Depression dragged on and collapsed in 1937--when conservatives were successful in having the federal government slash the budget deficit (it fell from 5.5% of GDP in 1936 to 0% in 1938)--they lost credibility. Economists today generally believe that it was the unprecedented deficits resulting from World War II that actually ended the Great Depression.\\n\\nFortunately for policymakers, every postwar recession until this one occurred under inflationary conditions. This made the readjustment vastly easier because real wages could be cut just by reducing their growth rate to less than the inflation rate; real interest rates could easily be pushed to a negative level if necessary; and Fed policy was always effective.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the current crisis is caused by the same deflationary forces that caused the Great Depression. Monetarists dismiss this argument on the grounds that the money supply has not only not fallen, but in fact has risen sharply. At the end of September, the money supply (M2) was up by $523 billion over a year earlier--a substantial increase. For this reason, they dismiss the idea that government stimulus was necessary to get the economy moving again.\\n\\nWhat my monetarist friends forget is that that the money supply impacts GDP through the velocity multiplier. Normally, it is around 1.9. But it fell to 1.86 in the third quarter of 2008, 1.76 in the fourth quarter, 1.7 in the first quarter of 2009 and 1.69 in the second quarter before rising a bit to 1.72 in the third quarter.\\n\\nThis may not sound like much, but a decline of 10% in the velocity ratio has exactly the same macroeconomic effect as a 10% decline in the money supply. If velocity were still at 1.9, third-quarter GDP would have been $15.8 trillion instead of $14.3 trillion. In other words, there would be no recession.\\n\\nGetting velocity to rise presents policymakers with the same problem they had in the 1930s and requires the same solution: Government spending has to compensate for the falloff in private spending, which should be $1.5 trillion higher based on M2 of $8.3 trillion at the end of September.\\n\\nThe main differences between today's crisis and the Great Depression is that the deflationary pressure is less than a third of what it was in the 1930s and policymakers today reacted much more swiftly and more appropriately than they did after 1929. Those who think the government should have done nothing risked turning the current downturn into another Great Depression. Thankfully, their advice was ignored.\\n\\nBruce Bartlett is a former Treasury Department economist and the author of Reaganomics: Supply-Side Economics in Action and Impostor: How George W.

       "  'text': 'ForbesWoman is a new section for professional and executive women. Enter your email below to start receiving ForbesWoman news and updates.\\n\\nAgainst the backdrop of Iran\\'s political turmoil, Iranian-American journalist Roya Hakakian sat down with ForbesWoman to discuss her native country\\'s current climate and the situation facing women--and men--in Iran today.\\n\\nBorn in Tehran, Hakakian is the author of several collections of poetry and Journey from the Land of No, a memoir. She left Iran in 1984 at the age of 18. She has not returned nor has she been permitted to return. She now lives in Connecticut.\\n\\nExcerpts from her interview with ForbesWoman follow.\\n\\nForbes: What was your first reaction to seeing women among the protesters in the streets of Iran?\\n\\nHakakian: The presence of women is not a surprise to me at all.\\n\\nIran has had a robust women\\'s movement for several decades now. But in the late 1990s, a new generation took charge; and in the early 2000s, they managed to organize and unite in ways that women had not since the revolution in 1979. It started as petition movement to collect signatures to ban stoning women to death and has spun out to become the \"One Million Signatures Campaign.\" So this is precisely what I expected.\\n\\nWhat\\'s the extent of risk these demonstrators are taking?\\n\\nBy looking at pictures and YouTube videos, I can see the regime is using certain tactics: Plainclothes operatives with knives circulate through the crowd and bring out these knives and just as they are feeling safe because they are next to like-minded people who are demonstrating too, the operatives start to attack the protesters.\\n\\nWhen one thinks back to 1978 and 1979 and overthrowing the Shah, it\\'s not remotely comparable. Even though I was young, I could see that the people knew who they were demonstrating against. There was a clear face-off between the Shah\\'s guards and armies and the rest of the people. The boundaries were very clear. This regime doesn\\'t honor that.\\n\\nSome reports have noted the regime\\'s use of non-Persian-speaking police. Because the regime is afraid of the police switching loyalties, it has imported crowd control from other Arab countries so demonstrators on street can\\'t communicate with them. Iranians speak Persian and Arabs speak Arabic so they can\\'t be converted and brought to the other side.\\n\\nWomen are not particular targets. At this point, I don\\'t think it really matters to [the regime] whether it\\'s women, men, young or old.\\n\\nWhat provides some measure of safety is the sheer volume of people that have taken to the streets. In the past 15 years, we have never had one million people marching on the streets of Tehran. Students have marched, yes, but there have been more than a million people demonstrating in the past two to three days. The crowds should are fed up and willing to pay the price.\\n\\nIs this a moment of change for women?\\n\\nYes. The feminist movement, which has been ongoing in Iran, has now joined the broader public movement against the regime. This happened in Iran in the late 1970s too, but it had actually a terrible effect on the women\\'s movement in Iran. Women were somehow \"hoodwinked\" to think that the veil wasn\\'t such an important issue, that it was more important to sacrifice for the greater good. So the Shah went and the veil stayed.\\n\\nThis generation is a lot smarter. The broader social movement is far more sympathetic to the cause of women than in the late 1970s. Thirty years later, Iranian men now realize that their fate is entwined with that of their female counterparts: If women are doing better, then men will do better too.\\n\\nDoes Mousavi\\'s wife--Zahra Rahnavard--in any way represent a new face of women in Iran?\\n\\nHer presence on the political scene is, if anything, a manifestation of the strength of the feminist movement. It was a smart strategy to bring her out and make her visible. Mousavi wanted to court women who constitute a huge voting block and are extremely powerful and know how to organize. So, [Rahnavard] speaks more to the feminist movement than anything else.\\n\\nWhat role has the Internet and modern technology played in helping Iranian women to get their message out?\\n\\nI think it\\'s enormous. I have a Facebook page with several hundred people friending me from Iran. These are people I\\'ve never known. They post photographs, film clips, news items. I haven\\'t looked at any television broadcasts I only look at television broadcasts to measure the lag time between what I\\'ve read [on social networks] and the news networks.\\n\\nWhat have you heard in the last several years about the situation for women in Iran? How have their lives changed or stayed the same?\\n\\nIt varies. Life can be very different for women who live in big metropolis and women who are in more remote parts of Iran. It has been a grand metamorphosis since 1979 when the regime started rolling back women\\'s rights and freedoms that had been extended under the Shah, prior to revolution.\\n\\nThe [religious] regime took a very macho approach to governance and saw rolling back the rights of women as a major priority. It instituted the veil and closed major [academic] fields to women, such as law and engineering.\\n\\nBut [the regime] never counted on the enormous backlash and not just from women who had been used to their freedoms. Challenges came from their \"own\" women too. They said, \"We are Muslim, we wear veils on heads and we want to participate. You told us we are brothers and sisters and as long as we are devout, there will be equal opportunity for everybody.\" The regime encouraged religious women who had never thought of themselves outside of the kitchen and home to come out and take part. And as a result, the women thought they were entitled. That was the part of the game the men had not foreseen.\\n\\nThese women helped cultivate a whole generation that previously was not politically active.\\n\\nAt this point, what\\'s your greatest hope for women in Iran?\\n\\nGreater solidarity and commitment to the cause of women.\\n\\nMuch of what we\\'re seeing right now--what we understand to be the huge social campaign against the rigging of the election--really came from the vast activities over the years of the feminist movement. Women were the ones who put together the infrastructure, who organized demonstrations and knew how to do this. The movement today owes a lot of its existence to the women\\'s movement and the infrastructure the women\\'s movement put in place.\\n\\nWhat can individuals around the world do to help show their support for more equality for women in Iran?\\n\\nA ribbon campaign or bumper stickers.\\n\\nAnd we need to keep this in focus. We are far more connected as human beings than we ever were. Our destinies are entwined with one another. The events of Sept. 11 and the rise of global terrorism is a sad reminder of that.',\n",

       "  'text': 'What\\'s the difference between a financial crisis and a Depression?\\n\\nAt least initially, the symptoms appear similar. Banks won\\'t lend to one another, even overnight. Strong and respected businesses cannot borrow short-term money in the commercial paper market even though their default rates are negligible. The banking systems in many countries have ceased functioning and required major government intervention. It is like a patient experiencing multiple organ failure because the basic circulatory system has gone kaput. Despite urgent measures, the patient appears unresponsive.\\n\\nYes, it\\'s that bad ... but is it the beginning of another Great Depression?\\n\\nThat question has been posed repeatedly--and often feverishly--over the past several weeks. The answer--and I don\\'t mean to be theatrical--is \"No ... but ...\" So first, let\\'s talk about the \"no,\" and then we\\'ll come back to the \"but.\"\\n\\nThe current situation in the U.S. economy is not even slightly good. The financial crisis is global, and real. Nevertheless, the impact on the \"real\" U.S. economy is not yet dire. To date, more than 700,000 jobs have been lost, and we can expect more, but some perspective is in order.\\n\\nThe losses to date represent less than .5% of the work force. In the relatively mild recession of 2001 to 2002, job losses equaled about 1% of the work force. In the much more severe recession of 1981 to 1982, job losses totaled nearly 3% of the labor force--six times today\\'s figure. And in the (truly) Great Depression--invoked, now, with an alarmist frequency--job losses between 1929 and the trough in 1933 were 21% of the labor force; and by 1939, total employment remained 13% below 1929 levels.\\n\\nOutput in the Eurozone economies, as well as Britain, Japan and others, is shrinking; but measured output in the U.S. has yet to decline in the current slowdown. I believe it will shrink, but in the Great Depression, real output shrank by 38% between 1929 and 1933 and remained well below trend for a decade.\\n\\nEvidently, we are a long way from a Great Depression.\\n\\nNow, given the amount of hand wringing that is going on, some of you will assume that I\\'m channeling Mr. Micawber, one of literature\\'s most hapless optimists. The situation is serious, and something has to be done. Unlike Mr. Micawber, I don\\'t expect that \"something will turn up.\"\\n\\nRather, I want to ask the more important question: What do we know about the road that leads from a financial crisis to a severe and prolonged downturn--and how can we avoid it?\\n\\nThe American Great Depression of the 1930s is the most familiar--and most studied--economic collapse, but it is important to know that it is not the only one. Other countries suffered prolonged downturns in the 1930s, and many, including Japan, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, New Zealand, Switzerland and Finland have experienced prolonged episodes of below-trend output in the period since the Great Depression.\\n\\nThe book Great Depressions of the Twentieth Century, edited by Timothy Kehoe and Edward C. Prescott, contains studies of depressions in 14 countries. Harold Cole and Lee Ohanian have done the most in-depth recent research on the American Great Depression, as well as the long decline in the U.K. economy. There is also a terrific book by Amity Shlaes, The Forgotten Man, which reexamines the roots of the Depression.\\n\\nWith all of this scholarship, what do we know about why depressions--whether in upper, or lower, case--occur?\\n\\nNot surprisingly, there isn\\'t one story that fits all of them, but there\\'s a common theme that emerges: It is that unwise policy choices made in the throes of a crisis exacerbate and prolong the real downturn associated with the crisis. In particular, government policies that affect productivity and hours of work are most often responsible for throttling economic growth.\\n\\nThat this was true in our Great Depression is now clear. While earlier historians focused attention on the failures of monetary policy, and on the distortions caused by the Hawley-Smoot tariffs, evidence now points more strongly to policies that tried to keep wages artificially high (under Hoover and then Roosevelt) and to cartelize industry (under Roosevelt).\\n\\nOK, now here\\'s the \"but\" part: Policies matter. Roosevelt was viewed as a great activist leader during the Depression. In fact, he was a great experimenter, willing to try one thing, then another, to turn the country around. The result was an economic downturn that lasted for many years longer than it might have.\\n\\nFor many decades following the Great Depression, conventional historians viewed the crash as a failure caused by laissez-faire policies, rampant speculation and the incompetence of people like Hoover and Andrew Mellon. They attributed the subsequent recovery to the inspired leadership of Roosevelt and to the role of the government in directing economic activity. We are beginning to hear these rumblings again, along with rhetoric that is hostile to trade, globalization and immigration, not to mention a mounting distrust of markets.\\n\\nThese are easy populist positions to adopt, but they are dangerous and false--even dangerously false--because policies matter. They matter deeply, and once adopted, it is extremely hard for the country to change course. Can the current leadership in Washington right the ship enough to forestall a head-long rush into a catastrophic storm? This writer is optimistic--guardedly--that good sense will prevail. But he is not, as yet, a Micawber.\\n\\nThomas F. Cooley, the Paganelli-Bull professor of economics and Richard R.

       "  'text': 'Methinks the vice president doth exaggerate too much.\\n\\n“I think I can say . . . no president, and I would argue in the 20th century and including now the 21st century, has had as many serious problems which are cases of first-instance laid on his table,” Vice President Joe Biden recently told donors in Wisconsin.\\n\\n“Franklin Roosevelt faced more dire consequences, but in a bizarre way it was more straightforward.”\\n\\nReally? He believes that the issues on President Obama’s desk surpass those of Franklin Roosevelt and others?\\n\\nTwo problems puncture Biden’s balloon.\\n\\nFirst, by using the words “first instance,” he implies that the top domestic issue facing America—the economy—is a first-time problem. While our culture and economy have changed since FDR’s time, the core symptom is the same.\\n\\nUnemployment is the most tangible evidence of poor economic health. During the Great Depression, unemployment sickened the economy, inflating to nearly 25 percent, a quarter of the population. People did anything to survive. Texans, for example, ate armadillos—can you imagine a tougher chew?\\n\\nDuring Obama’s term in office, unemployment swelled to 9.8 percent for three months in 2010. In February 2012, it was 8.3 percent, which isn’t healthy but better than what FDR faced from 15 to 25 percent.\\n\\nMy own family has been significantly affected by unemployment and under employment, so I have felt this economy personally. However, my view of history prohibits me from saying that this is a “first instance.” I have written books on the American Revolution, the Civil War, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I have seen remnants of the Great Depression in my own family.\\n\\nI remember walking into my grandmother’s bathroom when I was a child in the 1980s. Hanging on a rack was one leg or half of a pair of hosiery. When my grandmother got a run in one leg, she cut it off at the brief and then combined the two good legs of two separate pairs to save money. She was a child of the Great Depression, which affected her habits for decades. I know I don’t have it that bad—not yet.\\n\\nThe second problem is Biden’s assertion that Roosevelt’s challenges were more straightforward than Obama’s. I doubt FDR saw his options that way when he took Albert Einstein’s advice and authorized the Manhattan Project to beat the Germans at creating the atomic bomb.\\n\\nLikewise Gerald Ford’s choices were unenviable and complex as he tried to get orphans and Americans out of Saigon when it fell to the North Vietnamese communists in 1975.\\n\\nGeorge Washington faced a dire situation in 1776. Yet he correctly guessed that the Hessians hired by the British would drink too much liquor on Christmas Eve. He crossed the Delaware River and launched a surprise attack, preserving the Continental Army from extinction and desertion.\\n\\nIn contrast President James Madison’s request to call up 15,000 men to defend Washington D.C. in case the British army attacked it in 1814 failed because the federal government lacked the authority to draft soldiers back then. Less than 4,000 volunteers came, and the victorious redcoats burned the White House and the U.S. Capitol. Fortunately for Madison, the people of Baltimore rallied and pushed the British out to sea, allowing our flag to forever fly over “the land of the free and the home of the brave.”\\n\\nDay-to-day decision-making at the presidential level is always complex and rarely straightforward at the time. Hindsight makes history look simple because we know the outcome.\\n\\nIn the moment, leaders can only asses the situation, make strategic, principled or practical choices and hope for the best outcome. In his second inaugural address, FDR bet on optimism by quoting on old poet: \"each age is a dream that is dying, or one that is coming to birth.”\\n\\nWhy did Biden make such a hyped historical comparison? He simply wants to get his guy elected. He used a bit of embellishment to do it. Both sides of the political aisle are guilty of exaggeration.\\n\\nHyperbole has long been part of our culture, especially advertising. The success of AMC’s \"Mad Men\" and the 1960s Madison Ave advertising world is iconic proof. Sometimes when you say something often enough, people will believe it—true or not\\n\\nSometimes when you are too close to the decision-making process, your sense of self-importance also increases. What better way to say your candidate deserves re-election than to hype the importance of the issues on his desk compared to his predecessors? The tactic seems to take flight on the surface. But it may not soar for long.\\n\\nRonald Reagan\\'s speechwriter Peggy Noonan wrote in her book \"On Speaking Well\": “The most moving thing in a speech is always the logic. . . . A good case well argued and well said is inherently moving.”\\n\\nUnfortunately, too much exaggeration without enough logic supporting it punctures the message, leaving the messenger full of hot air.\\n\\nJane Hampton Cook, is the author of \"Stories of Faith and Courage from the Revolutionary War,\" \"What Does the President Look Like?\" She is co-author of \"Stories of Faith and Courage from the War in Iraq and Afghanistan\" and others. She recently spoke about this topic on \"Your World with Neil Cavuto.\"For more, visit her website: www.janecook.com.',\n",

       "  'text': 'NEW YORK – It was decades ago when tens of millions of people in the U.S. experienced mass unemployment and social upheaval as the nation clawed its way out of the Great Depression and rumblings of global war were heard from abroad.\\n\\nNow, intimate details of 132 million people who lived through the 1930s will be disclosed as the U.S. government releases the 1940 census on April 2 to the public for the first time after 72 years of privacy protection lapses.\\n\\nAccess to the records will be free and open to anyone on the Internet — but they will not be immediately name searchable.\\n\\nFor genealogists and family historians, the 1940 census release is the most important disclosure of ancestral secrets in a decade and could shake the branches of many family trees. Scholars expect the records to help draw a more pointillistic portrait of a transformative decade in American life.\\n\\nResearchers might be able to follow the movement of refugees from war-torn Europe in the latter half of the 1930s; sketch out in more detail where 100,000 Japanese Americans interned during World War II were living before they were removed; and more fully trace the decades-long migration of blacks from the rural South to cities.\\n\\nHenry Louis Gates Jr., a Harvard University professor and scholar of black history who has promoted the tracing of family ancestry through popular television shows, said the release of the records will be a \"great contribution to American society.\"\\n\\nGates, whose new PBS series \"Finding Your Roots\" begins March 25, said the \"goldmine\" of 1940 records would add important layers of detail to an existing collection of opened census records dating to 1790.\\n\\n\"It\\'s such a rare gift,\" he said of the public\\'s access to census records, \"especially for people who believe that establishing their family trees is important for understanding their relationship to American democracy, the history of our country, and to a larger sense of themselves.\"\\n\\nMargo Anderson, a census historian, said the release of the records could help answer questions about Japanese-Americans interned in camps after the outbreak of WWII.\\n\\n\"What we\\'ll be able to do now, which we really couldn\\'t do, is to take a look at what the Japanese-American community looked like on the eve of evacuation,\" said Anderson, a professor of history and urban studies at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.\\n\\nMore than 120,000 enumerators surveyed 132 million people for the Sixteenth Decennial Census — 21 million of whom are alive today in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\\n\\nThe survey contained 34 questions directed at all households, plus 16 supplemental questions asked of 5 percent of the population. New questions reflected the government\\'s intent on documenting the turbulent decade, by generating data on homelessness, migration, widespread unemployment, irregular salaries and fertility decline.\\n\\nSome of the most contentious questions focused on personal income and were deemed so sensitive they were placed at the end of the survey. Less than 300,000 people opted to have their income responses sealed.\\n\\nIn part because of the need to overcome a growing reluctance by the American public to answer questionnaires and fears about some new questions, the bureau launched its biggest outreach and promotional campaign up to that time, according to records obtained at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum in Hyde Park, N.Y.\\n\\nIt opened its first Division of Public Affairs to blanket the country with its message, reaching out to over 10,000 publications and recruiting public officials, clergy and business owners to promote it.\\n\\nMovie studios were enlisted to encourage their film stars to participate, including Cesar Romero, who later played the Joker in the Batman television series. A photograph of President Franklin D. Roosevelt taking the census also was used for the campaign.\\n\\nThe bureau also hired the managing editor of \"Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life\" to galvanize support in the black community. However, studies in the 1940s revealed undercounts, including 13 percent of draft-age black men.\\n\\nIn a first for the National Archives and Records Administration, the nation\\'s recordkeeper plans to post the entire census on the Internet — its biggest digitization effort to date.\\n\\nThat might be unsurprising given that increasingly popular online ancestry services make vast amounts of genealogical data available. But for previous decennial census releases, researchers had to trek to NARA branches to crank through microfilm machines.\\n\\nStill, finding a name in the 3.8 million digitized images won\\'t be as easy as a Google search: It could be at least six months after the release before a nationwide name index is created.\\n\\nIn the meantime, researchers will need an address to determine a census enumeration district — a way to carve up the map for surveying — to identify where someone lived and then browse the records.\\n\\nSome experts said enthusiasm for the release could be dampened by the lack of a name index, especially for novices.\\n\\n\"It may very well frustrate the newcomers,\" said Thomas Macentee, an industry analyst helping recruit volunteers for a name indexing effort sponsored in part by the Mormon-run FamilySearch.com. \"It\\'s like showing up on Black Friday. If you really want that TV set, if you really want that census record, you are going to be ready to go and you are going to keep at it no matter what.\"\\n\\nPublicly-traded Ancestry.com, which has over 1.7 million customers, is also working to make the census records searchable by indexing almost all fields and providing proprietary tools to mine the data.\\n\\nJosh Hanna, a senior adviser for the company, said the 1940 census will be the biggest database of its kind. \"It\\'ll be the deepest level of indexing we\\'ve ever done,\" he said.\\n\\nAccess to the index and tools will be available for free through the end of 2013.\\n\\nOther individuals and organizations across the country are also working to ease the use of the records, including the New York Public Library, which is digitizing the full set of New York City\\'s 1940 telephone books to help people locate addresses.\\n\\nGenealogy societies and libraries also have been holding packed workshops to educate their members.\\n\\nIn January, about three dozen people gathered in Manhattan for a meeting of the MetroNY Genealogy & Computers Special Interest Group to discuss the census. They included Michelle Novak, who has spent six years searching for information about her paternal grandfather, but has no street address to help locate him.\\n\\nNovak, 43, said family members recalled him as a heavy drinker who worked long hours for the Pennsylvania Railroad and abandoned his family in the early 1930s.\\n\\nBut the few records she has been able to find include a signature in a railroad pension book. She believes the 1940 census might hold additional answers.\\n\\n\"If I can find one record, anything, it may help,\" she said in an email after the meeting. \"Even if I find him in jail or deceased, at least I will have an answer.\"',\n",

       "  'text': 'Just as the U.S. economy appears improving, four sets of forces could thrust America into an abyss rivaling the Great Depression.\\n\\nFirst, for decades, the Washington has pursued more open global trade and domestic deregulation. These unleashed great potential for innovation and growth; however, China and other nations have abused freer trade through export subsidies and import barriers to boost their economies at the expense of others. And, in some industries, a few players have amassed great monopoly power—notably, large financial houses on Wall Street and Europe now have an iron grip on lending.\\n\\nThe Great Recession was caused by too little demand for what U.S. and European workers make and faulty banking practices. During the years prior to the collapse, China and other Asian mercantilists undervalued their currencies to increase exports but refused to purchase nearly as much as they sold in the United States and Europe. Unemployment in the West should have resulted, but banks kept things going by lending too much to consumers on their homes and credit cards. When mortgages and mortgage-backed securities failed, the system collapsed.\\n\\nSince mid-2009, stronger exports and manufacturing have powered a modest U.S. recovery. However, little has been accomplished to curb Asian mercantilism or the Wall Street casino culture. Now, China is addressing its own housing bubble and bank troubles by again devaluing its currency to further boost exports, and U.S. banks are again busy trading, taking bets but not making loans to small and medium-sized businesses. Next year, more competition from China and the credit shortage will combine to slow U.S. growth and jobs creation.\\n\\nSecond, oil is rising above $100 a barrel again, and higher gas prices will limit consumer spending on other items this winter. Yet, President Obama, to placate his political base, continues to slow, stall or stifle most new petroleum projects.\\n\\nThird, European leaders, to tackle their sovereign debt crisis, are cutting spending and raising taxes, but not dealing with flaws in the Eurozone architecture—most importantly, the absence of EU authority to tax, spend and even things out a bit among richer and poorer regions. The 50 percent haircut imposed on private creditors by the Greek bailout, coupled with heavy bank holdings of government bonds, have caused depositors to flee commercial banks in Mediterranean economies and banks across Europe to withdraw from lending outside their home markets. Over the last six months, the money supply and lending have contracted at an alarming pace in the Mediterranean economies and Ireland, and are hardly adequate elsewhere in Europe.\\n\\nDraconian austerity and tight money did much to turn the 1929 panic into the Great Depression, and very similar conditions are unfolding in Europe today. With an economy almost as large as the United States and China combined, the European recession will depress exports and stress banks in the United States. Alone, conditions in Europe might not cause another U.S. recession, but in concert with China’s renewed mercantilism, banking problems and higher gasoline prices, those could sink America quite nicely.\\n\\nFourth, U.S. unemployment remains stubbornly high and the recovery has failed to pick up steam, in some significant measure, because businesses cannot find qualified workers. Yet, many college graduates remain unemployed or underemployed, because America’s high schools and universities do too little to encourage students to study engineering and other technical disciplines. With all these problems percolating, the President spends nearly all his time campaigning, telling Americans things can’t be improved much more for now and the best they can expect is a $20 a week break on their payroll taxes. And Congress foolishly lets him set the agenda.\\n\\nWithout genuine efforts to redefine the rules of trade with Asia, refocus U.S. banks on the quaint business of making loans to finance business expansion, develop more domestic oil, insulate America from the suicidal instincts of European leaders, and require schools and universities to emphasize skills the economy needs, the U.S. economy will continue its low grade recovery or it will slip into a recession that could last a decade.\\n\\nPeter Morici is a professor at the Smith School of Business, University of Maryland School, and former Chief Economist at the U.S. International Trade Commission.

       "  'date': '2012041419',\n",
       "  'text': 'Move over, Feminist Ryan Gosling — there’s a new Tumblr battling sexism.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, 16 undergraduate students at Duke University launched Who Needs Feminism?, a campaign that encourages feminist and gender egalitarian discussion over social media.\\n\\nThe Tumblr features posters and statements from individuals explaining why feminism is important. Statements range from the personal to the global, including “I need feminism because it’s 2012 and only 3% of Fortune 500 CEOs are women,” and “I need feminism because I want to be respected, regardless of what I’m wearing.”\\n\\nWho Needs Feminism? began as the final project for the students’ seminar course, Women in the Public Sphere, the only guideline of which was to focus on social change.\\n\\n“We discussed this extensively and concluded that there is a disturbingly apathetic sentiment toward feminism, both on campus and on a broader societal scale,” says Amy Fryt, a senior at Duke’s Trinity College of Arts & Sciences. “We aim to challenge existing stereotypes surrounding feminists and assert the importance of feminism today.”\\n\\nAll 16 students on the Who Needs Feminism? team came from a variety of backgrounds, networks and social groups, which enabled them to connect with a large audience. Each student is female, but various male and transgender feminists have submitted to the Tumblr. One poster from a male Duke student reads, “I need feminism because too many people of my gender find sexual assault excusable on our campus.”\\n\\nThe Who Needs Feminism? team originally planned for the project to focus on Duke’s campus, but it quickly spread beyond that.\\n\\n“Students from other schools started reaching out to us to start Who Needs Feminism? campaigns at their own schools,” says Laura Kuhlman, a junior at Duke’s Trinity College of Arts & Sciences. “We’ve gotten posts from Duke alumni saying that they are proud of the university for taking this stance and posts from people who say that this campaign inspires them.”\\n\\nKuhlman says that they identified Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter as the main components of their social media strategy early on. “As college students, these are the platforms we use most frequently and we knew that we’d get an expansive reach. We initially thought Facebook would serve as our main source of promotion, but the Tumblr has really taken off,” she says.\\n\\nSince many users have uploaded and submitted their own photos, Kuhlman says that the Tumblr is a great way to encourage discussion without the moderation that the Facebook page requires.\\n\\nThe Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter accounts all interact to promote the general campaign.

       "  'text': 'By Edmund Conway, Economic Editor Last Updated: 7:42PM GMT 26 Feb 2009\\n\\nIn what will be seen by many as die-cast confirmation that the world economy is plummeting towards an economic and corporate implosion of unprecedented proportions, Moody\\'s said it anticipated a tidal wave of defaults was approaching.\\n\\nIt said that in the coming months more than 15pc of speculative-grade bonds and loans - all but the most highly-rated - would default on their debts.\\n\\nThis peak is even higher than the peak reached in 1933, when bank after bank throughout America was collapsing, taking hoards of other companies with them. Back then, the default rate peaked at 15.4pc; moreover these companies were former investment grade issuers regarded as more reliable credit prospects than their contemporary counterparts.\\n\\nKenneth Emery, senior vice president at Moody\\'s said: \"The three main drivers of the forecasting model are forecasts for the high-yield bond spread and the unemployment rate, along with the current level of issuer ratings. In the fourth quarter, the high yield bond spread reached unprecedented levels; and we\\'ve got an unemployment forecast approaching 9pc this year and issuer ratings at record low levels.\\n\\n\"We certainly think that this credit cycle will be worse than the last two in the early 1990s and 2000s. In fact, in 2009 we expect to see the largest number of defaults since the advent of high yield bond market in the early 1980s. And the default rate for non-investment grade bonds may reach levels even higher than those registered during the Great Depression.\\n\\n\"There are risks here because we are in unchartered territory, but the model forecast is that roughly 15pc of our speculative-grade issuers globally will default in 2009. In Europe the forecast default rate is even higher at close to 19pc.\"\\n\\nThe report traced the health of the bond market all the way back to the 1920s, and finds that the threat of companies defaulting is more stark now than at any point in that stretch of time. It predicted that company defaults will triple this year to about 300, after 101 defaulted last year on more than $280bn of debt.\\n\\nIf the economy deteriorates by even more than expected, the default rate could conceivably mount to around 20pc, Moody\\'s added - meaning around one in five of all non-investment grade issuers default, something which has never happened before. The companies most at risk of default are consumer transport groups, which largely constitute airlines, media companies and car manufacturers.\\n\\nIn Europe, the sectors most at risk of defaulting include those providing durable and non-durable consumer goods and business services.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Unfortunately, this time I suspect he\\'s right. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson\\'s bail-out is far from perfect, but without it the American and British economies face a crunch the likes of which we can hardly imagine. But how much money would you put on the likelihood of the lamest of lame-duck presidents driving the plan into law?\\n\\nNot much, if the chaotic negotiations in the White House on Thursday night are anything to go by. As the $700 billion plan to prevent the world\\'s biggest economy slumping into the worst recession in living memory was thrown off the road by a cabal of conservative Republicans, the administration suffered an apparent nervous breakdown. Having survived the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan and the terrorist attacks in September 2001, it took a financial crisis to bring true chaos to the heart of the free world.\\n\\nIs this the way the modern economy ends? In a scene of Beckettian farce? If the bail-out does collapse, the consequences are hideous. We are in the early stages of one of the worst world slumps in living memory.\\n\\nFinancial crisis: Bradford & Bingley to become latest victim\\n\\nFinancial crisis: Banks\\' careless and reckless behaviour must end, says Gordon Brown\\n\\nThe financial system on which the economy depends has frozen. In the past few weeks, we have seen some of the world\\'s most venerated names in finance collapse. The US government has in effect nationalised Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG. Lehman Brothers is no more; Merrill Lynch has been eaten by Bank of America, and even Goldman Sachs has had to go cap-in-hand to Warren Buffett.\\n\\nBush was half-right: one \"sucker\" did go down. In the late hours of Thursday, America suffered the biggest bank failure in history, as Washington Mutual was shut down by regulators and the remnants sold to JP Morgan.\\n\\nHistory shows that whenever there is a banking crisis, an economic slump, with all that entails - mass redundancies, falling house prices, widespread bankruptcies - invariably follows. The scale of the recession depends on the size of the banking crisis; the past year has brought the biggest systemic financial collapse since the 1930s.\\n\\nWe know this because economists, including Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, have spent decades studying the causes and potential solutions for episodes such as the Great Depression. They may not have discovered a vaccine for financial panics. We make the same mistakes over and over again: borrowing too much, convincing ourselves we have minimised our financial risk, forgetting that money must be paid back and that house prices go down as well as up. But the quality of the cure has improved.\\n\\nThe worst thing to do now would be to impose medieval remedies. Back in the 1930s, the depression was cemented not by the Wall Street Crash of 1929, but by the hard-nosed policies of the US politicians, who allowed so many banks to fail that they set off a domino effect that took almost a decade of thrift to recover from. It was the financial equivalent of leeches and blood-letting.\\n\\nIn Britain, we had a comparatively benign 1930s, with not one major bank collapsing and the economy faring far better than the US. This time is different. Two of our biggest mortgage lenders have already had to be rescued. We are as vulnerable as the US - if not more so. Indeed, most likely we are already in recession, and the economy will continue shrinking until at least the latter stages of next year. Unemployment will rise by almost a million. House prices - already down by a tenth - will fall by the same margin again, probably more. The problem is that the recent lurches in financial markets could make this far worse. In short, unless the Government is prepared for some radical rescue plans, the next decade could quite easily be our very own 1930s.\\n\\nWhich makes it all the more shocking that, so far, the major initiatives announced by the Government and the Bank of England have been tantamount to handing a paracetamol to someone suffering a heart attack. The Bank has pumped billions of liquidity into the market and it injected more cash in yesterday. However, the lesson from the US is that at some point the Government will probably have to spend a significant chunk of taxpayers\\' cash to keep the financial system - and hence the wider economy - afloat.\\n\\nThis may involve a similar plan to Paulson\\'s - a toxic waste dump for poisonous investments - or merely an injection of public money into the financial sector. It will be expensive, and the consequence, in the long run, is higher taxes or spending cuts once the economy has recovered. The Government has at least the luxury of learning some snatched lessons from America, though there is no telling how soon our own lifeboat may need to be launched.\\n\\nIn the meantime, the authorities must get the cost of borrowing down, or watch the housing market tumble to new lows. The Bank of England ought to have cut interest rates some months ago, but, better late than never, it should do so at the next possible opportunity. It is time to stop lecturing the patient; it is time to start applying the cure.',\n",

Feminism is back on the rise, and it’s all thanks to the internet. Social media lets women share their experiences faster and wider than ever, and that is fuelling a new, highly personal mass movement.\\n\\nTake the ultra-successful Everyday Sexism project, which retweets women’s nasty experiences at the hands of sweaty human octopi. It really is grim reading. They’ve got 90,000 followers on Twitter, although their reach goes way further. Here’s a random example: “I had a stranger slide their hand up between my legs while I was ordering drinks at a bar.” If that happened 18 months ago, the victim would suffer alone. Now she can reach an audience equal to Nuts and Zoo magazines’ readerships combined.\\n\\nGiven we’re talking about a mix of social media and radical politics, things are inevitably moving fastest among students. In the last year, feminist societies have popped up at universities everywhere, including Durham, Liverpool and Kings College London. When I was at university four years ago, we published a reprehensible Page 3 feature on our tabloid website called Tab Totty. We had a Cambridge student posing awkwardly on a punt wearing a pink bikini and the kind of Perspex heels that David Cameron wants to make you opt-in to see. It's offline now, sorry. The shoot attracted the wrath of about three angry feminists.\\n\\nIf someone brought out Tab Totty today, they would be abused in lectures, and their inboxes and message feeds would overflow with messages from people they will never meet telling them just how “vile” (the angry adjective du jour) they are. If you upset a feminist now, you better be prepared for abuse from a hundred others.\\n\\nEarlier this year, a campaign where students were photographed holding placards explaining “why I need feminism” was posted endlessly on Facebook. It’s simple, picture-based storytelling, and marketing professionals are already using it as a case study. In a world without Facebook, that idea would live and die in a few radical magazines. Now, it gets shared and imitated round the world.\\n\\nThe fit is obvious – social media is all about sharing your personal experience. And so too is this contemporary brand of feminism. It’s an aggregation of nasty experiences, annoyances and personal justifications. That stuff might be seriously individualistic, but it’s something everyone can get on board with. In fact, it is a method of political symbolism normally better used by the Right: people, stories and faces, that’s the stuff that arouses human emotion, not tiresome theoretical constructions.\\n\\nThe new feminism is hardly the March on Washington, but it is the only political movement – Jihadists aside – using the Internet effectively. Today’s feminists have a formula politicians and marketers crave: how to harness technology and individualism to build a mass movement people actually care about.\\n\\nSo get used to hearing about the patriarchy, because the online surge is going to mean more feminists everywhere: in the workplace, on the TV, perhaps even in your living room.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'An old canard about feminists is that, in addition to being hirsute bra-burners, we want to turn all women into “victims” – and thanks to “Women Against Feminism”, this particular accusation has gained some moderately mainstream traction in recent weeks.\\n\\nBut feminism doesn’t make women victims. Sexism does.\\n\\nThat inconvenient truth hasn’t stopped conservatives and anti-feminists from using this supposed victimization to bash a movement that won women the rights to vote, have credit cards, not be legally raped by their husbands, use birth control and generally be considered people instead of property, among other things.\\n\\nAdmittedly, to those unfamiliar with stereotypes of the women’s movement, the #WomenAgainstFeminism meme may look more like a parody than anything of serious concern. Many of its participants show a baffling level of ignorance about what feminism actually is – signs reading “I don’t need feminism because my boyfriend treats me right” or “I like men looking at me” are cringe-inducing, for instance. And I’m skeptical of how many new “women’s” Twitter accounts suddenly popped up in the days surrounding the meme’s creation.\\n\\nBut all the cringing and skepticism in the world hasn’t stopped the idea of “Women Against Feminism” from being taken seriously by at least some in the media.\\n\\nThe BBC kicked off a conversation about the “movement” by asking, “Has feminism become unnecessary and irrelevant?” The expected conservative hacks have come out, with the National Review Online bashing the “hostile” feminist responses and Rush Limbaugh saying “pictures of these babes” are “really, really great to see”. And Cathy Young wrote at Time about the multiple disavowals of feminism that cited “I am not a victim” and called the characterization of the movement as victimizing a “fair description”.\\n\\nBut denying that women are a victimized class is simply wrong. What else would you call a segment of the population who are systematically discriminated against in school, work and politics? How would you describe a population whose bodies are objectified to the point of dehumanization? Women are harassed, attacked and sexually assaulted with alarming regularity in America and around the world, and now even more of them live in states where, if pregnant, they can be refused medical attention or arrested for refusing C-sections.\\n\\nPeople who are on the shit end of oppression are oppressed. Accurately describing this is not a matter of politics, but of truth.\\n\\nBut because we live in a culture that values independence and strength and negates the agency of victims – wrongly conflating victimhood with weakness instead of directing our opprobrium at those who victimize – the label will automatically have detractors. No one likes to be a victim, let alone conceive of themselves that way (no matter what George Will believes). But when women refuse to admit to ourselves that we’re systematically victimized, we give fuel to those on the political right who claim – despite all evidence to the contrary – that women are doing just fine.\\n\\nActually, the conservative rhetoric of late around rolling back women’s rights is mostly about women’s “independence”: we don’t need coverage for birth control, we choose the pay gap, we’re too strong for legal protections. (Of course this interest in women’s agency disappears when they’re discussing abortion, of which women are supposedly perpetual victims and in need of the most condescending laws on the books.)\\n\\nIf we’re unwilling to accept women’s factual status as victims in society, it makes it that much harder for society to accept those who hurt women as victimizers.\\n\\nThere’s a reason men like ESPN’s now temporarily-suspended Stephen A Smith say that women who are beaten need to “do your part” and avoid “elements of provocation”. As anti-violence educator and filmmaker Byron Hurt explained in Ebony, it’s because “[t]his deflection never fails. Men create excuses for their abusive behavior and deny women’s victimhood.”\\n\\nClearly there are women – for a myriad of reasons – who don’t want to identify as victims or support the idea that women are victimized. Maybe there are even a lucky few who have never experienced discrimination. But as a college professor once told me, the existence of a few women who have lived their lives under an umbrella of privilege does not mean that it’s not raining on the rest of us.\\n\\nNaming what is happening to women – that we are being oppressed, held back, and yes, victimized – is not weakness. It takes strength to tell uncomfortable truths.',\n",

After the First World War he realized the U.S. was in a position to exert an enormous influence on world financial matters, but he had quite a tragic life. He contracted tuberculosis, and this was before antibiotics. They thought the cure was thin, cold air, so he spent months at a time in the mountains of Colorado while trying to manage the world economy. He died in 1928.\\n\\nThe third character was the German, Hjalmar Schacht. He was brilliant, arrogant but completely opportunistic. He was obsessed by the fact that reparations [that Germany had to pay to the Allies after the war] were unfair. He captured the mood of Germany very well. He presided over the economic miracle during the Weimar years, which was built on a lot of borrowed money. In 1930, when it was clear that Germany was going to go through the wringer, he resigned. Many people believe he realized Germany was doomed and that he did not want to be blamed for it.\\n\\nThe final figure was Émile Moreau of the Banque de France. The others were bankers, but he was a civil servant. He was the mayor of his little town for 35 years, and that captures his character \\x97 a rural Frenchman, he could have come out of a novel by Flaubert. Insular, xenophobic, he refused to learn English and believed, somewhat justifiably, that international finance was an Anglo-Saxon conspiracy designed to exclude France.\\n\\nTelling the story through these four central bankers was a way of highlighting the fact that critical policy decisions are made by individuals, not abstract committees. They had choices.\\n\\nReading your book made me feel a lot better about our economy and policymakers today.\\n\\nWell, we\\'re not going to make the same mistakes. We\\'re not going to let the banking system collapse; nor is anyone going to impale their economy on a fixed exchange rate; nor are we going to raise taxes in the middle of the depression. And we do have the IMF keeping international credit moving.\\n\\nThe one big worry is that in the 1920s, the banking system in the U.S. was about $50 billion, which was about 50% of GDP. The banking system and the shadow banking system now are about 150% of GDP. In Britain it\\'s 350% of GDP. The worry is that the financial system has become so large relative to the size of central banks that we\\'ve created something of a Frankenstein. No one really knows whether we can handle a financial system that\\'s 150% or 200% of GDP.\\n\\nYou mean that monetary policy isn\\'t up to the task?\\n\\nI think we now know that monetary policy has lost all traction. We\\'re putting our faith in fiscal policy.\\n\\nWhy do you say lost all traction?\\n\\nBecause interest rates are at zero. We\\'ve injected all this money into the banking system and banks have lost so much capital that their inclination is to hoard capital. It\\'s going to be very hard to get it out the other end. That happened in 1932. By 1932, the Fed finally realized it had to do something, and there was a very large open-market operation \\x97 basically, buying bonds \\x97 and recapitalization of the banking system, and that stopped the run on the banks temporarily, but credit continued to decline.\\n\\nSo what do you make of how our current economic crisis is being handled?\\n\\nI suppose the one thing is, thank God for Larry Summers, in the following sense: when monetary policy has lost all traction, then your only hope is fiscal policy. The danger with fiscal policy is that they\\'d do too little, because we\\'ve spent the last umpteen years saying we\\'ve got to keep our deficit under control. This is not the time to worry about that. Until [Summers] came along, I was struck by how modest all of the stimulus packages everyone was talking about were. He\\'s sort of the [John] Maynard Keynes of today. He says go for it \\x97 let\\'s spend $600, $700 billion a year.\\n\\nTo what extent do you think it\\'s possible to prevent financial collapse \\x97 as opposed to just dealing with it after it arrives? In 1926, the central bankers in your book were already worrying about many of the things that would eventually lead to the Great Depression. They saw it coming but didn\\'t stop it.\\n\\nThe odd thing about the central bankers of the time is that you read their letters to each other, and they really were very worried in a way; I don\\'t think Greenspan was worried enough two years ago. But they had these intellectual blinders on and basically were so rigidly tied to the gold standard that they had almost given up almost all degrees of freedom. They didn\\'t do anything but agonize.\\n\\nAnd I do think it\\'s possible to worry and then figure out what to do. We\\'re learning a whole series of lessons now, like you don\\'t want to create shadow banking systems without enough capital. The idea that we should do nothing about bubbles because of this Greenspan notion that we can never figure out the difference between an asset-price increase that is fundamentally driven vs. one that\\'s a bubble, I think, has been completely discredited. Everyone now says we should act preemptively against bubbles.\\n\\nIf we didn\\'t learn that lesson from the run-up in the stock market before the Depression, is there any reason to believe we\\'ll remember it the next time around?\\n\\nI think we\\'ll remember it for another 30 years and then maybe forget it. [John Kenneth] Galbraith has this fantastic line where he says you basically have these things every generation. But you need the old generation to die off and forget the lessons.\\n\\nI also wonder how much power central bankers ultimately have to prevent massive problems like this. You write about how in 1929, when the Fed cracked down on banks lending to brokers selling stock on margin, money flooded in from other sources.\\n\\nMonetary policy is fine for steering the economy while it\\'s on level ground, but the minute you go into a ditch, monetary policy isn\\'t enough to get us out of it. Variation in interest rates is normally an effective way of steering the economy, but then you get into these crises where the whole machine collapses, and all you\\'re doing is pressing on the accelerator and spinning your wheels.\\n\\nI do think there is a wider issue [of] investing so much power in the hands of people like Alan Greenspan and saying, \\'We\\'ll just trust you because you said it\\'s O.K.\\' \\x97 I don\\'t think anyone is going to do that for another 50 years, until we forget about this mistake. All of the people who were running central banks allowed the financial system to become so large and leverage to become so pervasive. That they allowed banks in Iceland to become 850% of GDP is crazy. The Royal Bank of Scotland had the largest balance sheet in the world for a while. That made no sense.\\n\\nCentral bankers in the 1930s and \\'40s were not important people. Government basically told them what to do. This whole mystique of, Just give it to this élite group of men to run the world economy \\x97 I don\\'t think we\\'re going to allow that to happen again for a while.',\n",

       "  'text': 'By Adam Shell, USA TODAY\\n\\nNEW YORK \\x97 The images of bread lines, dust storms and squatters\\' camps are missing in the aftermath of the worst financial crisis since the\\n\\n. Stocks have rebounded sharply from the 12-year low hit in March 2009 during the Great Recession. The U.S. economy, while still sluggish, is growing again. And fears of financial Armageddon have mostly faded.\\n\\nYet comparisons to the woeful 1930s continue to pop up in Wall Street research reports, newspaper op-ed pieces, doomsday books and the financial blogosphere. There is a nagging sense that the roller coaster ride investors have been on since the 2008-09 financial meltdown may not be over — and that a \\'30s-style boom-bust, boom-bust cycle can\\'t yet be ruled out — as the economy and markets muddle through the difficult post-bubble workout period.\\n\\nThe Dow Jones industrials\\' 261-point plunge Friday sparked by a sharp drop in consumer sentiment in July highlights that gloominess persists.\\n\\nFueling the angst is fear that the still-fragile, jobs-starved economy will suffer a relapse, or double dip, as government stimulus is phased out. Consider:\\n\\n•In a recent note to clients, David Rosenberg, chief strategist at Gluskin Sheff, ticks off a slew of similarities between then and now under the heading, \"Daring to Compare Today to the \\'30s.\"\\n\\n•Donald Luskin, chief investment officer at Trend Macrolytics, penned an op-ed piece, \"Why This Isn\\'t Like 1938 — At Least Not Yet.\"\\n\\n•In late June, Paul Krugman, professor of economics and international affairs at Princeton University and an op-ed columnist for The New York Times, zeroed in on the issue twice under provocative headlines: \"That \\'30s Feeling\" and \"The Third Depression.\"\\n\\nWhy all the hand-wringing over the \\'30s? \"To focus people on risk and remind them that it is way too early to declare victory,\" Luskin says. \"It is prudent to learn from past errors so we don\\'t repeat them.\"\\n\\nStock charts that overlay current stock-price action to that of the 1930s look very much the same at similar stages of the recovery. The difference is 80 years ago the market suffered another major down leg. The future will show if the market suffers a similar fate, or whether it stabilizes and powers higher.\\n\\n\"The similarities are scarily similar,\" says Richard Suttmeier, chief market strategist at ValuEngine.com. \"Essentially, in the \\'30s we were in unchartered waters, and we have been in unchartered waters since 2008.\"\\n\\nBig rallies, then big dips\\n\\nWelcome to the uncertain, post-bubble world. History has shown that when financial bubbles burst the fallout is not resolved overnight.\\n\\nTypically, after once-in-a-generation-type declines, powerful rebounds tend to occur, but the trajectory is never straight up. Relief rallies are often followed by big dips, which are then followed by fresh rallies and sell-offs.\\n\\nNew highs often don\\'t materialize for years, if at all. Ten years after super-pricey tech stocks crashed in 2000, the Nasdaq composite remains 56.8% below its record high. Similarly, Japan\\'s benchmark stock index, the Nikkei 225, is down 75.8% since its stock and real estate bubble burst in late 1989.\\n\\nConsider the aftermath of the 1929 stock market crash. After an initial drop of nearly 48% the Dow enjoyed five bull market rallies, with gains ranging from 23.4% to 48%, says Dow Jones Indexes. But each rebound was followed by a sizable relapse, with declines from 37.4% to 53.6%. Each relapse led to lower lows and the Dow\\'s eventual record bear market decline of 89.2%. The Dow took 25 years to hit a new high.\\n\\nBears say investors today should prepare themselves for similar volatility. They have gotten a dose of big swings already. After the Dow\\'s 53.7% drop in the 2007-09 bear market, it has rallied as much as 71%, only to suffer a recent correction of 13.6%.\\n\\nWorking through the problems caused by the wealth destruction due to the real estate bust, 8.5 million lost jobs and the worst stock decline since the 1930s will take time. The initial economic rebound may prove fleeting, bears argue, which could cause stock prices, which have been rising on the hopes of a sustainable recovery, to head back down if those expectations are not met.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, a spate of economic reports have come in weaker than expected, fueling double-dip fears. In July, readings on manufacturing, retail sales, factory orders, employment, auto and home sales came in light. Last Wednesday, minutes of the Federal Reserve\\'s June meeting indicated it expects growth to slow in the second half, prompting the central bank to lower its 2010 growth outlook to as low as 3%.\\n\\nIn the words of former Fed chief Alan Greenspan, the economy has hit an \"invisible wall.\"\\n\\nThe biggest argument for an economic relapse is the notion that the recovery has been fueled by government stimulus and easy-money policies from the Fed. The fear is that once the government\\'s steroid-like stimulus wears off, the economy won\\'t be able to grow on its own.\\n\\n\"Most of the growth has come from Uncle Sam\\'s generosity,\" Rosenberg says. \"That\\'s what is keeping the economy together. When the central bank and the government pull back on the stimulus, double-dip risks rise.\"\\n\\nThe end of government subsidies resulted in a 33% drop in sales of new homes and autos last month.\\n\\n(If history were to repeat itself and stocks are in the 10th year of a 16-year secular bear market, as Rosenberg believes, the Dow, which closed Friday at 10,097.90, could fall to 5000.)\\n\\nThe lack of job growth, coupled with consumers and homeowners that are riddled with debt, will make it harder for the consumer-driven U.S. economy to grow its way out of its problems, says Rodney Johnson, portfolio manager for the Dent Tactical ETF.\\n\\nThe national unemployment rate stands at 9.5%, or more than 14 million Americans, says the Department of Labor, far below the peak unemployment rate of 25% during the Great Depression. But those numbers don\\'t fully convey the jobs weakness. Another 8.6 million people are working part time because they can\\'t get full-time jobs. And 3.8 million, discouraged by the dearth of job opportunities, are out of work but were not counted as unemployed.\\n\\n\"If you\\'re not making money, it\\'s pretty hard to spend it,\" or pay bills, Johnson says. \"There\\'s no fuel in the economic engine to make it grow. People are spending less and saving more.\"\\n\\nFurther crimping the outlook for future growth is the fact that cash-rich U.S. companies, despite improving profitability, are still leery of the recovery and are reluctant to deploy that money to grow or hire new workers.\\n\\n\"Companies have pared their expenses dramatically, upgraded their technology, improved their profit margins,\" Johnson says. \"But they are not hiring more people, because they would have to see greater demand to do so.\"\\n\\nAnother potential growth killer is what Wall Street perceives as an anti-business, growth-choking stance from the Obama administration. \"Obama is anti-business, and business is anti-Obama; this is the \\'meme du jour,\\' \" economist Edward Yardeni says.\\n\\nMany investors also worry about a \"policy mistake.\" They fear, for example, that when the Fed starts to raise short-term interest rates — which the Fed has hinted is not on the immediate horizon — they might move too aggressively and slow the economy down just when it can least afford to decelerate. Ill-timed deficit reduction policies, such as tax increases, could snarl growth as well.\\n\\n\"The only way to get out of debt is to earn money,\" Luskin says. \"The only way to get out of recession is to grow. If you kill growth, you are\" in trouble.\\n\\nA move toward protectionist trade policies also worries investors, as does Europe\\'s debt troubles, which could also impede the U.S. recovery.\\n\\nOdds are against double dip\\n\\nBut a double dip is not a likely outcome, says James Stack, editor of investment newsletter InvesTech Research. There has been only one such relapse in history. It occurred in the early 1980s.\\n\\n\"The double-dip debate,\" Stack says, \"is one that is very often visited in the first 18 months of a bull market.\" When the economy is in early stages of recovery, investor doubts about the sustainability of the rebound are common, he says. \"But the odds are against a double dip,\" he says.\\n\\nStill, Stack is well aware of the ultra-bearish forecasts circulating. \"Let\\'s face it, fear sells,\" he says.\\n\\nStack does not see evidence that suggests a bad outcome — at least not yet. The stock market tends to fare worse when optimism is sky-high. That is not the case now. A July 7 poll conducted by the American Association of Individual Investors showed bears outnumbering bulls by almost 3-to-1. The 17 times that has occurred since 1988, stocks were up 15 times both three and six months later, InvesTech Research shows. But the most recent AAII poll showed less bears than bulls.\\n\\nWhat\\'s more, Stack has yet to see other warning signs that would indicate that stocks and the economy are poised to roll over — namely a massive plunge in consumer confidence and a stock rally led by just a handful of stocks.\\n\\nBut a red flag was raised Friday. The University of Michigan\\'s index of consumer sentiment in July fell unexpectedly to an 11-month low after its best reading since January 2008 last month. The market is also still getting broad participation from a large number of stocks, a sign of health.\\n\\nAnd while investors are looking at a slower recovery, slow growth, he stresses, does not equate to a double dip.\\n\\n\"Until we see a deterioration in market breadth and leadership, we are giving the bull market the benefit of the doubt,\" says Stack, who currently has 95% of assets invested in stocks.\\n\\nAnother reason to be upbeat about the market\\'s future is the fact that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is a student of the Depression, Luskin says. And that means Bernanke is unlikely to repeat the mistakes made in the 1930s that choked off growth. Bernanke won\\'t likely tighten interest rates too quickly or drain liquidity out of the system too fast, as such moves would jeopardize the recovery. Luskin doesn\\'t see a double dip, nor does he see new highs for stocks anytime soon.\\n\\nAnother big difference between today\\'s market and the 1930s is that stocks went into the current crisis selling at much lower prices relative to their earnings, Luskin adds. Unlike 1929 and 2000, stocks did not crash because they were overpriced. Stocks are now trading below long-term valuations.\\n\\nThe start of the second-quarter earnings season has also given bulls hope, as companies ranging from aluminum maker Alcoa to railroad CSX to computer-chip maker Intel have not only topped analysts\\' expectations but have also had positive things to say about the future. JPMorgan also beat forecasts, but the bank put a damper on things when it provided cautious statements about the economy going forward.\\n\\nSo how should one manage money in an era of unpredictability and volatility?\\n\\nRosenberg advises investors to stay liquid, keep debts low, save more and invest less in risky assets like stocks. He doesn\\'t advise 100% cash. Buy some gold, high-quality bonds and assets that don\\'t go up or down with stocks, he says.\\n\\n\"If you were putting a dime in a cookie jar, maybe stick in 20 cents,\" Rosenberg says. \"If you have the capacity to live a frugal life, do so.\"\\n\\nIn periods of great volatility, where stocks have the potential to post huge gains — and huge losses — it makes sense to put only half the money you would normally devote to stocks in the market, Luskin says. Thus, you will be able to book gains if stocks rally. And you will lose half as much if stocks plunge.\\n\\nYou share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

       "  'text': 'The Farm Security Administration (FSA) was created in 1937 from an earlier agency named the Resettlement Administration, or RA. The RA had been created by a 1935 executive order of President Franklin D. Roosevelt to help struggling farmers and sharecroppers by providing loans, purchasing depleted farmland and resettling destitute families into government-designed communities.\\n\\nRexford G. Tugwell, a former Columbia University economics professor, was chosen by Roosevelt to lead the RA, and Tugwell appointed his former student and friend Roy K. Stryker to head the agency’s historical section. Stryker’s mission was to document the hardships and conditions around the country, particularly across the Midwestern states and into California. In all, Stryker’s team of photographers produced over 175,000 black and white negatives and 1,610 color transparencies, as well as several films.\\n\\nThese photos are just a small sampling of their work.\\n\\nIn a recorded interview with Richard K. Doud, Stryker reflected on the the project, the photographers and some of their more memorable photos of those years. The following excerpts are from: “Oral history interview with Roy Emerson Stryker, 1963-1965, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution.” (For a full transcript of these interviews, follow the link at the end of this page.)\\n\\nStryker: Russell was a chemical engineer. Married an artist, painted some, saw a couple of the artists who used cameras very effectively, decided that was what he wanted to do and it would probably be the place to belong. And he took up the camera and turned it in to be a very remarkable man in photography.\\n\\nPhotographer Russell Lee was hired early on in the project and stayed throughout its duration.\\n\\nStryker on the FSA photographers:\\n\\nThey were communicating. … some of them had art training. … They were trying to tell us, tell the public, make pictures that were genuine, that recognized peculiar situations whether it be a piece of geography or a human being, and recognized the pertinent things in this particular situation. They had taken the time to check certain facts or investigate, to understand why they were at that place, and what they were going to do. From that point on, ten pictures were taken. Of those ten pictures, if you looked at them — we never evaluated them in terms of set values. We looked at them in terms of what did they have to say about this little group of people, this particular village, this particular dust area, or what. … they were intelligent people reporting things that they felt and saw based upon past experience, based upon a good deal of investigation. And above all else, particularly as regards the human side of this, a sincere, passionate love of people, and respect for people.\\n\\nArthur Rothstein was the first photographer Roy Stryker hired at the beginning of the FSA photographic project. He later went on to work for Look magazine. This photo of a dust storm is one of Rothstein’s more famous photos.\\n\\nWalker Evans was a photographer for the Interior Department when he moved over the join the FSA team.\\n\\nStryker on Marion Post: Marion Post … came in late. She’d been doing photography for one of the Philadelphia papers, and she came down, and we needed an extra photographer, put her on. And if you look through the file, you’ll find Marion has particularly a great sense of our land, of our terrain and a feeling of people on the land, probably more than some of the others. A great love of people, a great warmth and understanding of people.\\n\\nStryker on Evans: Walker walks around and all of a sudden sees … the tombstone in the cemetery, the street, the houses. It’s an interesting picture, because you know that he planned it. That’s not “composed” in the sense that that word is so badly used at times, but he hunts till he finds the right viewpoint, the right place to stand. But he’s telling you a sort of social situation.\\n\\nOn Evans’s photos: … he plans them, he walks around, he looks, and all of a sudden — his is a composed job. He takes time.\\n\\nIn the earlier years of the project, Stryker would use a hole punch to mark “Killed” images. These were usually variations of frames that had already been selected.\\n\\nFarm Security Administration photographers (left to right) John Vachon, Arthur Rothstein and Russell Lee with Roy Stryker (right), looking at photographs. Photo by Beaumont Newhall, created / published between 1937 and 1944.\\n\\nStryker on photography: There are great pictures today and they are not great tomorrow. There are great pictures today and they are going to be great pictures right on down through time, not because they’ve been used a lot, but because they were great pictures probably and it took many, many people keep sensing the same thing.\\n\\nAbout half of the images made for this project have survived to the present day.\\n\\nIn 1942, the FSA morphed into the Office of War Information, or OWI, which operated until 1944.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Paul Ryan has set everyone’s socks ablaze with a new comment suggesting he wants to shake down the country again over the debt limit. This inevitably inspired a lot of amateur psychoanalysis attempting to figure out whether he was serious or just pandering to the base. Whether that is true is an important thing to figure out, but the deeper subtext here is that the Republican Party continues to organize itself around the kind of austerity agenda that, should they obtain enough power to implement it, would cause another recession immediately, possibly a very bad one.\\n\\n“We, as a caucus, along with our Senate counterparts, are going to meet and discuss what it is we want to get out of the debt limit,” Mr. Ryan said on Fox News Sunday. “We don’t want ‘nothing’ out of the debt limit. We’re going to decide what it is we can accomplish out of this debt limit fight.”\\n\\nThe first thing that always comes to mind when top Republicans are saying crazy things is that it’s hard to know how serious they are being. As Steve Benen points out, Republicans’ last attempt to hold up the debt ceiling backfired spectacularly. It was a ransom demand so ludicrously irresponsible, so dangerous, such a violent insult to democratic legitimacy that Democrats literally had no choice other than to hold firm against it, across the board. So I suspect Steve is right when he says:\\n\\nYesterday, Ryan raised the specter of yet another crisis, in which Republicans would threaten to hurt Americans on purpose, but here’s the thing: we now know he and his party won’t actually follow through. GOP lawmakers can hold the proverbial gun to the nation’s head, but party leaders have already made it abundantly clear that they’re not prepared to pull the trigger.\\n\\nSo, when it comes to holding the nation’s full faith and credit hostage to get more austerity, Republicans probably don’t have the stones to go through with it. But, as Ed Kilgore never tires of pointing out, this dispute is entirely about tactics, and the agenda they actually do agree on amongst themselves would be a deeply destructive one if they could realize it. Republicans have been so single-minded in pursuit of this agenda that even despite controlling only one half of one branch of government they have managed to impose a level of austerity unseen since the post-WWII demobilization. Currently, Republicans have less purchase on monetary policy, but they have a similarly harsh hard money agenda there too. Paul Ryan, Republican policy king, has proposed that the Federal Reserve should be stripped of its mandate to combat unemployment, that the Fed should increase interest rates, and pegging the dollar to a basket of commodities gold standard-style.\\n\\nAll this basically adds up to Hoover-nomics. When the crash of 1929 gave a sharp shock to aggregate demand, Herbert Hoover went for balanced budgets and did not challenge the gold standard, thus cutting off both avenues for economic stimulus. In short order, unemployment reached 25%. All the electoral incentives in the world couldn’t convince him to change his mind, and he was absolutely crushed in 1932 polls. It took a generation for the GOP to recover its reputation.\\n\\nEven some right-leaning thinkers are warning the GOP that their agenda (especially on monetary policy) could cause just such a crisis. But it is plain as day that the party’s political elites don’t believe them.\\n\\nIn many ways the mild, moderate nature of President Obama’s domestic agenda has been poison for Republicans. Since the base won’t allow any accommodation with anything Obama does, and since his economic policy has been conventional or even center-right, economics itself has been discredited in the GOP (a few reformist writers notwithstanding). Whatever the motivations of Paul Ryan for his latest foray into extremist political tactics, there should be no doubt that Republicans are perfectly sincere in their desire for maximum austerity, no matter what the consequences for the country, and would implement it as savagely as possible if given the chance.\\n\\nGALLERY: The best photos of 2013',\n",

       "  'text': 'Posted by Suzi Parker on February 8, 2013 at 9:01 am\\n\\n“Feminism” is not a dirty word.\\n\\nBut some people think it is. A staffer at Beliefnet, a spirituality, inspiration and emotional wellness Web site, told Minnesota playwright Kristine Holmgren that readers had issues with the word “feminism.”\\n\\nHolmgren, who planned to use in the word in the title of her new blog for the site, shared an email from Beliefnet’s marketing and business analyst Sharon Kirk with media writer Jim Romensko on his Web site.\\n\\n“\\xadI would suggest changing the tag line or deleting all together as I’m concerned about the negative connotation that our readers may associate with the word feminism,” the email read. “In addition, we’ll want this blog to focus more on Christianity/spirituality as opposed to issues related to feminism. What do you think of simply ‘Sweet Truths with Kristine Holmgren’?”\\n\\nHolmgren, who is also a Presbyterian pastor, told Kirk, “Please phone me.” In their ensuing discussion, Holmgren says, she asked whether Kirk was troubled by the word “feminist.” No, Kirk reportedly answered, but the Web site’s readers were. Holgren then told the Web site she didn’t want to write for it.\\n\\nHave conservatives so corrupted the word “feminist” that is now tainted like the word like “liberal” or “environmentalist”? The fact that this is even in the realm of discussion in 2013 makes my head ache terribly — and makes me angry.\\n\\nFeminism, in its simplest definition, means women – and men who align with that philosophy – who want equal rights for women. Who believe women should have equal pay, legal, voting, education and reproductive rights and protection from domestic violence, sexual assault and harassment. And no, you don’t have be a militant and burn your bra to be a feminist. But you can if you want to.\\n\\nWhen I was growing up, my mother, who was of the generation where women married after high school, took their husband’s name and had babies, always told me that I could do anything a boy could do. I sometimes doubted that in the 1970s South, when girls were still dressing in frills to attend cotillion and enter beauty pageants. But I gave it my best shot. I skateboarded, popped wheelies on my bike and played baseball – not softball – with the neighborhood boys. And like the boys, I suffered skinned knees and bruised arms (mine were visible when I wore my sundresses). I felt equal, if not at times better, than they were.\\n\\nSome 20-something, millennial women say that feminism has corrupted their femininity and their wish to stay at home and raise children. Not at all. Feminism is about the opportunity for a woman to choose whatever path in her life she wants, but, also to have the same rights as her male counterparts, whether in the boardroom or the bedroom. If men feel intimidated by this modernity, it’s their problem.\\n\\nThe tainting of the word “feminism” has a lot to do with Rush Limbaugh, who has made it his mission for the last 20 years to try and put women in their proper place. In the early 1990s, he repeatedly used the term “feminazi,” a slur to describe a dozen or so women – Gloria Steinem, Anita Hill and Susan Sarandon – whom he found repulsive for their beliefs. Limbaugh later adopted the term to describe any woman who supported abortion rights or, essentially, who he didn’t like.\\n\\nNot many years ago, the term “queer” was used as anti-gay hate speech. But many millennials have embraced that word, and added “Q” to LGBT to break down boundaries. Popular television shows such as “Queer Eye” and “Queer Folk” have even adopted the term in a positive way.\\n\\nKudos to Holmgren for standing her ground on “feminism.” In the ongoing war on women in this country and around the world, it’s time to take back the word proudly.\\n\\nSuzi Parker is an Arkansas-based political and cultural journalist and author of “Sex in the South: Unbuckling the Bible Belt.” Follow her on Twitter at @SuziParker',\n",

       "  'text': 'In May, 2005, while a governor of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke sat down for an interview with Randall Parker, an economics professor at East Carolina University. Mr. Parker was collecting the thoughts of leading scholars on the Great Depression, including Peter Temin, Christina Romer and Barry Eichengreen. Mr. Parker published the book earlier this year: \\x93The Economics of the Great Depression: A Twenty-First Century Look Back at the Economics of the Interwar Era.\\x94 You can read the full interview with Mr. Bernanke at Mr. Parker’s Web site.\\n\\nParker: Have your views on the importance of debt deflation [in which falling prices make debts more burdensome, causing bankruptcy and choking off lending] as a transmission mechanism changed or been modified at all over the last 22 years?\\n\\nBernanke: I think there is some evidence both from the 1930s and the present that debt deflation can be damaging. We had concerns about deflation risk in the United States as well in recent years and clearly one of the concerns was that falling prices would increase pressure in financial markets. So I think debt deflation is an important channel. I have never thought it was the only channel. But it does have a role to play.\\n\\nParker: Do you see the evils of deflation, whether it was anticipated or unanticipated, as the greatest villain in the story of the Depression? And given the ruinous inflation of the 1970s, is not then price instability, either up or down, one of the greatest sources of economic instability in the last century?\\n\\nBernanke: That\\x92s true Deflation and inflation are destructive perhaps in different ways. For example, deflation has particularly insidious effects on debtors whereas inflation perhaps robs more from creditors but I think the broad conclusion that the policy for a central bank is to maintain medium-term price stability is widely accepted. In many ways this is a return to the gold standard in the sense that they too put the highest value on long-run price stability and thought the gold standard was the way to get there. What they didn\\x92t fully appreciate was the potential for collapse of money supplies in the context of the gold standard that could generate major price instability.\\n\\nParker: Are there any lessons from the Great Depression that need to be relearned?\\n\\nBernanke: First that a central bank\\x92s primary responsibility is the maintenance of price stability The second lesson is that the financial industry is a special industry in terms of its role in macroeconomic stability. Major upheavals in the financial system can be extremely disruptive to the economy as a whole and therefore the central bank and other government institutions have a particular obligation to make sure that financial stability is preserved, that banks and other financial institutions are well capitalized and well managed and that there exists a mechanism for responding in the event of crisis, such as the discount window or a deposit insurance system\\n\\nParker: (Peter) Temin told me that the Fed didn\\x92t think that saving banks was their business back then.\\n\\nBernanke: Well that\\x92s very odd because if you look at the reasons for the Federal Reserve Act in the beginning, one reason was to provide an elastic currency to provide extra money as needed during periods of harvest or planting which in turn was intended to keep short-term interest rates more stable The high short-term interest rates during the fall and the spring created a shortage of liquidity and often provided the backdrop in which banking panics would take place. Classically, October has always been the month for financial problems It was probably more so the case that [the Fed was] concerned either that supporting the banking system was potentially a risk to the maintenance of the gold standard or, probably more importantly, that some purging of the banking system was a necessary prelude to full recovery.\\n\\nRelated article in today’s WSJ: Rate Cut Has Foes on Main Street',\n",

       "  'text': 'The whole of Europe is headed for a permanent recession—a depression. Austerity and labor market reforms can’t save it.\\n\\nRadical measures--abandoning the euro and big deficit spending in Germany--are the only way out. Unemployment exceeds Great Depression levels in Spain, many parts of Greece, Portugal and Italy, and is rising in northern Europe. Slashing government spending and labor market reforms have neither restored Club Med economies nor their governments to solvency. Across much of Europe GDP is shrinking faster than governments can cut spending, and sovereign debt burdens are becoming worse, not better. In the south, labor market reforms can only work if those are decisive enough to change investor’s perceptions and export opportunities abound to sell what new factories could make.\\n\\nEurope’s entitlement culture makes swift reform politically impossible, and the Club Med states’ economic troubles have spread to their natural export markets—the German and other northern economies are contracting too.\\n\\nFor Club Med governments, stimulus won’t work either. They can’t increase borrowing and spending fast enough to boost their economies without panicking bond investors and instigating a pan-European financial crisis.\\n\\nWhat should keep Chancellor Angela Merkel awake at night is if southern Europe completely collapses, Germany and the other northern states, lacking southern markets for their exports, will be thrust into a permanent recession, too— and then all of Europe would be gripped by depression.\\n\\nThen it’s either draconian austerity and double digit unemployment for Germany and other northern states too or investors will desert their bonds too.\\n\\nThe European Central Bank would either have to preside over the demise of the euro or print enough money to finance governments and set off hyper-inflation—Europe would be gripped by double digit inflation and unemployment.\\n\\nWhat technocrats behind Merkel’s extreme austerity prescriptions for southern Europe won’t acknowledge is that a significant measure of German and northern Europe economic success is premised on exporting to the south and amassing trade surpluses.\\n\\nSimple math requires the Mediterranean states to have corresponding trade deficits as long as those are locked inside the euro and can’t devalue their currencies to escape.\\n\\nThose trade deficits must be financed by borrowing from the north—either by their governments spending and borrowing too much, as Rome and Athens did prior to their crises, or their banks finance real estate bubbles, as Madrid permitted prior to the global financial collapse. Once that borrowing is constrained—as the austerity imposed by Germany in exchange for aid now requires—German and other northern economies lose their export markets and sink into recession.\\n\\nThat is happening right now—GDP is contracting in Germany, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria, and Finland. The only option left is for Germany and the others to boost government spending and deficits to stimulate their economies, export less, and import more from the south—permit trade to balance between the north and south and get Europe on a more sustainable path. German politics make voluntarily abandoning mercantilism virtually impossible. Prior to the euro, the European Union thrived without permanent unemployment throughout the Mediterranean states. But now the single currency has locked in high labor costs in the south and made their recessions permanent. A return to national currencies would permit Italy, Spain and the others to devalue to make their exports more attractive in Germany and other northern states and rebalance trade and growth in ways the German politicians can’t or won’t. Europe is slipping into a depression—with unemployment and stagnation reaching levels not seen since the 1930s.\\n\\nNothing can save it other than abandoning extreme austerity, labor market reforms too rapid for national politics to support, and a single currency that delivers economic decay and depravation to large portions of the continent. When high unemployment in Europe brings voters to their senses, then abandoning the euro and realism about the prosperity and security governments can guarantee may bring Europe back.\\n\\nPeter Morici is an economist and professor at the Smith School of Business, University of Maryland, and widely published columnist.

That alone is a problem. But young women have an added burden: they’ve been raised in a society that eschews marriage. They’ve been taught instead to honor sex, singlehood and female empowerment.\\n\\nConsider this statement by Rebecca Traister in Marie Claire: “The world as we’ve known it for a very long time—one in which a woman’s value was tied to her role as a wife—is ending, right in front of us. It is now standard for a woman to spend years on her own, learning, working, earning, socializing, having sex, and yes, having babies in the manner she—and she alone—sees fit. We are living through the invention of independent female adulthood.”\\n\\nThis message is not an anomaly; the idea that women don’t need men or marriage is palpable. It began in earnest more than forty years ago, with the modern feminist movement. Feminists assured women their efforts would result in more satisfying marriages, but the result is something else altogether. It looks something like this:\\n\\n1. Women postpone marriage indefinitely and move in and out of intense romantic relationships, or even live with their boyfriends for years at a time. Eventually, their biological clocks start ticking and many decide they better hurry up and get married to provide a stable home for their yet-to-be-born children. Trouble is, their boyfriend’s not willing to commit.\\n\\n2. Marriage becomes a competitive sport. The complementary nature of marriage—in which two people work together, as equals, toward the same goal but with an appreciation for the qualities each gender brings to the table—has been obliterated. Today, husbands and wives are locked in a battle about whom does more on the home front and how they’re going to get everything done. That’s not a marriage. That’s war.\\n\\nIt’s time to say what no one else will: Feminism didn’t result in equality between the sexes – it resulted in mass confusion. Today, men and women have no idea who’s supposed to do what.\\n\\nPrior to the 1970s, people viewed gender roles as as equally valuable. Many would argue women had the better end of the deal! It’s hard to claim women were oppressed in a nation in which men were expected to stand up when a lady enters the room or to lay down their lives to spare women life. When the Titanic went down in 1912, its sinking took 1,450 lives. Only 103 were women. One-hundred three.\\n\\nCompare that with last year’s wrecked cruise line, the Costa Concordia. It resulted in fewer deaths, but there was another significant difference. “There was no ‘women and children first’ policy. There were big men, crew members, pushing their way past us to get into the lifeboats. It was disgusting,” said passenger Sandra Rogers, 62.\\n\\nThe captain of the ship agrees. In USA Today, Francesco Schettino was asked about his New Year’s resolution. He responded, “Bone up on the parts about ‘women and children first’ and ‘the captain goes down with his ship.’”\\n\\nYou see, the problem with equality is that it implies two things are interchangeable – meaning one thing can be substituted for the other with no ramifications. That is what feminists would have us believe, and anyone who contradicts this dogma is branded sexist.\\n\\nBut the truth must be heard. Being equal in worth, or value, is not the same as being identical, interchangeable beings. Men and women may be capable of doing many of the same things, but that doesn’t mean they want to. That we don’t have more female CEOs or stay-at-home dads proves this in spades.\\n\\nUnless, of course, you’re beholden to feminism. In that case, you’ll believe the above is evidence of discrimination. You’ll believe what feminists taught you to believe: that gender is a social construct.\\n\\nThose of us with children know better. We know little girls love their dolls and boys just want to kick that ball. This doesn’t mean men can’t take care of babies or women can’t play sports. It just means each gender has its own energy that flows in a specific direction. For God’s sake, let it flow.\\n\\nThe battle of the sexes is over. And guess what? No one won. Why not try something else on for size? Like this: men and women are equal, but different. They’ve each been blessed with amazing and unique qualities that they bring to the table. Isn’t it time we stopped fussing about who brought what and simply enjoy the feast?\\n\\nSuzanne Venker has written extensively about politics, parenting, and the influence of feminism on American society.

       "  'text': 'The author of a study claiming the U.S. housing collapse is now worse than during the Great Depression warned Wednesday that the market likely will continue to fall for the rest of the year before going stagnant.\\n\\nPaul Dales, senior U.S. economist for Capital Economics, predicted home prices would fall another 3 percent over the rest of 2011 before potentially hitting bottom.\\n\\n\"Even when that happens, I don\\'t think we\\'re going to see any significant or sustained rises,\" he told FoxNews.com Wednesday, predicting \"a couple years of pretty much no recovery whatsoever.\"\\n\\nThe bleak prediction comes after he released a report estimating that since the collapse began from the pricing peak of 2006, prices have fallen 33 percent -- more than the 31 percent dive recorded between the 1920s and 1930s.\\n\\nThe data underscores the trouble the U.S. economy is having emerging from what is described as the worst recession since the Great Depression. \"The sharp fall in house prices in the first quarter provided further confirmation that this housing crash has been larger and faster than the one during the Great Depression,\" the analysis said.\\n\\nDales said the collapse has eclipsed that of the Great Depression because the boom that preceded it was much bigger. Unlike during the 1920s, access to the housing market was far more open leading up to 2006.\\n\\n\"This boom was characterized by homeownership becoming the norm for pretty much anyone,\" Dales said, noting that the boom has effectively been thrown in reverse.\\n\\nWhile the financial markets have partially bounced back since the 2008 Wall Street collapse and the economy as a whole has been growing, the employment picture is bleak and housing continues to suffer.\\n\\nThe national jobless rate ticked up to 9.1 percent in May -- that was after the Standard & Poor\\'s/Case-Shiller index issued a report showing home prices in a dozen metropolitan regions hit their lowest level in March since the collapse began. Nationally, prices hit a new post-collapse low in the first quarter, and have returned to roughly 2002 levels.\\n\\nDavid Blitzer, chairman of the Index Committee, declared the numbers confirmed a \"double-dip in home prices.\" He and other analysts suggested the U.S. housing market has not yet hit bottom.\\n\\nThe dismal housing market news was compounded Wednesday by the National Association of Home Builders\\' release of its monthly Housing Market Index. The index, which measures builder sentiment on the market, fell to a level of 13 on its 100-point scale. That\\'s three points below the previous month and the lowest level since September 2010. Any reading below 50 indicates negative sentiment about the market.\\n\\nWith fewer homes being built, fewer jobs are available and less revenue is generated for local, state and federal governments. Each new home built creates an average of three jobs for a year and generates about $90,000 in taxes, according to the group.\\n\\nOn the bright side, the NAHB noted that a poll it took of 2,000 2012 voters found that housing is still considered by the largest plurality of homeowners as their biggest investment.\\n\\nAmid the troubling developments in housing, labor and elsewhere, the Obama administration has tried to push several new economic proposals, ranging from new training programs to tax relief.\\n\\nPresident Obama is pleading for patience on the economy while at the same time urging the public to stay positive.\\n\\n\"The sky is not falling,\" the president said during a stop in North Carolina two days ago.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Feminism has never exactly been thought of as a laugh riot, but somehow Wendy Wasserstein managed to locate its funny bone. Not by mocking it -- she was an ardent believer -- but by making the intoxicating, bewildering choices it presented to women a natural ingredient of the human comedy.\\n\\nFrom her earliest efforts, such as \"Uncommon Women and Others,\" to the mid-career triumph of the Pulitzer Prize-winning \"Heidi Chronicles\" to such later, sardonic plays as \"An American Daughter\" and \"Third,\" Wasserstein made her central subjects the question of what women of her generation wanted and the less facile realities of what they got.\\n\\n\"Having it all.\" Ha! In Wasserstein\\'s work, the phrase engendered as much in the way of confusion as freedom.\\n\\nShe charted an up-and-down theatrical career through the changing longitudes and latitudes of her life. It\\'s not surprising that many who admired her writing for the stage felt as if they were forging a personal relationship with her, as her tastefully sunny plays seemed to grow up with them, recounting episodes at college and work and family gatherings and bouts in later middle age with wearying illnesses.\\n\\nAnd now she has died at age 55, five years younger than the great August Wilson, whose passing occurred a scant four months ago. Her death by lymphoma came yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The theater world, knowing for several weeks that she was gravely sick, had been keeping a word-of-mouth vigil for her, and still the news of the demise of such an ebullient chronicler of New York womanhood was a shock. And even sadder because of Lucy, the 6-year-old daughter she leaves behind. Wasserstein had Lucy at age 48 by artificial insemination, and the biological father was a friend whom the unmarried Wasserstein never identified publicly.\\n\\nThe American theater these days is like an appliance in a model line that\\'s no longer being dependably stocked. When a part goes, where do you turn to order the replacement? Wasserstein\\'s plays were not uniformly satisfying. After the Broadway acclaim for \"The Heidi Chronicles\" (1989) and the warmly observed \"Sisters Rosensweig,\" (1993), she was unable to sing as acutely in any other key. But make no mistake: She had established herself as a commercially successful Broadway dramatist in an era when virtually no other woman -- heck, virtually no one at all -- was doing so. Her comedies will justly be remembered as vibrant documents of an urbane baby-boom generation and the more progressive view of women it embraced.\\n\\nShe was sort of the Neil Simon of the ERA. (If you don\\'t know that ERA stands for \"Equal Rights Amendment,\" you are probably too young to have appreciated Wasserstein in her prime.) In fairness, her plays were more topical than Simon\\'s, and although she often could not resist the ba-dum-bum temptations of the slick one-liner, her comedy was both more humane and more calculated to get a rise out of members of her own choir. The comedies are filled with knowing references to highbrow culture and pop, from Wittgenstein to Judy Collins. \"Do you know,\" one of the students observes in \"Uncommon Women and Others\" -- the 1977 play set at her alma mater, Mount Holyoke College -- \"the first time I ever really understood about diaphragms or sex was from reading \\'The Group.\\' \"\\n\\n\"Wendy couldn\\'t help but write a happy ending in everything she wrote because her business was comedy,\" says Ari Roth, artistic director of Theater J. In 2004, his company, ensconced at the D.C. Jewish Community Center, premiered a double bill of Wasserstein playlets, one of which, \"Third,\" later was expanded and then presented last autumn by Lincoln Center Theater. \"She knew how she wanted to end her plays, and so they ended with satisfaction and redemption, even though they could also be bittersweet.\"\\n\\nIn person she could be bubbly, ingratiating, resolutely unglamorous. She had a pudding face, she was rumpled, her hair was often a twisting thicket of unruly curls, and there was a magnetism in her wit and lack of vanity. City-born and -bred, she seemed a quintessential product of New York, always running with the \"in\" theater crowd: Her wide range of pals included such writers as New York Times columnist Frank Rich and such elite drama people as Andre Bishop, artistic director at Lincoln Center Theater, who in stints there and earlier at Playwrights Horizons first presented the bulk of her work.\\n\\nShe wasn\\'t wildly prolific, but \"Heidi\" -- which records the life and times of an art history professor passing through the turbulent, evolutionary late 1960s, \\'70s and \\'80s -- cemented her position as an \"event\" playwright.\\n\\nShe was also a cultural humorist, an observer of the Manhattan folkways of Saks and Zabar\\'s, the Met and the Plaza. Her articles regularly appeared in newspapers and magazines. She wrote about her love of the theater, most memorably in a children\\'s book, \"Pamela\\'s First Musical,\" that\\'s been adapted as, yes, a musical. One of the theater projects she championed was the \"Open Doors\" program administered by the Theater Development Fund, which sent public high school students to a season\\'s worth of plays and musicals, accompanied by professionals in the theater.\\n\\n\"New York playwright liberal\" was the title she conferred on herself, with a degree of wryness, during an interview I conducted with her in March 1997 in Cafe Un Deux Trois, a theater district bistro. At the time, she was preparing for the debut of her most overtly political play, \"An American Daughter,\" inspired by the Zoe Baird incident. Baird was President Bill Clinton\\'s nominee for attorney general who withdrew after it was revealed that she had employed illegal immigrants in her home. Like many of Wasserstein\\'s plays, this one eventually made its way to Washington: \"An American Daughter\" was produced in 2003 at Arena Stage.\\n\\nWasserstein viewed Baird\\'s turmoil as emblematic of the progress women had made and the bias that persisted against those who tried to rise too high in a man\\'s world. Still, the piece lacked the brand of native wisdom, that heightened knowledge of a subject from the inside out, that characterized \"Uncommon Women\" and \"The Heidi Chronicles.\" The play got tepid receptions here and in New York.\\n\\nAlthough her health seemed to decline shortly after the difficult birth of her daughter, Wasserstein returned in her last plays to topics of more intimate concern. \"Welcome to My Rash,\" the playlet paired at Theater J with \"Third,\" took up the question of a woman with facial paralysis and a mysterious rash between her legs. It was a rather sober work, looking at the issue of a middle-aged writer and a brush with mortality.\\n\\nTrue to her nature, Wasserstein wrote an upbeat conclusion. The character undergoes an experimental transfusion and, as Roth put it, \"regains her equilibrium.\"\\n\\n\"That was Wendy,\" he adds. \"Ever the optimist.\"',\n",

       "  'text': 'It’s easy to feel that \\xadglobalization—one of the most vital business trends of the past half-century—is in retreat. Millions of \\xadvoters in the U.S. and Britain blame it for stealing their jobs, and it was a major reason for the international civic convulsion known as Brexit. Political candidates castigate it or abandon trade agreements they previously endorsed. Nobody, it seems, wants to defend globalization right now.\\n\\nFortune’s Global 500 list, which spotlights the public companies with the most revenues on the planet, could be read as confirming an erosion in globalization’s success. The total sales produced by companies on the list fell 11.5%, to $27.6 trillion in 2015, with their profits slumping at essentially the same clip. The chief culprits: a surging dollar, the slowdown in China, and the dramatic collapse of oil prices.\\n\\nIn truth, the picture is considerably more complicated than globalization’s critics would have you believe, and the Global 500 list shows it. Start with resilience—specifically, U.S. resilience. In this summer of overheated political rhetoric, it’s tempting to assume that America is in economic decline. But look at the list and you’ll see that companies based in the U.S. (which represents about 4.4% of the world’s population) make up 27% of the total. Indeed, there were six more American names than there were in 2015, for a total of 134. (China, too, continues to surge. It now has 103; a decade ago, a mere 19 made the cut.)\\n\\nFor more on the Global 500, watch this Fortune video:\\n\\nThis issue illuminates many of the crucial \\xadchallenges relating to globalization, circa 2016. Indeed, Shawn Tully’s “Beware the Almighty Dollar” makes that U.S. resilience look all the more impressive. Tully examines the \\xadconsequences—past and future—that a strong currency is having on American companies. As he explains, it’s a “major drag on the U.S. economy that will get only heavier—especially as it is likely to last for years to come.”\\n\\nFor a sophisticated look at strategies for dealing with the antiglobalization backlash, don’t miss “After Brexit, Global Is Local,” by GE ge CEO Jeff Immelt. Among other things, he lays out an astute approach that will help big companies thrive around the world and make themselves welcome presences. (Hint: The \\xadanswer is spelled j-o-b-s.)\\n\\nYou can find insight on some of the ripple effects of the Chinese slowdown—and equally important, a rare inside journey into one of the most secretive big companies in the world—in Vivienne Walt’s feature on commodities titan Glencore. It is titled “Glencore Digs Out of the Abyss” and shows how precarious 2015 was for the company—the situation was dire enough at its worst moment that executives reached into their own pockets to contribute money to Glencore—along with sketching out CEO Ivan Glasenberg’s plan to restore the company’s luster.\\n\\nGlencore embodies why globalization is now an immutable reality. As Walt puts it, “The commodities that Glencore mines and moves now touch virtually every facet of our hyperwired lives. Charge your cell phone, turn on your computer, flick the light switch, drive your car, ride a train, take a flight, eat a bowl of cereal or a plate of sushi, or drink some sugared coffee—Glencore could have had a hand in all of that.” The company operates all over the globe to make that happen. And so, while voters may want to rebuff a system that they think robs them of jobs, their lives hinge on it—and it’s here to stay.\\n\\nA version of this article appears in the August 1, 2016 issue of Fortune.',\n",

But advocates of globalization never really took into account the possibility that even as nations become interdependent on one another, political difficulties may continue to separate them.\\n\\nGlobalization is a coherent theory for times of comparative peace and economic expansion like the 1990\\'s. It is less persuasive in times of conflict and fear like those we live in today. Although the presidential adviser Karl Rove has insisted that Democrats live in a pre-9/11 world and Republicans do not, the Bush administration\\'s defense of the ports deal seems like a classic case of pre-9/11 thinking. The administration argued that the deal had to go forward if Americans were to remain true to their commitment to open markets and the free movement of investment capital. But add the threat of terrorism and the specter of weapons of mass destruction to the equation, and suddenly the words \"free movement\" seem more like a threat than a harbinger of a more prosperous economic future.\\n\\nBush\\'s deal with India also illustrates the new and unexpected conundrums of globalization. The administration pledged to help India develop nuclear power plants despite that country\\'s refusal to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and its maintenance of an atomic-weapons arsenal. An implicit argument was this: Because India is so important a strategic partner and, prospectively at least, a major economic power, Washington is no longer in a position to insist, even rhetorically, that New Delhi abide by the established rules of the nuclear game.\\n\\nU.S. officials made little effort to deny that they were making an exception in India\\'s case \\x97 an exception they were at pains to point out they would never make for Iran. Rather, as Bush made clear in his joint press conference with the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, the cementing and deepening of the U.S.-Indian alliance were simply too important to allow a mere international legal regime to get in the way. In a world where the economic balance of power is steadily tilting toward Asia, American concerns about runaway arms races are very likely to be overshadowed by American concerns about the need to prevent a destructive competition for scarce fossil-fuel resources with India and China. Better to accept an India that uses more civilian nuclear power (and offers U.S. companies the chance to benefit from the sector\\'s expansion) than to vainly chastise an India that is not going to abandon its nuclear arsenal anyway, whatever the effect on nonproliferation globally.\\n\\nIn retrospect, globalization\\'s most fervent partisans and critics were both naïve to imagine that geopolitics would play second fiddle to geoeconomics. Obviously, the Dubai ports fiasco and the nuclear agreement with India posed very different policy challenges. In the case of Dubai ports, America\\'s traditional role of sponsor and advocate for globalization was politically unsustainable, much to the chagrin of the Bush administration. In the case of the agreement with India, the administration took the view that long-term global stability, including the stability of energy prices, required the abandonment of long-held international legal rules. This is certainly not your grandfather\\'s globalization.\\n\\nThe Achilles heel of that \"inevitabilist\" vision of globalization, so dominant in the 1990\\'s, was its rigid, almost Marxist-like economic determinism. Today\\'s globalization \\x97 inseparable from political concerns, no longer able to overrule nationalist sentiments or national security objections, increasingly marked by the phenomenon of Asian companies buying European and North American assets \\x97 is most likely to be far more controversial and far less orderly.\\n\\nIn all likelihood, Asians will complain about Western hypocrisy. After all, when globalization meant Western companies buying one another and acquiring assets in Asia, the U.S. and the countries of the European Union were unstinting advocates of globalization. Now it may seem that Western nations were never committed to economic interdependence \\x97 globalization in the true sense of the word \\x97 but simply to opening new markets for their own corporations and exporting political and legal norms coined in Washington or Brussels. But could it have been otherwise? As both the Indian nuclear agreement and the furor over the Dubai ports deal demonstrate, imagining that nations could not politicize international trade and economic issues or legal norms is as vain a hope as expecting them to act against their own self-interest in any other sphere of public life. Doubtless, some form of globalization is unavoidable. It will just not be the globalization we had been led to expect.\\n\\nDavid Rieff is a contributing writer for the magazine.',\n",

The benefit to consumers in advanced economies took the form of downward price pressures on these goods. Along the way, however, the middle classes in developed nations failed to see this rising tide lift their boats.\\n\\n\"The biggest losers (other than the very poorest 5 percent), or at least the \\'non-winners,\\' of globalization were those between the 75th and 90th percentiles of the global income distribution whose real income gains were essentially nil,\" according to Milanovic. \"These people, who may be called a global upper-middle class, include many from former Communist countries and Latin America, as well as those citizens of rich countries whose incomes stagnated.\"\\n\\nToby Nangle, co-head of asset allocation at Columbia Threadneedle Asset Management, called this \"globalization as an elephant\" visual, \"the most powerful chart of the last decade.\"\\n\\nThis chart is now making the rounds on Wall Street as strategists search for an economic rationalization of the British referendum vote, the success of U.S. populists, and the rise of separatist movements in Europe, many of which are isolationist in nature.\\n\\n\"We equate the same malaise in the U.K. with that in the U.S. as well as the rest of Europe, reflected in the populist leanings of the electorate,\" writes Deutsche Bank AG\\'s Global Head of Rates Research Dominic Konstam. \"This calls for a radical policy rethink from the established political class and, at this stage, there are limited options but all of them have one thing in common: the need to redistribute spending power from those that have to those that have less.\"\\n\\nThe fact that this narrative has spread to these corners, rather than being confined to the left side of the political spectrum, is itself noteworthy, according to Duncan Weldon, Resolution Group\\'s head of research.\\n\\n\"When people like Deutsche Bank are starting to say, \\'maybe capitalism needs a form of reinvention,\\' maybe that\\'s the time to start listening to that,\" he said during an interview on BloombergTV. \"It\\'s not Bernie Sanders; it\\'s a global investment bank.\"\\n\\nThe easy access to credit prior to the collapse of the U.S. housing market helped paper over the angst stemming from this unequal distribution of income in the western world, Weldon said, but the extent of the problem has been laid bare in the aftermath of the crisis.\\n\\nStrategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch echoed Konstam\\'s words in a note yesterday, calling Brexit a harbinger of a move towards more insular stances by governments in advanced economies — and referenced Milanovic\\'s chart to bolster their case.\\n\\n\"While globalization, immigration and the free market have strong support from the winners of these themes – the plutonomists and the highly educated, in our view they seem to have underestimated the frustration of developed market middle and working classes,\" write Equity Strategists Ajay Singh Kapur and Ritesh Samadhiya. \"We think Brexit could just be the first surprise in a re-calibration of the world away from globalization towards more inward looking policymaking. Away from Wall Street and more towards Main Street. Away from financial asset reflation to more income support and wage inflation.\"\\n\\nConor Sen, portfolio manager at New River Investments, placed the proliferation of this chart (and the associated focus on those who\\'ve lost out from globalization) on a continuum with other narratives that have captured popular attention since the financial crisis.\\n\\nReinhart and Rogoff brought a focus to government debt burdens that lent support to austerity movements; Piketty, meanwhile, suggested that inequality was destined to get worse because the rate of return on capital is higher than economic growth.\\n\\n\"What\\'s now captured the interest of intellectuals is the elephant chart, the idea that over the past 30 years the winners were emerging market middle classes and the 1 percent in developed markets, but the developed markets\\' middle classes were stagnant,\" he wrote. \"And I think we\\'ve finally found the correct framework for thinking about intersection of politics and macroeconomic trends.\"',\n",

       "  'date': '2010030819',\n",
       "  'text': \"A year or so ago an American friend of mine in New York recommended I read a book by Walter Russell Mead called God and Gold. The book is about some of the things Americans and Brits sometimes take for granted about the way the world is. Above all, that the world should be based on open trade, some kind of market economy, state-backed rights to protect property and person.\\n\\nIts argument is that these values are far from universal. In fact they are a specific worldview and value system, rooted in the religion and culture of Dutch Protestantism, which made its way to Britain, and then to the U.S. These values have gone on to power societies that are among the most successful economically that the world has seen.\\n\\nThey have also been the values that have defined the post-war world and what we usually call globalization. Because although globalization is partly driven by changes in telecommunications and transport, it is above all driven by the political commitment to open trade and open markets.\\n\\nMy question is: To what extent is the banking crisis, the credit crisis, a crisis for this kind of globalization? As we start to rebuild global demand after the deepest economic crisis for 60 years, the first economic crisis of the globalized economy, this does seem an important question to ask.\\n\\nThere is no question that the banking crisis has challenged some of the ideological thinking about markets that has defined the last 30 years. The human and irrational dimension of market behavior has reasserted itself.\\n\\nMany market participants left their professional and ethical standards at the door. Regulators and governments failed to appreciate the risks building up in the system. The network of counterparties in the market became both hugely complex and hugely opaque. As we are all taught in economics 101, markets rely on information to work. The credit crunch was, in fact, an information crunch: The market didn't know who had what, or what it was worth.\\n\\nThe banking crisis hasn't undermined the case for markets in general. It is a warning against an ideological belief in their efficiency, and a reminder that they can be distorted by perverse incentives. If the political right have too often made a fetish out of markets and the political left have too often dismissed them as impersonal and dehumanizing, I think the necessary pragmatic line lies somewhere in the middle.\\n\\nThe banking crisis also hasn't undermined the case for open trade. In fact, the openness of the global economy will be critical to the speed and depth of the recovery. The last year has been a stark reminder of the extent to which we are all coupled to the same global demand engine. And that engine will be the mechanism by which restored demand is communicated throughout the global market. We are already starting to see the first signs of this. Very simplistically, the stalling--or rather the deliberate dismantling of that engine by politicians--in the 1930s put a structural check on recovery and helped cause the Great Depression. This time around we seem to have avoided that.\\n\\nTrade was central to the pre-crunch global economy and was indirectly implicated in some of its weaknesses. Above all, the imbalances that built up through the persistent trade surpluses and deficits of some of the world's largest economies worked against the stability of the system as a whole. But the principle of open trade itself was not the problem, and it is a necessary part of the solution.\\n\\nIn that respect it's interesting that the rumblings around the prospects for a world trade deal have been marginally more positive lately--not least here in the U.S. The parameters for this deal have been kicking around since 2008 but have lacked the specific detail and the political will to close the agreement. A substantial package to open up world trade in goods needs the addition of an equivalent package in services, which are a big comparative advantage for the U.S. and the E.U. If we can secure that, the benefits for the global economy would be substantial. Signed in 2010, it would send a powerful signal that governments around the world were grasping the recovery with both hands.\\n\\nWith those two big general defenses of markets and open trade need to come a number of caveats for politics. I've got four. All of these predate the credit crisis, and all of them have been reinforced by the crisis.\\n\\nThe first is that, like the computer programmers always say, garbage in, garbage out. If you can put bad subprime lending derivatives into one end of a global financial market, you can't be surprised when it contaminates all the other parts of the system. The market is a transmission mechanism, and that mechanism is now global.\\n\\nSo the level of government regulation and self-regulation will always be critical to the effectiveness of markets. Because markets reproduce and magnify human behavior. They fail because we are fallible. The market doesn't necessarily get smarter or more effective the freer it gets. We certainly don't want to put financial markets or banks in a regulatory straightjacket. But we need to recognize that there need to be changes to make the system more stable, especially in capital requirements, transparency and the way we trade derivatives.\\n\\nSecond, we have to think about this internationally. Financial markets are global, and the way we manage them has to reflect that. The G20 process has started to do this. We in Europe have moved the design of financial regulation to the E.U. level for the first time, which is a necessary step.\\n\\nPart of the dangerous dynamic of the last three decades has been a tendency of financial jurisdictions to underbid each other in market regulation. We ended up with competition between financial markets rather than competitive financial markets, which is to get things back to front.\\n\\nPresident Obama's proposals on banking regulation came as a bit of a surprise to the people working on the G20 agenda, and it's important that we keep the multilateral process firmly on track. However, I think President Obama's proposals can give that process even greater legitimacy and urgency.\\n\\nThis basic principle of necessary internationalism needs in many ways to be the motif of this century. Climate change, geosecurity, counter terrorism, global economic governance. These all require that we accept the reality of interdependence as the foundation of international public policy.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Peter Mandelson (right), the veteran U.K. minister and old Davos hand, was in New York today delivering a speech at NYU\\'s Stern Business School on a topic much discussed at Davos 2010: what effect has the global financial crisis had on confidence in globalization?\\n\\nHe was staunch in his defense of markets and open trade to rebuild global demand after what he called \"the first economic crisis of the globalized economy.\" But he also pointed out that markets and open trade were a political choice, not universal values, albeit one that had powered \"societies that are among the most successful economically that the world has ever seen.\"\\n\\nHe also had four caveats. First, there was a need for changes to make the financial system more stable, notably via capital requirements, transparency and the way derivatives are traded. Second, global financial markets need global management. Financial jurisdictions had been underbidding each other in market regulation. \"We ended up with competition between financial markets rather than competitive financial markets, which is to get things back to front.\"\\n\\nMandelson extended the need for global management of markets to climate change, geosecurity, counter terrorism and global economic governance. \"The basic principle of necessary internationalism needs in many ways to be the motif of this century.\"\\n\\nHe took a passing swipe at the Obama administration for its unilateral regulatory reforms announced just ahead of the Davos meeting, which, he said, had caught Europe unawares. And he took another one after his speech when he poured cold water on the President\\'s attempt to limit banks’ size and trading activities: “It’s the principle and practice of regulation that you need to focus on, not the size and range of banks,” he told reporters.\\n\\nThird caveat: \"Europe and the U.S. are struggling to come to terms with the end of era of the unquestioned prerogatives of the Atlantic world. But this is the new reality.\" This is not a zero sum game though, Mandelson says. The emerging economies represent \" the largest expansion of [Europe and the U.S.\\'s ] potential markets for both goods and capital in [their] history.\"\\n\\nHis fourth caveat is a call for a social contract for globalization. Knee-jerk protectionism is \"almost always counterproductive,\" he says. But governments have a duty to protect people \"from the single greatest sources of insecurity in life: ill health and unemployment.\"\\n\\nBut Mandelson\\'s social contract \"is not just about protecting short-term losers from change. Government has a critical role to play in building sources of comparative in a society\"--education, science, research and infrastructure. \"And these things,\" he says, \"definitely don\\'t appear out of the air.\"\\n\\n(Mandelson\\'s full speech can be read here.)',\n",

       "  'text': 'The first book by the satirical website Reductress, “How to Win at Feminism: The Definitive Guide to Having It All — And Then Some!”(HarperOne, $22.99 paper) pulls no punches. With chestnuts including “How to Love Your Body Even Though Hers is Better” and “Empowerment Exercise: Embody a Man,” “How to Win at Feminism” unearths — and then skewers — the hidden implications and doublespeak embedded in women’s media, the rebranding of feminism to be “on brand.” The book is funny, provocative, and ultimately on-point.\\n\\nReductress’ merciless irreverence has prompted comparisons to a feminist version of “The Onion.” I spoke to founders and co-authors Beth Newell and Sarah Pappalardo over the phone about satire, mansplaining and more. They’ll be signing “How to Win At Feminism” Friday at Skylight Books in Los Angeles at 7:30 p.m. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\\n\\nSome of the funniest passages in the book come in the form of “Advertorials.” “Lumps Gym” sends up the rhetoric around women’s fitness: at Lumps Gym, “it’s not about changing your body, it’s about changing your whole self.” What was the inspiration?\\n\\nSarah Pappalardo: The inspiration for the advertorials came in part from the ads you find in women’s magazines, especially the kind where the “storytelling” aims to absolve women of their guilt for living in a developed world and with the degree of wealth and privilege. It’s everything from these kind of well-meaning companies that don’t always do very much to actually to change the world, all the way down to the “empowerment marketing” that we see used to sell lotion or tea or chocolate, these “gendered” products. The “Lumps Gym” advertorial is a good example of where we used as much doublespeak as possible. There’s this trend of, “You need to love your body no matter what, but you also need to be healthy, but you also need to love your body,” ad nauseam.\\n\\nBeth Newell: No matter how empowering certain media is it’s still telling us that we need to change something or buy something. It’s always preying on our insecurity, even when it’s in the guise of female empowerment.\\n\\nPieces often begin on the edge of plausibility then escalate to full-blown absurdity. You both come from comedy backgrounds. Can you talk about that sense of escalation in regard to structure?\\n\\nPappalardo: I don’t want to mansplain here, but there’s a term for that and it’s called heightening. Whoops! I just mansplained.\\n\\nLike Reductress, “How to Win at Feminism” feels of-the-moment not just in content, but also in tone, toggling between references to Instagram, Ruth Bader Ginsberg, selfies and bell hooks. Did you have a millennial audience in mind?\\n\\nPappalardo: I think it’s a very millennial book. We do have a few Easter eggs in there for people who may be of the, uh, older persuasion. (They’ve made a lifestyle choice to grow old, but I don’t know why.) We reference a lot of second-wave feminism, things that our mothers dealt with and that we now take for granted. That was a big inspiration for us as well.\\n\\nNewell: One of things that’s exciting for us to cover is the ways that women interact with feminist issues in their daily lives, today, in 2016. A lot of people have a tendency to think that feminist issues have been resolved, and we’re shining a light on what’s still going on out there. What the book and the site are doing is allowing us to laugh at ourselves.\\n\\nDo you consider writing satire a political act?\\n\\nNewell: Satire is a more cathartic, palatable way of getting the news you already get — it doesn’t necessarily change any minds. The only place where I could see satire really affecting change is when it comes to young people who are just entering the political conversation and trying to educate themselves about the forces at play. Otherwise I think it reinforces our perceptions of the world.\\n\\nPappalardo: We’re not necessarily going to change minds, but we do hope to highlight the things that people take for granted in terms of subtle messaging and micro-aggressions aimed towards women. Satire allows us to make a statement through both form and content, as opposed to just saying ‘Hey, this is a problem.’ But if you don’t agree with the same premises that we do when we’re constructing satire, you can read a satirical piece entirely differently than intended.\\n\\nDo you have any concerns that the title, or even the book itself, might be read that way – “differently than intended?”\\n\\nNewell: A man at a book fair told us that we were the reason that Trump was getting elected. We don’t really know what his thought process was.\\n\\nPappalardo: I know! I mean, it was a comedy book fair! Regarding the title, we wanted it clear that the title undermines the genuine goals and tenets and feminism, which is that feminism is for everyone. We wanted to go in direct contrast to that, so that you see the title and think, “Hey, wait a minute, that’s not right.”\\n\\nFrench is a writer in Los Angeles.',\n",

       "  'text': 'In the movie Proof of Life, loosely based on real events and released in 2000, Meg Ryan\\'s character has some harrowing decisions to make. Her husband has been kidnapped in Latin America, and a seemingly crooked local negotiator is handling the ransom bargaining. As events move at a frantic pace, her sister-in-law increasingly becomes uneasy and finally exclaims, \"I want to wait for the guy in Miami!\"\\n\\nRussell Crowe shows up to save the day, so moviegoers never get to meet the man from Miami. He is Emanuel Ackerman, known by his friends as Mike. In real life, he has helped countless businessmen and corporate employees, many insured by Chubb, get out of similar situations--always through negotiations. Proof of Life, which ends with a bullet-riddled rescue, would have been a boring film had Ackerman ever arrived on the scene.\\n\\nInstead, we now have Ackerman\\'s book, the type that, thanks to growing threats to American companies doing business, has increasingly become useful for business professionals. Counterterrorism Strategies for Corporations (Prometheus Books, $18.95) is part memoir and part global survival guide. It also is a warning that in the end, corporations will find themselves on the front lines of the battle with a global jihad.\\n\\nAckerman is very good at playing the wet blanket at the globalization party. A former CIA operative, he seems to relish being a party pooper: He is one of only two people who testified before Congress against George H.W. Bush\\'s nomination to head his beloved CIA. It is fitting that Ackerman starts his book by convincing a room full of executives at an undisclosed U.S. food company that their excitement over growing asparagus in Colombia is misplaced and would likely result not just in financial losses but possibly death.\\n\\nYet Ackerman seems to take little pleasure in his dour realism. He genuinely seems disappointed that his predictions about the impact of Islamic terrorism have been realized. His reverence for Richard Helms, the late CIA director and a mentor, is not only touching but reveals a sincere dedication to service.\\n\\nAckerman is absolutely convinced that Islamic terrorists are increasingly seeking to create economic destruction by turning their attention to corporate targets instead of hitting at Western government and military personnel. He has done the math on this and claims that al-Qaida and its affiliates have conducted 38 major attacks on commercial or economic targets since 9/11 and only 17 on governmental or military targets. He spends a great number of pages expanding on this conceit, meandering through the various networks of the global jihad and the different attacks on global business interests.\\n\\nHis chapter on the interest of Islamic terrorists in targeting business-class hotels seems prescient in light of last weekend\\'s bombing of the Islamabad Marriott in Pakistan, which so far has killed 53, including the Czech ambassador and two Americans. Unfortunately, Ackerman\\'s foresight is a bit undercut by his specific recommendation that he \"would not hesitate to check into the Islamabad Marriott, one of the few facilities in the world that can lay claim to having stopped a suicide bomber in his tracks.\"\\n\\nBut there is no point in holding that assessment against Ackerman. He may have gotten his conclusion on the Islamabad Marriott wrong (like with the World Trade Center, it seems the bad guys had become particularly fixated on this target), but he clearly is focused on the right places and trends.\\n\\nAckerman is at his best when he recounts his own experiences helping people and companies deal with kidnapping and other security issues. How do you negotiate for an abducted Dominican child while convincing a local police chief to not embark on a dangerous rescue attempt? By risking prosecution and putting your own freedom on the line.\\n\\nAckerman also knows not to take himself too seriously. He writes about the kidnappers of a business executive in Bolivia who directed him to place an ad for a lost brown female Doberman. Ackerman took 11 calls from people claiming to have found the Doberman before getting the kidnappers\\' call.\\n\\nThis is not just a book, as the title would suggest, about terrorism, at least as the word is generally defined. Ackerman spends a lot of time concerned with a separate phenomenon he does not fully explain: the globalization of organized crime. Ackerman concedes that the kidnapping and extortion threats he describes are more likely to be committed by a criminal gang than a terrorist cell. The threats posed by cybergangs to corporate Web sites and databases, or the protection rackets formed in Russia and Brazil, indeed seem to be very serious. But those threats have little to do with terrorism.\\n\\nAckerman will also probably never make it in Hollywood. For a book stocked full of anecdotes involving guns and car bombs, it\\'s devoid of much drama. Ackerman writes it more like a report a CIA analyst might file. This is a quality that Ackerman\\'s clients should no doubt appreciate, but I was left yearning for just a little detailed action--or at least a few tears.\\n\\nUltimately, however, Ackerman is both sobering and convincing because he thinks operating in the current global environment is completely doable. His great strength is that he can speak from a position of authority, being that rare creature who has found success both as an intelligence agent and as the operator of an enduring business. He has written a guide for corporate security directors and for those workers who spend a considerable amount of time globetrotting, especially in Muslim countries. Entrepreneurs and executives managing global operations might also benefit from a book that points to corporations thinking about terrorism and security issues in a strategic manner and not just as an afterthought.',\n",

       "  'text': 'SHERYL SANDBERG is not one to settle for being the It Girl of Silicon Valley.\\n\\nNor is the chief operating officer of Facebook willing to write a book that people might merely read.\\n\\nOne of her friends from her Harvard days told Vogue that the brainy, beautiful, charming, stylish, happily married 43-year-old mother of two, one of the world’s richest self-made women, has an “infectious insistence.” (She would have to, having founded Harvard’s aerobics program in the ’80s, wearing blue eye shadow and leg warmers.)\\n\\nNow that she has domesticated the Facebook frat house, Sandberg wants to be “the pompom girl for feminism,” as she calls it. She has a grandiose plan to become the PowerPoint Pied Piper in Prada ankle boots reigniting the women’s revolution — Betty Friedan for the digital age. She wants women to stop limiting and sabotaging themselves.\\n\\nThe petite corporate star is larger than life, and a normal book tour for “Lean In,” which she describes as “sort of a feminist manifesto” mixed with career advice, just won’t do.\\n\\n“I always thought I would run a social movement,” she said in “Makers,” an AOL/PBS documentary on feminist history.\\n\\nSandberg may have caught the fever to change the world from Mark Zuckerberg, or come by it genetically. She writes that her mother, at age 11, responded to a rabbi’s sermon on tikkun olam, the Jewish concept of repairing the world, by “grabbing a tin can and knocking on doors to support civil rights workers in the South.”\\n\\nThe charmed Sandberg is no Queen Bee. Unlike some other women who reach the top, she does not pull up the ladder, or jungle gym, as she prefers to think of it, behind her. Many women found it inspiring when she said in “Makers” that she left work at 5:30 to go home to her kids, even while they acknowledged that you might have to be Sheryl Sandberg to get away with that.\\n\\nSandberg, who worked at the Treasury Department for her mentor, Larry Summers, and at Google before going to Facebook, started a group called the Women of Silicon Valley to listen to celebrity speakers and swap stories.\\n\\nShe knows there is slow evolution or even erosion in women’s progress in some areas, and that many younger women don’t want to be called feminists. Professional women often take their husbands’ last names these days without a thought.\\n\\nHer book is chockablock with good tips and insights, if a bit discouraging at times. She urges women in salary negotiations to smile frequently and use the word “we” instead of “I.” And she encourages employers and women to talk upfront about plans for children, which employers may fear is lawsuit fodder.\\n\\nShe seems to think she can remedy social paradigms with a new kind of club — a combo gabfest, Oprah session and corporate pep talk. (Where’s the yoga?)\\n\\nSandberg has been recruiting corporations to join her Lean In Foundation, which will create the Lean In Community and Lean In Circles, which are, as The Times’s Jodi Kantor wrote, like “consciousness-raising groups of yore.” The circles will entail 8 to 12 peers who will meet monthly and use “education modules” to learn the skills to pursue equality. (Like how Rosa Parks used bus modules.) The debut assignment is a video on how to command more authority by altering how you speak and sit.\\n\\nWomen are encouraged to send in stories about leaning in, but no sad sacks allowed: “Share a positive ending about what you learned from the experience,” says the instructional material for Lean In Circles. And no truants: “Don’t invite flakes.”\\n\\nThat leaves me leaning out.\\n\\nSandberg has already gotten some flak from women who think that her attitude is too elitist and that she is too prone to blame women for failing to get ahead. (Not everyone has Larry Page and Sergey Brin volunteering to baby-sit, and Zuckerberg offering a shoulder to cry on.) Noting that her Facebook page for “Lean In” looks more like an ego wall with “deep thoughts,” critics argue that her unique perch as a mogul with the world’s best husband to boot makes her tone-deaf to the problems average women face as they struggle to make ends meet in a rough economy, while taking care of kids, aging parents and housework.\\n\\nSandberg describes taking her kids to a business conference last year and realizing en route that her daughter had head lice. But the good news was that she was on the private eBay jet.\\n\\nSandberg may mean well, and she may be setting up a run for national office. But she doesn’t understand the difference between a social movement and a social network marketing campaign. Just because digital technology makes connecting possible doesn’t mean you’re actually reaching people.\\n\\nPeople come to a social movement from the bottom up, not the top down. Sandberg has co-opted the vocabulary and romance of a social movement not to sell a cause, but herself.\\n\\nShe says she’s using marketing for the purpose of social idealism. But she’s actually using social idealism for the purpose of marketing.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Reading the variety of reasons that women gave for being opposed to feminism in the much-debated #WomenAgainstFeminism social media campaign is one of the most profoundly depressing experiences I’ve had for a while.\\n\\nThe reason is a fairly basic one. In some ways, it doesn’t much matter whether or not those women choose to define themselves as feminists, or anything else for that matter.\\n\\nThe reality is that at some point in their lives these women – most of them still quite young, to judge by the photos of themselves they post alongside their reasons for rejecting the feminist label – are going to realize that “feminist” issues are not other people’s problems. From birth control to the wage gap to financial savvy, the “feminist” issues are the everyday obstacles that will shape the lives of young women too.\\n\\nThe Women against Feminism campaign is particularly unsettling because it suggests that lessons have been lost. Jane O’Reilly wrote about some of them in her iconic 1971 essay about the radicalization of the American housewife.\\n\\nIt’s a matter of time. Nearly every women is likely to encounter the same kind of “click” moment that Jane O’Reilly so evocatively describes. Perhaps it won’t involve housework.\\n\\nOpen contributions: What do you think?\\n\\nDon’t laugh: stereotypes like these, and not just a lack of women studying math and sciences, mean math, engineering and science programs struggle to recruit women to study fields that will put them on the path to earning higher incomes.\\n\\nA key thing to understand is that feminism is not necessarily about demonizing men as oppressive beings. Men can be feminists too, if they support equality.\\n\\nSince this is the Money page, let’s put the sexual politics – reproductive health, sexual violence and related issues – to one side.\\n\\nLet’s focus squarely on the economic issues, because feminism is an economic issue. Feminism is about recognizing the facts that govern the economic existence of women: we earn less, we save less, we live longer.\\n\\nIt may be nice to wear interesting eyeliner and have nice clothes, but it’s less fun if you have to ask a man or your parents for the money, thus giving them financial power over your look, your life and your decisions.\\n\\nSome things to consider before dismissing feminism: its whole point is to empower you to stand on your own two feet financially. You will need that – even if you don’t think so now.\\n\\nIf you’re a woman, you’re going to make less than you would if you were a man. This is not necessarily because women prefer lower-paying jobs as teachers or nurses to have flexibility. Even if you’re a doctor, it’s likely you’ll earn 71 cents on the dollar compared to your male peers, well below the average of 77 cents. There is even some research suggesting that the gender pay gap for younger women may be widening, in spite of the fact that on average, they are emerging from college better prepared to compete equally with their male counterparts.\\n\\nMaybe it’s semantics. Don’t call yourself a feminist, if the label seems offensive in some way. But you should think like a feminist – which to me means believing that you’re entitled to equal pay for work of equal value, to equal opportunities for employment and advancement, to being viewed as a first-class citizen by both employers and employees.\\n\\nTo the extent that feminists has earned a reputation for not being nice – and heavens, even a bit abrasive – it’s precisely because any time you’re part of a group that is operating at an economic disadvantage, and you start speaking up about it and trying to change things, playing nice simply doesn’t work.\\n\\nWhen Emily Davison threw herself under the hooves of George V’s horse at Epsom Derby in 1913, it wasn’t because dying for the cause of a women’s right to vote her first strategic choice. It was the outcome of years of increasingly active attempts to change an inequitable power structure. Revolutions don’t start quietly, and change is usually hard-won through relentless effort.\\n\\nIn North America and Europe today, we’re in a position of tremendous luxury. Many of us will never be told, outright, that we can’t or shouldn’t do something simply because we’re women. That’s common in other cultures, so we feel protected in the west. I trace my own willingness to call myself a feminist to the moment at my Japanese graduate school where a professor told me that I was not allowed to speak in the seminar class he taught, because I was a woman; the university’s authorities had no problem with this stance. Click.\\n\\nOur relative privilege doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t be aware of the ways in which our gender affects our economic wellbeing. In my next column, I’ll discuss some practical ways to avoid having that happen – whatever label you choose to wear.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Elaine Showalter is professor emerita of English and humanities at Princeton University. She is writing a biography of Julia Ward Howe.\\n\\n‘I am not a postfeminism feminist. I am the Third Wave,” Yale senior Rebecca Walker proclaimed in January 1992, calling on her generation via Ms. magazine to claim its place in feminist history and to reanimate a women’s movement that seemed dated, if not defunct.\\n\\nThe daughter of novelist Alice Walker and the goddaughter of Gloria Steinem, Rebecca Walker had grown up with a feminism as normal and invisible as fluoride in the water; but even those contemporaries who lacked her exceptional opportunities had lived their entire lives in a culture shaped by the women’s movement, and had come of age with contraception and legal abortion. They took feminism for granted or dismissed it as irrelevant.\\n\\nBut that attitude changed, Walker wrote, when young women became outraged by the spectacle of Anita Hill testifying on sexual harassment before 14 skeptical white male members of the Senate Judiciary Committee during the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings. Now, she declared, they needed to wake up, “turn that outrage into political power” and continue the fight.\\n\\nBy naming her feminist generation the Third Wave, Walker followed the standard historical description of periods of American feminism as “waves,” intense surges of political activism followed by tranquil decades of consolidation, backlash or retreat. The first wave was the suffrage movement, culminating in the ratification of the 19th Amendment on Aug. 18, 1920. Fifty years later, in the second wave, American women came together to fight for equal rights to education, employment, housing and protection under the law.\\n\\n“Feminism Unfinished,” however, argues that the “wave” metaphor obscures the history of a continuous American women’s movement sustained by labor activists, civil rights advocates and \\xadsocial-reform campaigners, who may have looked placid on the surface but were paddling like hell underneath. Each of the three authors contributes a chapter to their history of American feminism, and they declare together in their prologue that “there was no period in the last century in which women were not campaigning for greater equality and freedom.” They hope that uncovering the “multiple and unfinished feminisms of the twentieth century can inspire” the women’s movements of the 21st. That’s the surprise signaled in the teasing subtitle.\\n\\nYet the book’s position on the potential for another American women’s movement is more cautious and qualified than the title suggests. The real surprise is that the authors believe that the United States “no longer serves as a world leader when it comes to gender equality” and that the future of feminism may be global rather than American.\\n\\nIn her chapter on “Feminism After Suffrage,” Dorothy Sue Cobble, a professor of history and labor studies at Rutgers, explores the history of American women in the labor movement and civil rights organizations in the decades after the 19th Amendment. She calls the working-class, minority and leftist women in these campaigns “social justice feminists,” who saw economic fairness as the most important key to an egalitarian society. Ironically, the greatest achievement for women during this period was the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, after Rep. Howard Smith, a Virginia conservative, laughingly proposed adding “sex” to the regulations forbidding discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion or national origin. Social-justice feminists opposed Smith’s “Sex Amendment,” which they saw as a strategy to delay, dilute or destroy the bill. And in 1966, when NOW (the National Organization for Women) was founded by Pauli Murray and Betty Friedan as an “NAACP for women,” many social-justice feminists resisted an alliance overtly based on women’s rights. A “feminism” that dared not speak its name was hardly a women’s movement.\\n\\nIn her chapter on “The Women’s Liberation Moment,” Linda Gordon, a professor of history and humanities at New York University, gives long-overdue credit to NOW for its stability, discipline and longevity. She also explains the importance of consciousness-raising in the 1970s. Many women were unaware of their limited opportunities or secondary roles as political problems. Small, leaderless groups, in which women came together to talk about their lives, led them to realize that “the personal was political,” that their intimate and private experiences in the family, school, workplace, sexuality, marriage and divorce were shared by millions of other women. These epiphanies were then channeled into political organization, coalitions and effective action. The women’s liberation movement also educated further generations through women’s studies programs, books, manifestos and magazines.\\n\\nIn 1973, two major Supreme Court decisions — one that banned sex-segregated employment ads, and the famous Roe v. Wade, making abortion legal — had an immediate and lasting impact on women’s lives. Gordon is the only contributor who relates feminism to her own career: “All three of us college professors writing this book, like all professional women and college students, benefited directly from feminism and the affirmative action programs pushed by the movement.”\\n\\nIn the most instructive and challenging chapter, “From a Mindset to a Movement,” Astrid Henry, a professor of women’s studies at Grinnell, traces the development of American feminism since the 1990s. Twenty-first-century feminism is multiracial and multicultural; it links to LGBT groups and protests the global issues of sexual oppression and violence against women. At the same time, it enjoys and endorses new images of women in pop culture, and plays with fashion, make-up and personal style as self-expression. “Unlike my first- and second-wave predecessors,” one fashionista explains, “no one force-fed me femininity. . . . I had to fight for it tooth and nail.” These women rely on e-mail, blogs and Twitter to attract followers and build community awareness. “We began our activism online,” another notes. “Blogs are our consciousness-raising groups.” Some contemporary feminists are concerned with the major American failure to implement family-friendly policies such as state-subsidized child care and paid parental leaves. As the Washington writer Ann Crittenden has pointed out, “This is the big unfinished business of the women’s movement.”\\n\\nBut Henry also admits that “the most defining feature of this generation of feminists is its inability to be defined by any single political goal, ideological perspective, or way of being feminist.” Hashtag feminism “runs the risk of being merely an identity to claim without any political content.” Perhaps, Henry suggests, the diversity and flexibility of “a million little grass-roots movements” are stronger than “one singular vision for social change.” She points to demonstrations, foundations and fundraising as examples of 21st-century feminist activism. Still, she acknowledges concerns that “feminism as a concept is now so watered-down as to be meaningless.”\\n\\nI share that concern. In my view, a mass movement requires a clear goal, compelling enough to unite people across the dividing lines of race, class, age, religion, sexual orientation and ethnicity, and to persuade them to work collectively to achieve it. The goal must be concrete and attainable, even if its ideological underpinnings are complex or contradictory. A movement also requires charismatic leaders to galvanize its adherents into effective action.\\n\\nBut what goal unites American women now? Which leaders inspire us? As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg recently said, women’s autonomy and dignity in the United States are being undermined and eroded just when gay rights are getting overdue attention and respect. Feminism unfinished, American women’s movement finished, would be a sad epitaph to a glorious history.\\n\\nElaine Showalter is professor emerita of English and humanities at Princeton University.

       "  'text': 'In the great tropical harbor of Manila Bay, two groups of men warily approach each other, their hands poised above their weapons. Cold-eyed, globe-trotting traders, they are from opposite ends of the earth: Spain and China.\\n\\nThe Spaniards have a big cache of silver, mined in the Americas by Indian and African slaves; the Chinese bring a selection of fine silk and porcelain, materials created by advanced processes unknown in Europe. It is the summer of 1571, and this swap of silk for silver—the beginning of an exchange in Manila that would last for almost 250 years—marks the opening salvo in what we now call globalization. It was the first time that Europe, Asia and the Americas were bound together in a single economic network.\\n\\nA growing number of scholars believe that the ecological transformation set off by Columbus\\'s voyages was one of the establishing events of the modern world.\\n\\n12 WEEKS: Time it took for the potato blight to spread from Flanders to Ireland in 1845\\n\\n1829: Peak year of the slave trade\\n\\n54,000: Tons of silver shipped from the Americas to Europe in the 1700s, up from 17,000 tons in the 1500s\\n\\n1518: The year an \\'infinite number of ants\\' drove residents from the city of Santo Domingo in Hispaniola\\n\\n$1.4 BILLION: Value of Italy\\'s 2008 crop of tomatoes, a plant native to South America\\n\\n36,000%: Increase in tobacco exports from the Chesapeake colonies from 1640 to 1700\\n\\n0: Earthworms in North America before 1492\\n\\nThe silk would cause a sensation in Spain, as the silver would in China. But the crowds that greeted the returning ships had no idea what they were truly carrying. We usually describe globalization in purely economic terms, but it is also a biological phenomenon. Researchers increasingly think that the most important cargo on these early transoceanic voyages was not silk and silver but an unruly menagerie of plants and animals, many of them accidental stowaways. In the sweep of history, it is this biological side of globalization that may well have the greater impact on the fate of the world\\'s people and nations.\\n\\nSome 250 million years ago, the Earth contained a single landmass known as Pangaea. Geological forces broke up this vast expanse, forever splitting Eurasia and the Americas. Over time the two halves of Pangaea developed wildly different suites of plants and animals.\\n\\nBefore Columbus sailed the Atlantic, only a few venturesome land creatures, mostly insects and birds, had crossed the oceans and established themselves. Otherwise, the world was sliced into separate ecological domains. Columbus\\'s signal accomplishment was, in the phrase of the historian Alfred W. Crosby, to reknit the seams of Pangaea.\\n\\nAfter 1492, the world\\'s ecosystems collided and mixed as European vessels carried thousands of species to new homes across the oceans. The Columbian Exchange, as Mr. Crosby called it, is why we came to have tomatoes in Italy, oranges in Florida, chocolate in Switzerland and chili peppers in Thailand.\\n\\nA growing number of scholars believe that the ecological transformation set off by Columbus\\'s voyages was one of the establishing events of the modern world. Why did Europe rise to predominance? Why did China, once the richest, most advanced society on earth, fall to its knees? Why did chattel slavery take hold in the Americas? Why was it the United Kingdom that launched the Industrial Revolution? All of these questions are tied in crucial ways to the Columbian Exchange.\\n\\nWhere to start? Perhaps with the worms. Earthworms, to be precise—especially the common nightcrawler and the red marsh worm, creatures that did not exist in North America before 1492.\\n\\nWell before the start of the silk-and-silver trade across the Pacific, Spanish and Portuguese conquistadors were sailing the Atlantic in search of precious metals. Ultimately, they exported huge supplies of gold and silver from Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, vastly increasing Europe\\'s money supply. But those homebound ships contained something else of equal importance: the Amazonian plant known today as tobacco.\\n\\nIntoxicating and addictive, tobacco became the subject of the first truly global commodity craze. By 1607, when England founded its first colony in Virginia, London already had more than 7,000 tobacco \"houses\"—cafe-like places where the city\\'s growing throng of nicotine junkies could buy and smoke tobacco. To feed the demand, English ships tied up to Virginia docks and took in barrels of rolled-up tobacco leaves. Typically 4 feet tall and 2½ feet across, each barrel weighed half a ton or more. Sailors balanced out the weight by leaving behind their ships\\' ballast: stones, gravel and soil. They swapped English dirt for Virginia tobacco.\\n\\nThat dirt very likely contained the common nightcrawler and the red marsh worm. So, almost certainly, did the rootballs of plants that the colonists imported. Before Europeans arrived, the upper Midwest, New England and all of Canada had no earthworms—they had been wiped out in the last Ice Age.\\n\\nIn worm-free woodlands, leaves pile up in drifts on the forest floor. Trees and shrubs in wormless places depend on litter for food. When earthworms arrive, they quickly consume the leaf litter, packing the nutrients deep in the soil in the form of castings (worm excrement). Suddenly, the plants can no longer feed themselves; their fine, surface-level root systems are in the wrong place. Wild sarsaparilla, wild oats, Solomon\\'s seal and a host of understory plants die off; grass-like species such as Pennsylvania sedge take over. Sugar maples almost stop growing, and ash seedlings start to thrive.\\n\\nSpread today by farmers, gardeners and anglers, earthworms are obsessive underground engineers, and they are now remaking swathes of Minnesota, Alberta and Ontario. Nobody knows what will happen next in what ecologists see as a gigantic, unplanned, centuries-long experiment.\\n\\nBefore Columbus, the parasites that cause malaria were rampant in Eurasia and Africa but unknown in the Americas. Transported in the bodies of sailors, malaria may have crossed the ocean as early as Columbus\\'s second voyage. Yellow fever, malaria\\'s frequent companion, soon followed.\\n\\nBy the 17th century, the zone where these diseases held sway—coastal areas roughly from Washington, D.C., to the Brazil-Ecuador border—was dangerous territory for European migrants, many of whom died within months of arrival. By contrast, most West Africans had built-in defenses, acquired or genetic, against the diseases.\\n\\nInitially, American planters preferred to pay to import European laborers—they spoke the same language and knew European farming methods. They also cost less than slaves bought from Africa, but they were far less hardy and thus a riskier investment. In purely economic terms, the historian Philip Curtin has calculated, the diseases of the Columbian Exchange made the enslaved worker \"preferable at anything up to three times the price of the European.\"\\n\\nDid the Columbian Exchange cause chattel slavery in the Americas? No. People are moral agents who weigh many considerations. But anyone who knows how markets work will understand the pull exerted by slavery\\'s superior profitability.\\n\\nMuch more direct was the role of the Columbian Exchange in the creation of Great Britain. In 1698, a visionary huckster named William Paterson persuaded wealthy Scots to invest as much as half the nation\\'s available capital in a scheme to colonize Panama, hoping to control the chokepoint for trade between the Pacific and the Atlantic. As the historian J.R. McNeill recounted in \"Mosquito Empires,\" malaria and yellow fever quickly slew almost 90% of the 2,500 colonists. The debacle caused a financial meltdown.\\n\\nAt the time, England and Scotland shared a monarch but remained separate nations. England, the bigger partner, had been pushing a complete merger for decades. Scots had resisted, fearing a London-dominated economy, but now England promised to reimburse investors in the failed Panama project as part of a union agreement. As Mr. McNeill wrote, \"Thus Great Britain was born, with assistance from the fevers of Panama.\"\\n\\nBut Scots could hardly complain about the consequences of the Columbian Exchange. By the time they were absorbed into Britain, their daily bread, so to speak, was a South American tuber now familiar as the domestic potato.\\n\\nCompared with grains, tubers are inherently more productive. If the head of a wheat or rice plant grows too big, the plant will fall over, killing it. There are no structural worries with tubers, which grow underground. Eighteenth-century farmers who planted potatoes reaped about four times as much dry food matter as they did from wheat or barley.\\n\\nHunger was then a familiar presence in Europe. France had 40 nationwide food calamities between 1500 and 1800, more than one every decade, according to the French historian Fernand Braudel. England had still more. The continent simply could not sustain itself.\\n\\nThe potato allowed most of Europe—a 2,000-mile band between Ireland and the Ukraine—to feed itself. (Corn, another American crop, played a similar role in Italy and Romania.) Political stability, higher incomes and a population boom were the result. Imported from Peru, the potato became the fuel for the rise of Europe.\\n\\nThe sweet potato played a similar role in China. Introduced (along with corn) from South America via the Pacific silver trade in the 1590s, it suddenly provided a way for Chinese farmers to cultivate upland areas that had been unusable for rice paddies. The nutritious new crop encouraged the fertility boom of the Qing dynasty, but the experiment soon went badly wrong.\\n\\nBecause Chinese farmers had never cultivated their dry uplands, they made beginners\\' mistakes. An increase in erosion led to extraordinary levels of flooding, which in turn fed popular unrest and destabilized the government. The new crops that had helped to strengthen Europe were a key factor in weakening China.\\n\\nAmerican forests are being devastated by foreign pests—and forests full of dead trees are prone to catastrophic fires. A fire in Washington State, above.\\n\\nThe Columbian Exchange carried other costs as well. When Spanish colonists in Hispaniola imported African plantains in 1516, the Harvard entomologist Edward O. Wilson has proposed, they also brought over some of the plant\\'s parasites: scale insects, which suck the juices from banana roots.\\n\\nIn Hispaniola, Mr. Wilson argues, these insects had no natural enemies. Their numbers must have exploded—a phenomenon known as \"ecological release.\" The spread of scale insects would have delighted one of the region\\'s native species: the tropical fire ant, which is fond of dining on the sugary excrement of scale insects. A big increase in scale insects would have led to a big increase in fire ants.\\n\\nThis is only informed speculation. What happened in 1518 and 1519 is not. According to an account by a priest who witnessed those years, Spanish homes and plantations in Hispaniola were invaded by \"an infinite number of ants,\" their stings causing \"greater pains than wasps that bite and hurt men.\" Overwhelmed by the onslaught, Spaniards abandoned their homes to the insects, depopulating Santo Domingo. It was the first modern eco-catastrophe.\\n\\nA second, much more consequential disaster occurred two centuries later, when European ships accidentally imported the fungus-like organism, native to Peru, that causes the potato disease known as late blight. First appearing in Flanders in June 1845, it was carried by winds to potato farms around Paris in August. Weeks later it wiped out fields in the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark and England. Blight appeared in Ireland on Sept. 13.\\n\\nThe Irish were more dependent on potatoes than any other Western nation. Within two years, more than a million died. Millions more fled. The nation never regained its footing. Today Ireland has the melancholy distinction of being the only nation in Europe, and perhaps the world, to have fewer people within the same boundaries than it did more than 150 years ago.\\n\\nThe Columbian Exchange continues to this day. The Pará rubber tree, originally from Brazil, now occupies huge swathes of southeast Asia, providing the latex necessary to make the tires, belts, O-rings and gaskets that invisibly maintain industrial civilization. (Synthetic rubber of equal quality still cannot be practicably manufactured.)\\n\\nAsian rubber plantations owe their existence to a British swashbuckler named Henry Wickham, who in 1876 smuggled 70,000 rubber seeds from Brazil to London\\'s Kew Gardens. Rubber-tree plantations are next to impossible in the tree\\'s Amazonian home, because they are wiped out by an aggressive native fungus, Microcyclus ulei. Much as the potato blight crossed the Atlantic, M. ulei will surely make its way across the Pacific one day, with consequences as disastrous as they are predictable.\\n\\nSpecies have always moved around, taking advantage of happenstance or favorable circumstances. But the Columbian Exchange, like a biological Internet, has put every part of the natural world in contact with every other, refashioning it, for better or worse, at a staggering rate.\\n\\nIn Southeast Asia, rubber trees now occupy huge swathes of land; plantations are nearly impossible in the tree\\'s Amazonian home because of a native fungus. A rubber tapper extracts latex in Brazil, above.\\n\\nThe consequences are as hard to predict as those of globalization itself. Even as plantations of Brazilian rubber take over tropical forests in Southeast Asia, plantations of soybeans, a Chinese legume, are replacing almost 80,000 square miles of the southern Amazon, an area almost the size of Britain. In dry northeastern Brazil, Australian eucalyptus covers more than 15,000 square miles. Returning the favor, entrepreneurs in Australia are now attempting to establish plantations of açaí, a Brazilian palm tree whose fruit has been endorsed by celebrities as being super-healthful.\\n\\nAll of these developments will yield positive economic results—soy exports, for instance, are making Brazil into an agricultural powerhouse, lifting the fortunes of countless poor farmers in remote places. But the downside of the ongoing Columbian Exchange is equally stark. Forests in the U.S. are being devastated by a host of foreign pests, including sudden oak death, a cousin of potato blight that is probably from southern China; the emerald ash borer, an insect from northern China that probably arrived in ship pallets; and white pine blister rust, a native of Siberia first seen in the Pacific Northwest in 1920.\\n\\nForests full of dead trees are prone to catastrophic fires, a convulsive agent of change. New species will rush in to replace those that are lost, with effects that cannot be known in advance. We will simply have to wait to see what kind of landscape our children will inherit.\\n\\nToday our news is dominated by stories of debt deals and novel computer applications and strife in the Middle East. But centuries from now, historians may well see our own era as we have started to see the rise of the modern West: as yet another chapter in the unfolding tumult of the Columbian Exchange.\\n\\nCorrections & Amplifications The emerald ash borer probably arrived in the U.S. in ship pallets from China. An earlier version of this article misspelled pallets as palettes.',\n",

       "  'text': 'THE O.J. Simpson trial is one reflection of how domestic violence haunts American society. Is \"Gone With the Wind\" another? Specifically, did Rhett Butler rape or, less offensively, ravish Scarlett O\\'Hara?\\n\\nThe debate began a few years back in academic journals and the lecture hall between two feminist philosophers -- one of them Christina Hoff Sommers, who has since outraged many feminists with her book \"Who Stole Feminism? How Women Betrayed Women,\" published last year. The argument in her book -- that feminism is dominated by those who seek to persuade the public that American women \"are not the free creatures we think we are\" -- is foreshadowed in the dispute over Margaret Mitchell\\'s Civil War saga.\\n\\nIn case you missed it, the debate has resurfaced again. Here are excerpts. TOM KUNTZ\\n\\nFrom a speech given last fall to the American Enterprise Institute by Ms. Sommers, an associate professor of philosophy at Clark University in Worcester, Mass., and reprinted in the current issue of The American Enterprise:\\n\\nUntil 1989, I was an academic feminist in good standing. My essays were included in female anthologies. I was invited to feminist conferences. My courses were cross-listed with Women\\'s Studies. I ran afoul of the feminist establishment when I published an essay in the Chronicle of Higher Education that said something politically incorrect about the famous staircase scene in \"Gone With the Wind.\"\\n\\n\"Many women,\" I wrote, \"continue to enjoy the sight of Rhett Butler carrying Scarlett O\\'Hara up the stairs in a fate undreamt of in feminist philosophy.\"\\n\\nI meant that to be both lighthearted and a serious warning that feminist theorists were out of touch with women. However, my remark incensed [ members of ] the Society for Women in Philosophy. . . . [ At a meeting of the society ] the feminist philosopher Marilyn Friedman would read a paper showing once and for all how my views were treasonable to women.\\n\\nThe paper by Ms. Friedman, associate professor of philosophy at Washington University in St. Louis, appeared in the Journal of Social Philosophy (Fall/Winter 1990):\\n\\nSommers\\' remark that Scarlett O\\'Hara\\'s rape by Rhett Butler is a fate undreamt of in feminist philosophy is . . . simply stunning. (Note that Sommers does not use the word \"rape\" here -- one of many omissions in her writings.) Even a passing knowledge of feminist philosophy reveals that rape is hardly undreamt of in it. Rape, of course, is not a dream; it is a nightmare. Any form of sexual aggression can involve coercion, intimidation, degradation, physical abuse, battering, and, in extreme cases, death.\\n\\nThe reality of rape is rendered invisible by the many novels and films, such as \"Gone With the Wind,\" which romanticize and mystify it. They portray the rapist as a handsome man whose domination is pleasurable in bed, and portray women as happy to have their own sexual choices and refusals crushed by such men.\\n\\nIn a culture in which these sorts of betrayals are routine, it is no surprise that this scene arouses the sexual desire of some men. The name of Richard Speck, to take one example, can remind us that all rape is not the pleasurable fantasy intimated in \"Gone With the Wind.\" To put the point graphically: would \"many women\" still swoon over Butler\\'s rape of O\\'Hara if they knew he urinated on her? When you\\'re the victim of a rape, you don\\'t have much choice over what goes on.\\n\\nTo which Ms. Sommers responded in a speech at the same gathering, and reprinted in the same journal:\\n\\nAt the time I made the remark, I was unacquainted with a book that has since come into my hands called \"Scarlett\\'s Women: \\'Gone With the Wind\\' and its Female Fans.\" The feminist author, Helen Taylor, actually did a survey of women who read \"Gone With the Wind\" or saw the movie asking them what they thought happened between Rhett and Scarlett . . .:\\n\\n\" [ T ] he majority of my correspondents (and I agree) recognize the ambiguous nature of the encounter and interpret it as a scene of mutually pleasurable rough sex . . . By far the majority of the women who responded to me saw the episode as erotically exciting, emotionally stirring and profoundly memorable. Few of them referred to it as \"rape.\\' \" . . .\\n\\nSome of you might find Friedman\\'s perverse insistence on rape simply stunning. Well I too find it perverse but I am not stunned. I read quite a lot of what the gender feminists write. And I have learned that they almost always interpret a text in a way that puts the most humiliating construction on women\\'s experiences with men. The gender feminist \"subtext\" of almost everything written about men and women in the patriarchy is rape, prostitution, debasement. . . .\\n\\nRebutting Ms. Sommers\\'s rebuttal of her rebuttal, Ms. Friedman wrote an article for the same issue of the journal:\\n\\nConsider the crucial scene. . . . From the moment of Rhett Butler\\'s first appearance in the novel, his physical power is emphasized: his large size, powerful build and excessive muscularity. . . . O\\'Hara and Butler eventually marry, but their relationship is far from blissful. . . . [ Butler warns ] : \"I\\'m riding you with a slack rein, my pet, but don\\'t forget that I\\'m riding with curb and spur just the same.\" When O\\'Hara expresses her desire to have no more children, [ clearly implying ] that she wishes no further sexual relations, they quarrel. Says O\\'Hara, \"I shall lock my door every night.\" Responded Butler, \"Why bother? If I wanted you, no lock would keep me out.\" This sounds to me like a verbal threat of rape. Is it merely my own \"humiliating construction\" to see it so?\\n\\nThe controversial sexual encounter develops after a drinking bout in which Butler becomes progressively more violent and intimidating. . . .\\n\\n\" \\'Observe my hands, my dear,\\' he said, flexing them. . . . \\'I could tear you to pieces with them with no trouble whatsoever and I would do it if it would take Ashley out of your mind. But it wouldn\\'t. So I think I\\'ll remove him from your mind forever this way. I\\'ll put my hands, so, on each side of your head and I\\'ll smash your skull between them like a walnut and that will blot him out.\\' \" . . .\\n\\n\"He swung her off her feet into his arms and started up the stairs. Her head was crushed against his chest. . . . He hurt her and she cried out. . . . Up the stairs, he went in the utter darkness, up, up, and she was wild with fear. . . . He stopped suddenly on the landing and, turning her swiftly in his arms, bent over her and kissed her with a savagery and a completeness that wiped out everything from her mind but the dark into which she was sinking and the lips on hers.\" . . .\\n\\nBy the time Butler gets to genital penetration, O\\'Hara is sexually aroused. Whether or not that makes her a willing participant is a further debatable point. Since it is debatable (although I would argue for the negative), [ the ] narrow notion of rape does not apply automatically. However, I use the term \"rape\" in a wider sense, in which it refers to any very intimate sexual contact which is initiated forcibly or against the will of the recipient. Perhaps . . . we should refer to this wider notion as \"sexual domination.\" . . .\\n\\nYes, O\\'Hara becomes aroused by the encounter. That is precisely what some feminist theorists have objected to: she becomes aroused by being sexually dominated. . . .\\n\\nIn her own words of recollection the next morning, as written by Margaret Mitchell, O\\'Hara has been \"humbled,\" \"hurt,\" and \"used . . . brutally.\" O\\'Hara, it seems to me, has a more credible understanding of her own experience than does Sommers. . . .\\n\\nNot to be outdone, Ms. Sommers responded in the journal the following spring:\\n\\nIn her second go at me Friedman has changed her tune about what did take place. She no longer compares Rhett Butler to Richard Speck and she acknowledges that the \"narrow notion\" of \"rape\" may not apply. . . . Thus Friedman insists that even when \"no\" turns to \"yes,\" a rape has occurred. . . . She now finds herself in the position of conceding to the macho male the sexist thesis that women like the idea of being raped (in the \"wider sense\").\\n\\nPhoto: Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh in \"Gone With the Wind.\" (MGM)',\n",

       "  'text': \"Globalization will mean different things to different players within that spectrum. Major research universities, to compete, have got to think about finding the best talent; they need to find international partnerships. You have some interesting things going on with Yale, a big leader in globalization, doing partnerships with Chinese universities.\\n\\nThe Chinese have great facilities and cheap facilities and lab space and very highly trained technicians, and Yale can bring in top professors who can manage research projects. That's really a win-win situation; each side uses its comparative advantage. Ultimately as the Chinese universities improve and China develops more top research [expertise] itself that will shift the balance. For now it's a win-win.\\n\\nThere are many universities that are simply trying to get involved in exchanges. They are bringing in students from other parts of the world, [sometimes] for long-term [degree] programs; they are sending their students overseas. There is a real awareness that it is helpful to be exposed to students with different cultures.\\n\\nIt's a marketplace in education and people have to think carefully about what their mission is and whether globalization is going to be an important part of that mission.\\n\\nWhat does all this mean for students in terms of competition to gain access to these now newly global institutions? What is the point of view from the students' perspective rather than from the universities', countries' and employers' perspective?\\n\\nJust as there is a wide variety of universities, there is a wide variety of students. Some students are never going to travel overseas. But travel is cheaper than ever before. Communications are easier than ever before. I think universities are more interested in enrolling the best student they can find than ever before.\\n\\nSometimes they are interested in revenue from these students. Great Britain and Australia have a lot of overseas students who pay full freight; they pay a lot of tuition, so they are attractive financially--but I think their brainpower is [also] attractive to other countries. Students have a lot of opportunities because of the global marketplace.\\n\\nA woman I interviewed from South Africa already had an undergraduate degree in chemistry and wanted to get a graduate degree. She looked at global college rankings to get a sense of what the best programs were. She applied to a bunch of them and she got a fellowship for a Ph.D. in chemistry at the University of Warwick in England.\\n\\nI think of a guy I spoke to in India. The IITs are fiercely competitive. He came in No. 22 in the country on the [national] exam, which is extraordinary. He went to an IIT, and while he was there he won a place as a research assistant in this place at a leading research institute in Switzerland. Then he landed an internship at UBS in Hong Kong, and after he graduated he worked for two years at UBS in Hong Kong and was transferred to London, where he is now.\\n\\nFor all the latest headlines visit Forbes Asia.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Ben Wildavsky believes there is a global marketplace for higher education. A senior fellow at the Kauffman Foundation, Wildavsky traveled to far-flung college campuses to research his new book, The Great Brain Race: How Global Universities Are Reshaping The World. In it he describes myriad initiatives by schools from Yale to Saudi Arabia\\'s brand-new King Abdullah University of Science and Technology. These universities vie for top-notch talent, no matter what country a student\\'s passport may bear. Schools open up satellite campuses, collaborate on research and academic paper publication, and try to lure big-name professors. All this is partly for tuition revenue and partly for prestige (and to climb up global college rankings).\\n\\nAs more students hunger for degrees, the field of for-profit and online education is ballooning. As Wildavsky sees it, competition among universities is good, resulting in institutions that better serve students\\' needs and equip them to gain a foothold in an increasingly cutthroat workforce. He talked to Forbes about the characteristics of this new \"global university,\" who stands to benefit and the international future of higher education. Below are excerpts from the conversation.\\n\\nForbes: What defines a global university, and how do you measure it?\\n\\nWildavsky: The brain race is defined by the unprecedented movement of students around the world, and the growing movement of faculty around the world, and the creation of efforts by countries like South Korea and Saudi Arabia to create world-class universities that really can compete with the best that is out there. One can define it in a number of ways: from receiving students from overseas to sending students overseas, engaging in international research and the doubling of cross-border scientific collaboration in the last 20 years.\\n\\nAnd how do you measure it? Well the most prominent way of measuring it is through global college rankings, and I describe this in my book as a natural extension of a creation of marketplace. Just like financial markets, educational markets need information in order to function effectively. So the bottom line is that as this marketplace is developing, these rankings are being to help students, to help universities themselves, to help policymakers and governments to gauge exactly how effective these universities are. The rankings, of course, have many imperfections; they are a work in progress. [Shanghai Jiao Tong University does one ranking of the best colleges on the planet.]\\n\\nWhat were the most striking and innovative schools or programs that you visited over the course of your research?\\n\\nI spent some time at several branch campuses in the Middle East. Those are fascinating places. You can go to a place called Education City in Qatar, outside of the city [Doha]. It\\'s a very small campus facility, lavishly funded and created by [the Qatari government, with branches] Georgetown University\\'s School of Foreign Service, Northwestern University\\'s Medill School of Journalism, Weill Cornell Medical College, Texas A&M [and other colleges].\\n\\nYou see these giant buildings made of marble with massive doorways. It looks like some kind of ancient temple, and young women come out of these doorways dressed in the traditional [head and body] covering, and they are engineering students at Texas A & M. There are signs all around saying, \"Welcome Home, Aggie\" [referring to the university\\'s students and sports teams]. This is an effort to bring the Texas A&M culture to the Middle East. And that is just the tip of the iceberg. You see all kinds of cultural juxtapositions at branch campuses.\\n\\nI am intrigued by these universities trying to go where their customers are. That is what the branch campus phenomenon is all about. In some places the branch campuses in the Middle East typically are invited by their government; in other places it is more of a market-based venture, trying to earn some revenues.\\n\\nI think that the whole concept that John Sexton has, as the president of NYU [which is opening a new liberal arts campus in Abu Dhabi], to create [what he calls] \"virtual network universities,\" is very striking. He wants to move away from the idea of a central home campus with a few places where people go to study abroad. You might start a course in Shanghai and finish out in Abu Dhabi, or start out in Washington Square and finish up in Shanghai--the idea is that there is no center.\\n\\nFor all the latest headlines visit Forbes Asia.',\n",

       "  'text': 'On April 4, 1991, Mary Joe Frug, a prominent feminist legal scholar at the New England School of Law in Boston, was hacked to death on the streets of Cambridge. Wielding a military-style knife with a 7-inch-long blade, her assailant, as yet unknown, stabbed her four times.\\n\\nOn April 4, 1992, the Harvard Law Review held its annual gala banquet, when the torch of the nation\\'s most prestigious legal journal is passed to a new generation of editors. Among those invited: the murdered woman\\'s husband, Gerald Frug, a member of the Harvard Law School faculty. Had he attended, he would have found on his plate a parody of his wife\\'s last article. The parody, titled \"He-Manifesto of Post-Mortem Legal Feminism,\" was produced by the Law Review\\'s editors and paid for by the school. It depicted Ms. Frug as a humorless, sex-starved mediocrity and dubbed her the \"Rigor-Mortis Professor of Law.\"\\n\\nThe alleged satire poses a question that is certain to outlast all the finger-pointing, ducking, blaming, petitioning and posturing that has overtaken Cambridge in the nearly two weeks since the \"joke\" came to light: how can Harvard\\'s best and brightest, the men and women who will soon write the opinions of some of the nation\\'s most powerful judges, also be its cruelest and crudest?\\n\\nEarlier this year, Ms. Frug\\'s article, \"A Postmodern Feminist Legal Manifesto (An Unfinished Draft),\" appeared posthumously in the Harvard Law Review. Several conservative editors fought unsuccessfully to block the piece, a bluntly worded examination of how, Ms. Frug maintained, the law perpetuated the subjugation of women.\\n\\nAs the banquet approached, the Law Review\\'s editors, their coveted, career-making judicial clerkships in hand, turned their efforts to the Harvard Law Revue, an annual send-up of the publication. Along with others who had opposed publication of the Frug article, Craig Coben and Kenneth Fenyo set about to lampoon it.\\n\\nThe result was a five-page, footnote-laden parody, saturated with inside jokes and sexual innuendoes. The article was purportedly dictated \"from beyond the grave\" by one Mary Doe, described as the \"Rigor-Mortis Professor of Law, New England School of Law, 1981-1991\" and \"wife of Gerald Frug, Professor of Law, Harvard Law School.\" In it, Ms. Doe recounts childhood sexual fantasies about men in tight swim trunks, defended the use of obscenities in her scholarly work, and reflected on \"the irony that I, a postmodern feminist, am being published because of my husband\\'s tenure here.\"\\n\\n\"Postmodern feminists represent a diverse group of people,\" the parody continued. \"Some of us are intellectuals. Many are politically committed. Most are disillusioned. Others are just plain horny. But there is one thing that we have in common: we have no sense of humor.\"\\n\\nAs the article began to circulate over the next few days, the adjectives flew. Andrea Brenneke, a third-year law student and one of many women to speak out, called the parody \"a perpetuation of the forces that killed Mary Joe Frug.\" In an open letter, nearly every member of the Harvard law faculty called it \"contemptible and cruel.\" As usual, Laurence H. Tribe and Alan Dershowitz weighed in with their observations. More criticism came -- to his many critics, belatedly and begrudgingly -- from Dean Robert C. Clark.\\n\\nThen came the apologies. The eight editors who oversaw the Revue called the takeoff \"tasteless\" and \"offensive.\" This group included David Ellen, the Review\\'s outgoing president, and Paul Clement, who will clerk one year hence for Justice Antonin Scalia at the United States Supreme Court. The two women among them filed a concurring mea culpa. Mr. Coben and Mr. Fenyo abjectly apologized as well, though they noted that none of their colleagues ever objected to what they wrote, at least until the whole school came down on them.\\n\\nMr. Coben, Mr. Fenyo and Mr. Ellen did not return a reporter\\'s phone calls. But in the fecund tradition of Harvard analyzing Harvard, others offered ample explanations for the debacle: the moral vacuousness of legal education; the sexist zeitgeist; the fractious political climate at Harvard; jangled gender politics in the era of Clarence Thomas, William Kennedy Smith and Mike Tyson; the peculiar combination of intelligence and isolation, sophistication and uncouthness, ignorance and arrogance that characterizes a few students at a few elite law schools.\\n\\nParticularly those students with clerkships in hand. Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg of the United States Court of Appeals in Washington, for whom Mr. Coben will work next year, did not return a phone call. But Mr. Fenyo\\'s future mentor, Judge J. Clifford Wallace of the Court of Appeals in San Diego, seemed disinclined to reconsider his offer in light of the parody. \"I haven\\'t seen it,\" he said. \"I haven\\'t heard anything about it. I\\'m really not even interested in it.\"',\n",

Wielding a military-style knife with a 7-inch-long blade, her assailant, as yet unknown, stabbed her four times.    On April 4, 1992, the Harvard Law Review held its annual gala banquet, when the torch of the nation\\'s most prestigious legal journal is passed to a new generation of editors. Among those invited: the murdered woman\\'s husband, Gerald Frug, a member of the Harvard Law School faculty. Had he attended, he would have found on his plate a parody of his wife\\'s last article. The parody, titled \"He-Manifesto of Post-Mortem Legal Feminism,\" was produced by the Law Review\\'s editors and paid for by the school. It depicted Ms. Frug as a humorless, sex-starved mediocrity and dubbed her the \"Rigor-Mortis Professor of Law.\"',\n",

       "  'text': 'Many foreign stocks offer the prospect of strong growth, but come wrapped in the risk of the unknown. So it’s probably wise for American investors to limit foreign holdings to about 10% of their portfolio.\\n\\n“Don’t chase past performance, and don’t over allocate in a hot category like emerging markets or small caps that have had an extremely strong run over the last five years,” says Gareth Lyons, a fund analyst with Morningstar in Chicago. “Don’t expect the next few years to be a repeat of the immediate past. Take a long-term horizon when investing in international stocks.”\\n\\nClick here for seven things to consider before investing in foreign stocks.\\n\\nPerhaps the safest bet on economic growth overseas, for Americans, is to invest in U.S. companies with a significant foreign presence. Notable examples include Microsoft , Intel , Coca-Cola , General Electric , Wal-Mart and McDonald’s . Such companies receive top-notch analyst coverage at home, and their financial filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission are all available through services such as Edgar.\\n\\nThose who want to own a piece of a foreign company might consider American Depositary Receipts. ADRs are certificates representing a specified number of shares of a foreign company held in trust by a bank. ADRs are convenient for U.S. investors, because these shares trade on a U.S. exchange in dollars, and can usually be bought and sold for the same commission fees as stocks headquartered in the U.S. The bank converts any dividends to dollars, handles withholding and other paperwork. In some cases, an ADR represents a multiple or fractional number of the local foreign stock. The Toyota Motor ADR, for example, is equivalent to two shares of Toyota stock traded in Tokyo.\\n\\nOther notable foreign blue chips available as ADRs include Honda Motor , Sony , Nokia and Intercontinental Hotels Group . ADRs also include up-and-comers such as Virgin Express Holdings and Ryanair –two airlines radically changing air travel in Europe.\\n\\nMany foreign companies have tapped U.S. equity markets and increased their visibility in the U.S. by launching initial public offerings with ADRs. Examples include Telefonica Moviles , a provider of wireless telecommunications services in Spain; and Asat Holdings , a semiconductor manufacturer in China. For more information on ADRs go to ADR.com, a Web site run by JPMorgan Chase . In addition, Forbes Best of the Web has identified ten excellent Web sites where you can go for a lot more information on ADRs and other aspects of foreign investing.\\n\\nDiversification is a key element in any successful portfolio. But that’s a challenge for individual investors, because money, time and logistics limit the number of foreign stocks that can be researched, bought and traded. One easy way around these obstacles is to invest in a mutual fund that concentrates on foreign stocks. We’ve identified a group of such funds–Forbes Best Buys–that offer an excellent balance of risk-adjusted returns and low costs.\\n\\nExchange Traded Funds are also a good way to own a piece of a foreign company. ETFs represent a basket of stocks in an industry sector or market index. Each can be bought and sold as a single security. ETFs are flexible, tax-efficient and low cost. Just about anything you can do with a stock such as Exxon Mobil can be done with an ETF.\\n\\nThe first ETF was launched on the Amex in 1993, and today the bulk of these issues are listed on the Amex. As of May 31, there were 165 ETFs valued at a total of $244 billion and another 34 in registration with the SEC. In contrast, traditional mutual funds hold $8 trillion in assets.\\n\\nThe BLDRS Europe 100 ADR Index Fund tracks the performance of a basket of 100 European-based companies in a range of industries, including banking, electronic equipment, leisure goods, media, oil and gas producers, software and computer services and tobacco. The expense ratio is 30 cents per $100 in assets.\\n\\nThe fund’s top ten holdings are BP , HSBC Holdings , Vodafone , GlaxoSmithKline , Total , Novartis , Royal Dutch Petroleum , UBS , Telefonica and Shell Transport and Trading .\\n\\nThe BLDRS Asia 50 ADR Index Fund tracks 50 leading Asian companies. The fund’s top ten holdings are Toyota, Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group, Honda, Canon , BHP Billiton , Matsushita Electric , Sony, National Australia Bank , NTT Docomo and Taiwan Semiconductor .\\n\\nThe BLDRS Developed Markets 100 ADR Index Fund tracks 100 big companies in Europe and Asia. The BLDRS Emerging Markets 50 ADR Index Fund encompasses companies in 11 nations, including Brazil, China, Indonesia, Russia and Taiwan.\\n\\nIn the years ahead, a number of foreign economies may grow faster than the U.S., which means that the right investments overseas could deliver handsome returns. Just remember that whether you invest in locally traded shares, ADRs or a mutual fund, there are additional risks in foreign investment, including currency fluctuations and political instability. Invest with caution.\\n\\nClick here for seven things to consider before investing in foreign stocks.\\n\\nComments are turned off for this post.',\n",

       "  'text': \"POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y., June 18— Feminism, the cultural patterns that perpetuated male dominance, the irrelevance of much of the current women's movement to women in minority groups and the dangers of a return to the antifeminism of the 1920's and 30's were among the themes dominating the Fifth Berkshire Conference on the History of Women, which ended here today.\\n\\nThe three-day meeting, with 136 panels and workshops on women's history since medieval times, was sponsored by Vassar College and drew almost 1,500 historians, teachers, librarians, psychologists, sociologists and anthropologists from the United States, Canada and Europe.\\n\\nA warning that ''conservative forces have captured the power to fulfill our gloomiest predictions'' was voiced by Joan W. Scott, professor of history at Brown University, in her keynote address. She said the Surgeon General-designate, Dr. C. Everett Koop, was a foe of abortion, that the Attorney General's office was being staffed ''with assistants whose careers have been dedicated to the abolition of affirmative action'' and that ''the only high-ranking woman in the Administration gives no cause for celebration.''\\n\\n''Jeane Kirkpatrick is not someone I want to represent feminine accomplishment,'' she said, speaking of the chief delegate to the United Nations.\\n\\nCiting examples of women in academic fields, Professor Scott observed that although there was little reason for optimism about what had been gained in the 1970's, the situation today was even less hopeful.\\n\\n''The circumstances of the 1980's bring to mind the 1920's and 30's,'' she said. ''Then, after the triumph of winning the vote, women faced a well-organized antifeminist movement which struck at the cultural and political bases of female solidarity.''\\n\\nParticipants in a panel on ''The Subordinate Role'' agreed that women neither accepted nor rejected it, but rather created strategies of survival and liberation somewhere between subordination and rebellion. Bonnie S. Anderson of Brooklyn College, the chairman, pointed out, too, the panelists' unanimous belief that women attempting to emerge from traditional subordinate roles found cultural restraints even more burdensome than economic limitations.\\n\\nKathleen Stassen Berger reported that five studies of more than 600 high-achieving women had found that a supporting network was of more assistance than education and paid employment in helping women realize their potential.\\n\\nFathers who encouraged autonomous development were found to be more influential in their daughters' lives than were mothers. Elder siblings were important by their absence. A disproportionate number of the women surveyed were first-borns, and of those who had elder siblings, they were more likely to be elder sisters than big brothers.\\n\\n''I suspect that big brothers themselves slow down the independence of the little sister, as they denigrate her accomplishments and 'protect' her from the outside world,'' said Professor Berger, of Bronx Community College of the City University of New York. She mentioned, as well, the prevalence, in the lives of the women studied, of a relationship with a mentor, usually a man, and the lack of husbands and children.\\n\\nGerda Lerner, professor of history at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, was one of the star attractions at the most widely attended panel. More than 500 people heard the new president of the Organization of American Historians outline ''A General Theory of Women in History.''\\n\\nThe hour-long talk, a condensation of a book in progress, advanced the thesis that the oppression of women was the model for the invention of slavery.\\n\\n''The oppression of women antedates slavery and made it possible,'' she said. The difference in the aspirations of the women's movement, as it is perceived, and those of women in minority groups was outlined by Marquita L. James, Eleanor Smith and Shirlene Soto in a panel entitled ''Toward Sisterhood? Problems and Goals.''\\n\\n''The women's movement seems to be too white, too middle class, too much a reflection of the larger society. It embraces stererotypes about minority women too readily,'' said Professor Soto, who is in the history department at the California Polytechnic State University.\\n\\nShe said, ''To the chicana, it makes little difference if she is unemployed because she is a woman or because she is chicana.'' ''Black women believe they are oppressed not by black men but by white society,'' said Professor James, of Nassau Community College in Garden City, L.I. ''Black women are almost unanimous in their insistence that their own liberation depends on the liberation of their race and the improvements of the life of the black community. White feminists must immediately begin to recognize that black women are foremost victims of oppression in this country because of their color, not their sex.''\\n\\nProfessor Smith of the University of Cincinnati offered suggestions to further mutual respect and reciprocal support. White women should examine their roles in contributing to a racist society, she said, black women should take greater strides against allowing others to speak for them and nonwhite women should ''cease trying to be white and become politically conscious of their plight as a minority and accept themselves historically and culturally.''\\n\\nFeminist perspectives on women's higher education were discussed by Florence Howe of the State University of New York, Old Westbury, L.I.; Elizabeth A. Daniels and Barbara J. Page of Vassar, Laurel Furumoto of Wellesley and Grace Haddad of Lake Erie College in Painsville, Ohio.\\n\\nOutlining conclusions based on studies of Stanford and Wellesley, Professor Howe said that higher education still resides in a universe in which maleness and femaleness are ranked, and in which women's colleges continue to be seen as not mainstream, without the power to effect change.\\n\\nSandi Cooper, president of the conference, was chairman of ''Government Surveillance and the Control of Women,'' one of the most discussed panels of the conference. Among the participants were Blanche Wiesen Cook of John Jay College, who spoke on ''The Repression and Resistance of Women in America, from the F.B.I. to the Moral Majority,'' and Amy Swerdlow of Sarah Lawrence College, who discussed the 1962 confrontation between the Women's Strike for Peace and the House Committee on Un-American Activities. Bettina Aptheker of the University of California at Santa Cruz told of her own experiences of surveillance, imprisonment, beatings and rape as a political activist during the 1960's.\\n\\nOther panels included papers by Elizabeth Pleck of the Wellesley College Center for Research on Women, on how life in the United States challenged the patriarchal authority of the Old World family, and by Diana Grossman Kahn, a clinical psychologist at the Bunting Insitute, Radcliffe College, who raised the possibility that some women's aspirations were related to their mother's lost ambitions.\\n\\nIllustrations: photo of Joan Scott photo of Sandi Cooper and Gerda Lerner\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Similarly I went to visit INSEAD in Fontainebleau [France], 45 minutes outside of Paris by train--a well-known international business school [with a second campus in Singapore]. You can do your whole degree in Singapore or start in Singapore and go to Fontainebleau or do the whole program in Fontainebleau. I don't know what you exactly call it--sort of a multinational campus.\\n\\nIt is not that they are doing so many bells and whistles with their curriculum. They are seeing themselves as not as part of a local or regional or national market but as part of the business world. They see themselves as competing globally, and they are adjusting their behavior accordingly.\\n\\nThere are many students, who for various reasons, [like] capacity limits; are not getting a great secondary-school education. They don't go to the mainstream universities, but they are hungry for education. They particularly want vocational education to get good jobs, so you have students going to for-profit universities studying very practical subjects like nursing, tourism or accounting. And the for-profits, sometimes using technology and distance learning, are really jumping on that and they are doing very well.\\n\\nWhat is the relationship between the global education marketplace and the marketplace for professional talent?\\n\\nThere is an extremely close connection between the way in which we are seeing the development of a global meritocracy for students and for universities and the global search for talent in the world of business.\\n\\nWhat's happening is the university has greater mobility because of the shifting mindset in terms of seeing themselves as global. Universities are seeking talent wherever they can find it. When I was in India at one of the Indian Institutes of Technology [IITs], the elite engineering schools, the MITs of India. ... You go into one of the career services offices and there are sign-up sheets for interviews with Google and McKinsey, and I saw the poster that was advertising graduate student scholarships to go to KAUST, the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. They are trying to find the best students in India, among other places, to recruit.\\n\\nOnce you have the kind of mobility of students to go study in another country and often stay on if they can to work, that creates a global flow of brain power that businesses can tap. One of the challenges is the notion of academic protectionism, which can constitute all kinds of restrictions on mobility. Visa barriers are a problem for universities, but they are also a problem for businesses.\\n\\nIn the U.S. we have limits on H-1B visas for talented immigrants, and also limits on green cards. That has an impact on our businesses and our economy, because we need the best talent we can find. The bottom line is the free flow of people and ideas is growing, and it is extremely important for universities and businesses that want the top talent. I think our challenge is to make sure that it grows even faster and remove whatever restrictions still exist.\\n\\nWhat is the risk of not becoming a global university?\\n\\nOne of the great strength of universities in the United States is that we have a tremendous diversity. The elite tiered universities to the flagship publics, to the non-selective publics to the non-selective privates, to the community colleges. That is terrific for us.\\n\\nFor all the latest headlines visit Forbes Asia.\",\n",

The most important thing is the effort to develop world-class research universities that can compete with the best. Part of it involves a notion that is now widely accepted, that human capital absolutely is crucial in creating innovation and economic growth and universities are the way we improve human capital.\\n\\nSo places like China are trying to improve capacity; they are trying to improve the quantity of university seats that are available and also the quality of their universities. They are singling out ... universities for extra funding to try to make those particularly competitive.\\n\\nIndia--which has many problems in its higher education system--at least has set very ambitious goals in expanding the number of seats. It has a population that is hungry for knowledge.\\n\\nWhat then is going to come to define the university, or really, the higher education, of the future?\\n\\nThe first thing I would say it is dangerous to make predictions. Because we know that in the 19th century Germany pioneered research and teaching under one roof--in the first research university. Americans went to Germany to study the model and came back and eventually copied that model, i.e., John Hopkins University and the University of Chicago. We took it and perfected it, and after WWII we created the best research universities in the world. ... Right now the Germans are coming to look at our model to improve their universities, which have fallen into mediocrity. A lot can happen in 100 or 150 years.\\n\\nSometimes in the United States we tend to mistakenly fall into the \"us vs. them\" mentality: \"The Chinese are graduating more Ph.D.s. What are we going to do? We are losing the race? We have to be competitive.\" It\\'s fine to be more competitive, but it is not a zero-sum game. So there are more smart people with Ph.D.s in China. That is good for us--it is not bad for us.\\n\\nKnowledge is not a finite resource that everybody has to fight over to get their piece of the pie. It\\'s something that can grow. Economists often say that knowledge is a public good. When there is a research discovery in one country, you can\\'t keep it within national borders.\\n\\nIt\\'s entirely possible that new universities in other countries will create knowledge that gets taken advantage of by American innovators and entrepreneurs, that they will create great new products from that knowledge. ... We should embrace those forces of globalization in education just as the forces of globalization in the rest of the economy are very healthy.\\n\\nFor all the latest headlines visit Forbes Asia.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Finance chiefs from the world’s biggest economies signaled escalating concern about a wave of anti-globalization sentiment that threatens core principles long embraced by the group.\\n\\nMeeting in China one month after a shock decision by U.K voters to exit the European Union, finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20 put a stepped-up emphasis on fiscal and structural policies to boost growth, and renewed a pledge to promote inclusiveness. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, whose own country has seen millions of people embrace the protectionist calls of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, said Brexit had escalated the importance of inclusive economic expansion.\\n\\n\"There was a consensus around the table that more needs to be done to share the benefits of growth and economic openness broadly within and among countries,\" International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde said in a statement after the two-day G-20 meeting ended Sunday. Her counterpart, World Bank President Jim Yong Kim, warned Friday that there was a very loud rejection of globalization in the West.\\n\\nWhile no G-20 member promised any specific fresh action in Chengdu, many had already been taking steps in the run-up to the gathering. Japan is in the midst of compiling an extra budget, with calls from some lawmakers for support for lower-income households. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has also called for bolstering wages of workers on temporary contracts.\\n\\nIn the epicenter of Brexit, Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond indicated openness to a more generous budget on July 22, when he told the BBC the U.K. could \"reset fiscal policy\" if necessary. For his part, Lew said the U.S. economy is in strong shape, and held off making any new commitments.\\n\\nWith some exceptions -- notably Germany -- the result is a reversal of years of antagonism over whether to pursue pro-growth policies versus reining in debt. Lew told reporters in Chengdu that there’s a broad consensus the world needs growth, not austerity. The need for inclusive growth was given prominence in the second paragraph of the G-20 communique.\\n\\nIn a pile of documents left behind at the G-20 meetings was one with the title of being a \"zero draft\" of the leaders’ communique for the summit in Hangzhou Sept. 4-5, and it included some stark language: \"The world economy stands at a crossroads,\" the paper dated July 15 said. \"We will work to build an open world economy, reject protectionism, promote global trade and investment, ensuring broad-based public support for expanded growth in a globalized economy.\"\\n\\n\"If there’s one message coming out of this G-20 meeting it’s that they’re starting to get the message that electorates around the world aren’t happy with the way things have been proceeding,\" said Shane Oliver, Sydney-based head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which manages more than $110 billion.\\n\\nHours after the G-20 meeting concluded, a further risk to the global trade order emerged, with Trump comments broadcast on NBC’s \"Meet the Press.\" The candidate for president in the November election said that if the World Trade Organization tried to block his proposal to tax goods of U.S. companies that sent operations out of the U.S., “then we’re going to renegotiate or we’re going to pull out.”\\n\\nChina, the world’s second-biggest economy, has plenty of reason to ensure inclusive growth, as its slowing expansion risks eroding the income gains needed to spur consumption and services. The government has been pumping cheap credit into banks, companies and local governments, and in June alone an additional $244 billion in new credit flowed into the economy.\\n\\nSouth Korea, Asia’s No. 4 economy, has unveiled an 11 trillion won ($9.7 billion) supplementary budget to support the jobs market. Canada is adding C$11 billion ($8.38 billion) in annual spending for the fiscal year that began April 1 and will run deficits totaling almost C$120 billion over six years.\\n\\nAt the G-20 itself, the group recommitted to keeping clear of competitive currency devaluations. Unlike at a Shanghai gathering in February, there was little focus on the yuan, which has seen much less volatility in recent months. In Beijing Sunday, People’s Bank of China Deputy Governor Chen Yulu said the central bank will work hard to keep the yuan stable against a basket of currencies.\\n\\n\"All forms of protectionism\" will be resisted, the G-20 said. \"The global economic recovery continues but remains weaker than desirable\" and \"the global economic environment is challenging and downside risks persist, highlighted by fluctuating commodity prices, and low inflation in many economies.\"\\n\\nThe group also said that \"financial market volatility remains high, and geopolitical conflicts, terrorism, and refugee flows continue to complicate the global economic environment.\"\\n\\nEven so, the G-20 signaled optimism with regard to managing any growth threats from Brexit. Members are \"well positioned to proactively address the potential economic and financial consequences,\" they said. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said that despite some market volatility after Brexit, there’s been quite a lot of stabilization.\\n\\nThe G-20 sought again to de-emphasize the role of monetary policy, repeating past conclusions that such stimulus on its own cannot achieve balanced growth. That conclusion didn’t stop group members including India, Australia and South Korea from cutting interest rates since the February meeting.\\n\\nBank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda noted that monetary and fiscal efforts in combination can be effective in helping the economy. Speaking to reporters days before the BOJ’s July 28-29 policy meeting, he reiterated that he is prepared to step up stimulus if needed, while noting again that so-called helicopter money is prohibited.\\n\\nThe communique noted that overcapacity in industries like steel making are a challenge not just for trade, but also for workers, and require a collective global response. While no new mechanism for such talks was announced, Lew reiterated his backing for a multilateral effort to discuss steel capacity. China is already engaged in reforms to eliminate excesses in its old-line industries.\\n\\n\"After many years of sub-par growth in industrialized economies, and increasingly also in emerging markets, G-20 leaders are recognizing the risks of social cleavages and their potentially harmful economic consequences,\" said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC Holdings Plc in Hong Kong. \"More inclusive growth, protecting society’s most vulnerable, will increasingly be woven into economic policy.\"\\n\\nNeumann anticipates measures including greater transfer payments to lower-income groups, additional job training, a more progressive tax structure, and spending plans that provide greater health care and old-age assistance.\\n\\n— With assistance by Rainer Buergin, Saleha Mohsin, Enda Curran, Yinan Zhao, Toru Fujioka, Jana Randow, and Raymond Colitt',\n",

       "  'date': '2016071419',\n",
       "  'text': 'Globalization—that irresistible force that was inevitably, inexorably making the world flat—looks to be in retreat. Trade growth has never recovered to the levels reached before the 2008 financial crisis. Donald Trump is fueling his presidential campaign on fear of free trade and immigration. The economic problems of the U.S., he blasted in a June speech, are “the consequence of a leadership class that worships globalism over Americanism.” Then came Brexit, the worst setback for the European Union, that most ambitious experiment in globalization. Money manager Bill Gross said Brexit marks “the end of globalization as we’ve known it.”\\n\\nIn a sense, Gross is correct. The rich West launched globalization on the ideal that nations tied together by bonds of trade, money, and culture are less likely to destroy one another. Now those in the U.S. and Europe who believe themselves hurt by the massive changes wrought by globalization want to reverse it. Isolationism is being heralded as independence.\\n\\nBut anyone who thinks globalization is dead misreads what’s really happening. While there are pockets of resistance, much of the world is still forging tighter links between countries, companies, and communities. Rather than retrenching, globalization is deepening and expanding—whether angry Trump supporters or British Leave voters like it or not.\\n\\nThis new and perhaps even more exciting phase of globalization presents serious challenges for policymakers, especially in the U.S. and Europe. As working classes—suffering from stagnant incomes and joblessness—lash out at the free movement of money, goods, and people, their elected politicians face pressure to detach from an increasingly interconnected world. In doing so, though, they may cede to non-Western competitors the potential benefits these fresh linkages will create. The fate of nations may depend on whether they continue to embrace globalization.\\n\\nThat’s been the case for decades. The first round of globalization was, generally, a movement from the West to the rest. As the open exchange encouraged by the U.S.-led global economic system and advancing technology smoothed the way for doing business on an international scale, finance and factories flowed from the richest countries to the poorest. With them came Western doctrines (from capitalism to evangelical Christianity) and Western culture (from McDonald’s to Mickey Mouse). The countries that took advantage—China, Japan, South Korea, and, yes, the U.S.—reaped the rewards. Developing countries alleviated poverty on an unprecedented scale, while advanced nations gained greater economic efficiency. Countries that sat on the sidelines—Russia, much of the Middle East, and Africa—are still trying to make up lost ground.\\n\\nThe success of that early phase of globalization has spawned another—one that moves in all directions. Emerging economies are knitting closer ties among themselves as China, India, and others gain in wealth, clout, and confidence. The World Trade Organization figures that 52 percent of developing countries’ exports went to other emerging economies in 2014, up from 38 percent in 1995. Trade between China and India was $1.7 billion in 1997. By 2014 it had ballooned to $72 billion. India’s total trade with Africa grew more than 60 percent in only four years, to almost $48 billion in the country’s 2014-15 fiscal year.\\n\\nMost of the world continues to pursue free trade, even as Trump derides the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, as a “disaster,” and Brexit excises Europe’s second-largest economy from the continent’s integrated market. China is pushing for a pan-Asia free-trade zone; the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations is forming a common market; and African countries have started negotiating a continentwide free-trade area.\\n\\nToday’s globalization is also drawing in countries previously left out. Textile and apparel manufacturers from Bangladesh, China, and Turkey invested $2.2 billion in Ethiopia last year to open factories to export to the U.S. and Europe. The Philippines, long a laggard in a region replete with hyperconnected economies, has become a major hub for call centers.\\n\\nNew institutions are forming to support these trends. In June the China-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a development organization akin to the World Bank, approved its first four loans, totaling $509 million, for projects in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Tajikistan. Two months earlier, the New Development Bank—founded by Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, and headquartered in Shanghai—announced its first loans. They totaled $811 million and will fund renewable energy projects in the BRICS countries, except for Russia.\\n\\nCompanies from the emerging world are becoming more important investors as well. According to the American Enterprise Institute, Chinese companies invested $111 billion around the world in 2015—more than 10 times the amount in 2005. The total that Indian companies have invested abroad, at $139 billion in 2015, rose 43 percent in only five years, growing faster than the amount of foreign money invested in India. During a June visit to China, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the two countries are jointly undertaking investment projects worth $50 billion.\\n\\nGrowing antipathy toward immigrants hasn’t kept people at home, either. The World Bank estimates that the number of international migrants rose to a record 251 million last year. More than 38 percent of them moved from a developing country to another developing country in 2013, compared with 34 percent to advanced economies.\\n\\nOf course, this new globalization may encounter its share of Brexit-like setbacks. Trade among emerging economies hasn’t escaped the global slowdown. The WTO estimates that the growth of exports among developing economies slumped to 1.3 percent in 2014, down sharply from about 33 percent only four years earlier. In some cases, the ties between nations are tightening less than they appear. Despite the high-level friendship between China and Russia, persistent distrust has kept many of their promises of cooperation just that—promises. And politicians and policymakers intent on turning back globalism can hamper progress for everyone. Trump’s protectionism, if ever implemented, could spark retaliatory measures capable of dragging down global growth. In Europe, German Chancellor Angela Merkel is talking tough on Brexit, saying the U.K. cannot go “cherry-picking” what it wants and doesn’t from EU membership. The trauma of the U.K.’s impending exit is expected to dampen growth not only in Europe, but possibly around the world.\\n\\nYet the foes of globalization won’t be able to stop it. Too many countries see their future as part of something bigger. India long harbored doubts about participating in globalization, but after liberalizing rules on foreign direct investment in June, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office tweeted that his country is the “most open economy in the world for FDI.” Next door in Myanmar, military rulers gave in to democratic reform after realizing their impoverished country could no longer remain isolated. They hope to gain from the opportunities embedded in this latest round of globalization—new sources of growth, finance, and profits; new founts of information and innovation; new job creators and consumers; and new ideas sprouting in a newly emerging global culture.\\n\\nThose who blame globalization for their problems think they’ll be better off watching from the sidelines. Trump and his supporters contend that erecting walls—literally and figuratively—will protect U.S. jobs and industry from an unfair global economy. But early indications say otherwise. The pound’s steep post-Brexit swoon is a signal that investors believe the U.K. is less competitive outside an integrated Europe than within it. In Paris and Frankfurt, bankers and politicians are eager to capitalize on Brexit to siphon off financial business from London.\\n\\nInstead of pandering to isolationist forces, politicians would do better to address their very real concerns directly. Workers displaced by free trade need more intensive training to prepare them for new jobs. University education must become less expensive, and vocational schools more available. Allowing labor a greater voice in corporate management will help wage earners share more equitably in the profits globalization creates for Big Business. As the world continues to flatten, opponents of that inevitable, inexorable change must mind the edge.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Within a century of Henry Ford\\'s first assembly line, the entire world economy has become a single, virtual conveyor belt. And that belt is getting hot.\\n\\nWhen weather catastrophes hit, the big-ticket damages tend to come not from heat waves but from floods, hurricanes, and wildfires. Natural disasters caused billions of dollars in damage last month alone, according to a recent report, from Canadian wildfires ($3.1 billion), to European flooding ($4.6 billion), to U.S. storm damage ($1 billion).\\n\\nThe economic loss from 300 Indian heatwave deaths in April however is listed as “unknown.” That may not be the case for long, as such deaths are the latest canary in the coal mine—or any mine, rainforest, or valley across the Earth\\'s hot middle, where the building blocks of the developed economies are gouged out of the ground.\\n\\nManufacturing these days involves facilities in multiple countries, each of which has a sequential role in taking raw materials a step closer to being finished products. Imported materials may remain unfinished, even after they\\'re exported to the next station on the international assembly line. This “vertical specialization,” it turns out, may have a blind spot when it comes to climate change, according to new research from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Manufacturing is only as strong as the weakest, or in this case hottest, link in the supply chain.\\n\\nThis graphic shows which nations have become more dependent on supplies from India from 1991 to 2011.\\n\\nSOURCE: Wenz et al; Science Advances\\n\\nThe study is based on trade flows among 26 sectors within 186 countries. Sifting through economic, population, and temperature data, Leonie Wenz and Anders Levermann found that the risk of economic losses from worker heat stress doubled from 2001 to 2011. The losses percolated down supply chains almost imperceptibly. But while the absolute losses are negligible at this point, Levermann said, the rate of change should be enough to call attention to the growing risks as the world warms.\\n\\n\"We usually think that trade will allow us to adapt to climate change,\" said Solomon Hsiang, a public-policy professor at the University of California-Berkeley who has studied the effects of climate change on economic performance, \"but this analysis highlights ways in which vulnerability to climatic events might actually increase our exposure to climatic risks.\"\\n\\nHsiang said that, similar trends in the U.S. amplified the economic impact of hurricanes on inland states by raising the cost of capital nationwide.\\n\\nBy 2011, globalization may have made supply chains less resilient to heatwaves. This chart shows the estimated production losses linked to heat stress under a high carbon-pollution scenario, given the structure of the global economy in 1991, 2001, and 2011.\\n\\nSOURCE: Wenz et al; Science Advances\\n\\nHow heat affects worker productivity is a topic that’s been studied a long time.\\n\\nWith hotter temperatures looming, researchers have studied what that means for whole economies. An average annual temperature of about 55 degrees Fahrenheit (13 degrees Celsius) may be optimal working conditions. When the mercury rises past about 80F, workers start to become less productive in industries like mining, construction, or forestry, where there’s no escaping into an air conditioned offices.\\n\\nWhile this Potsdam paper looked at the effects of heat, Levermann said he expects that other meteorological wallops getting the most attention—floods, drought, storms—will be shown to have a similar effect on what may be an increasingly fragile global manufacturing bucket brigade.',\n",

And women, she claims, are inherently more committed to being with their children than men, so marriages in which men do the lion’s share of parenting will still leave women feeling emotionally unfulfilled.\\n\\nThere is so much that is wrong with this argument:\\n\\n1. Slaughter’s article is written from a vantage point of extreme privilege. Most women aren’t making choices – they ‘do it all’ because there is no other option. Most women and men would regard a tenured job at Princeton as a high-powered full-time career; Slaughter sees it as a form of settling after giving up her State Department gig. The idea that this is a woman who doesn’t ‘have it all’ is hard to swallow.\\n\\n2. Then there is the essentialism of her claims about the need to make the economy more flexible for women. Women, she says, should not have to see success as meaning working round the clock; women should be encouraged to take more time off. But men, it seems, should be allowed to go on as they have been, working nights and weekends and rarely seeing their children. Because, Slaughter says, it will bother fathers less to have their spouses or a nanny looking after their kids than it will bother mothers.\\n\\nThis is the kind of claim that demands data, and Slaughter has none. She doesn’t make room for women who don’t want children at all, or acknowledge that a great many men hate the pressure put on them to be breadwinners only and fear the ridicule that comes from suggesting they might want to do more parenting.\\n\\n3. Her proposals are weak. The idea that more women in public office will lead to a dramatic change in economic policy for women is a nice thought, but it’s not necessarily true. The suggestion that mandating more parental leave will help is naïve: either only women will take it, furthering the achievement gap at work, or men will take it too, but might use it as a sabbatical to advance their careers or take a vacation, not to focus on parenting. This is one of the many cases where cultural change cannot be simply legislated.\\n\\n4. But, what perhaps bothered me most about the piece, was Slaughter’s narrow understanding of what feminism is. She claims that feminism promised women the following: the ability to have a completely unencumbered, full-time career and a completely involved, cook-dinner-every-day experience of motherhood without making any compromises. This is a straw man.\\n\\nShe counters it with an equally bogus vision of what feminism is: that we validate whatever paths women choose as feminist choices because women make them. This isn’t feminism, because it does nothing to advance the lot of women overall.\\n\\nHere’s what I mean: Slaughter seems blissfully unaware of the consequences of an economy in which some or many women opt for greater flexibility to work fewer hours, but men do not. As I’ve written before, the individual choices of couples where women stay home some or all the time have the aggregate effect of dragging down wages and professional success for women generally.\\n\\nFeminism is about equality. Repeat that until it sinks in.\\n\\nFeminism means giving women equal opportunity and fair pay at work. It means a world where taking time off to be a parent is considered equally legitimate for men and women. It means, fundamentally, a world in which men and women have equal access to the full spectrum of human experience.\\n\\nIt does not mean making a world in which each woman does everything at once, the ‘have it all’ fantasy. It does not mean making a world in which each woman does whatever she wants without consequence, the choice fallacy. It means making a world in which each individual (male or female) can make their own compromises (and life will always involve compromises) without taking away opportunities from others.\\n\\nThat is a radical, utopian vision, to be sure, but it is not the utopia Slaughter claims feminism sold her, or the one she would like us to replace it with.',\n",

       "  'text': 'A ragtag army of save-the-world crusaders has spent years decrying multinational corporations as villains in the wave of globalization overwhelming the Third World. This ominous trend would fatten the rich, further impoverish and oppress the poor and crush local economies.\\n\\nThe business-bashing group Public Citizen argued as much in a proclamation signed by almost 1,500 organizations in 89 countries in 1999. Whereupon hundreds of protesters rioted outside a conference of the World Trade Organization in Seattle, shattering windows, blocking traffic and confronting cops armed with tear gas and pepper spray. Six hundred people were arrested.\\n\\nCut to 2007, and the numbers are in: The protesters and do-gooders are just plain wrong. It turns out globalization is good--and not just for the rich, but especially for the poor. The booming economies of India and China--the Elephant and the Dragon--have lifted 200 million people out of abject poverty in the 1990s as globalization took off, the International Monetary Fund says. Tens of millions more have catapulted themselves far ahead into the middle class.\\n\\nIt\\'s remarkable what a few container ships can do to make poor people better off. Certainly more than $2 trillion of foreign aid, which is roughly the amount (with an inflation adjustment) that the U.S. and Europe have poured into Africa and Asia over the past half-century.\\n\\nIn the next eight years almost 1 billion people across Asia will take a Great Leap Forward into a new middle class. In China middle-class incomes are set to rise threefold, to $5,000, predicts Dominic Barton, a Shanghai managing partner for McKinsey & Co.\\n\\nAs the Chindia revolution spreads, the ranks of the poor get smaller, not larger. In the 1990s, as Vietnam\\'s economy grew 6% a year, the number of people living in poverty (42 million) fell 7% annually; in Uganda, when GDP growth passed 3%, the number fell 6% per year, says the World Bank.\\n\\nChina unleashed its economy in 1978, seeding capitalism first among farmers newly freed to sell the fruits of their fields instead of handing the produce over to Communist Party collectives. Other reforms let the Chinese create 22 million new businesses that now employ 135 million people who otherwise would have remained peasants like the generations before them.\\n\\nForeign direct investment, the very force so virulently opposed by the do-gooders, has helped drive China\\'s gross domestic product to a more than tenfold increase since 1978. Since the reforms started, $600 billion has flooded into the country, $70 billion of it in the past year. Foreigners built hundreds of thousands of new factories as the Chinese government built the coal mines, power grid, airports and highways to supply them.\\n\\nAs China built infrastructure, it created Special Economic Zones where foreign companies willing to build modern factories could hire cheap labor, go years without paying any taxes and leave it to government to build the roads and other infrastructure they needed. All of that, in turn, drove China\\'s exports from $970 million to $974 billion in three decades. Those container loads make Americans better off, too. You can get a Chinese DVD at Wal-Mart (nyse: WMT - news - people ) for $28, and after you do you will buy some $15 movies made in the U.S.A.\\n\\nPer-person income in China has climbed from $16 a year in 1978 to $2,000 now. Wages in factory boomtowns in southern China can run $4 a day--scandalously low in the eyes of the protesters, yet up from pennies a day a generation ago and far ahead of increases in living costs.\\n\\nMiddle-class Chinese families now own TVs, live in new apartments and send their children to private schools. Millions of Chinese have traded in their bicycles for motorcycles or cars. McDonald\\'s (nyse: MCD - news - people ) has signed a deal with Sinopec, the huge Chinese gasoline retailer, to build drive-through restaurants attached to gas stations on China\\'s new roads.\\n\\nToday 254 Starbucks (nasdaq: SBUX - news - people ) stores serve coffee in the land of tea, including one at the Great Wall and another at the Forbidden Palace. (The latter is the target of protesters.) In Beijing 54 Starbucks shops thrive, peddling luxury lattes that cost up to $2.85 a cup and paying servers $6 for an 8-hour day. That looks exploitative until you peek inside a nearby Chinese-owned teahouse where the staff works a 12-hour day for $3.75.\\n\\nSays one woman, 23, who works for an international cargo shipper in Beijing: \"My parents were both teachers when they were my age, and they earned 30 yuan [$3.70] a month. I earn 4,000 yuan ($500) a month, live comfortably and feel I have better opportunities than my parents did.\"\\n\\nTony Ma, age 51, was an unwilling foot soldier in Mao\\'s Cultural Revolution. During that dark period from 1966 to 1976 universities were closed, and he was sent at age 16 to work in a steel mill for $2 a month. He cut metal all day long for seven years and feared he might never escape.\\n\\nWhen colleges reopened, he landed a spot to study chemistry, transferred to the U.S., got a Ph.D. in biochemistry and signed on with Johnson & Johnson (nyse: JNJ - news - people ) at $45,000 a year. Later he returned to the land he fled and now works for B.F. Goodrich (nyse: GR - news - people ) in Hong Kong.\\n\\nThe young college grads in China today wouldn\\'t bother immigrating to the U.S. for a job that pays $45,000, he says--because now they have better opportunities at home.\\n\\nCapitalism alone, however, isn\\'t enough to remake Third World economies--globalism is the key. A big reason India trails behind its bigger neighbor to the northeast in lifting the lower classes is that, even after embracing capitalism, it kept barriers to the flow of capital from abroad.\\n\\nThus 77% of Indians live on $2 a day or less, the Asian Development Bank says, down only nine percentage points from 1990. A third of the population is illiterate. In 1980 India had more of its population in urban centers than China did (23% versus 20% for China). But by 2005 China had 41% in cities, where wages are higher; India\\'s urbanites had grown to only 29%.\\n\\nFreed of British colonial rule in 1947 and scarred by its paternalistic effects, India initially combined capitalism with economic isolationism. It thwarted foreign companies intent on investing there and hampered Indian firms trying to sell abroad. This hurt Indian consumers and local biz: A $100 Microsoft (nasdaq: MSFT - news - people ) operating system got slapped with duties that brought the price to $250 in India, putting imported software and computers further from reach for most people and businesses. Meanwhile, the government granted workers lavish job protections and imposed heavy taxes and regulations on employers. Government jobs usually were by rote and paid poorly, but they guaranteed lifetime employment. They also ensured economic stagnation.\\n\\nFinancial crisis struck in 1991. Desperate for cash, India flew a planeload of gold reserves to London and began, grudgingly, to open its economy. Import duties were lowered or eliminated, so India\\'s consumers and companies could buy modern, foreign-made goods and gear. Overseas firms in many industries were allowed to own their subsidiaries in India for the first time since 1977. India all but banned foreign investment until 1991. Since then foreign companies have come back, but not yet on the scale seen in China. Foreign companies have invested $48 billion in India since 1991--$7.5 billion of that just in the last fiscal year--the same amount dumped into China every six weeks. By the mid-1990s the economy boomed and created millions of jobs.\\n\\nBy the late 1990s U.S. tech companies began turning to India for software design, particularly in the Y2K crunch. The Indians proved capable and cheap, and the much- maligned offshoring boom began. Suddenly Indian software engineers were programming corporate America\\'s computers. New college graduates were answering America\\'s customer service phone calls. Builders hired construction workers to erect new high-rise buildings suddenly in demand as American and European firms rushed to hire Indian workers.\\n\\nThe new college hires, whose older siblings had graduated without finding a job, tell of surpassing their parents\\' salaries within five years and of buying cell phones, then motorcycles, then cars and even houses by the time they were 30. All of that would have been impossible had India failed to add globalization to capitalism.\\n\\nToday, despite its still dilapidated airports and pothole-riddled highways, the lumbering Elephant now is in a trot, growing more than 7% annually for the last decade. In 2005, borrowing from the Chinese, India began a five-year, $150 billion plan to update its roads, airports, ports and electric plants. India is creating free trade zones, like those in China, to encourage exports of software, apparel, auto parts and more.\\n\\nS.B. Kutwal manages the assembly line where Tata Motors (nyse: TTM - news - people ) builds Safari SUVs ( click here for more). He remembers how, in the 1980s, people waited five years to buy a scooter and cars were only for the rich. \"Since we\\'ve liberated the economy, lots of companies have started coming into India,\" says Kutwal. \"People couldn\\'t afford cars then. Now the buying power is coming.\"\\n\\nIn Mumbai (formerly Bombay), Delhi, Bangalore and other big cities, shopping malls have sprung up, selling everything from Levi\\'s jeans to Versace. India still has raggedy street touts, but when they tap on car windows at stoplights, instead of peddling cheap plastic toys, they sell to the new India: copies of Vogue and House & Garden magazines. Western restaurants are moving in, too: Domino\\'s Pizza (nyse: DPZ - news - people ) and Ruby Tuesday (nyse: RI - news - people )\\'s have come to India, and 107 McDonald\\'s have sprung up, serving veggie burgers in the land where cattle are sacred.\\n\\nNone of this gives pause to an entity called International Forum on Globalization. The group declares that globalism\\'s aim is to \"benefit transnational corporations over workers; foreign investors over local businesses; and wealthy countries over developing nations. While promoters proclaim that this model is the rising tide that will lift all boats, citizen movements find that it is instead lifting only yachts.\"\\n\\n\"The majority of people in rich and poor countries aren\\'t better off\" since the World Trade Organization formed in 1995 to promote global trade, asserts Christopher Slevin, deputy director of Global Trade Watch, an arm of Ralph Nader\\'s Public Citizen. \"The breadth of the opposition has grown. It\\'s not just industrial and steel workers and people who care about animal rights. It includes high-tech workers and the offshoring of jobs, also the faith-based community.\"\\n\\nRead Forbes Editor William Baldwin\\x92s Side Lines On This Story.\\n\\nSubscribe to Forbes and Save.

       "  'text': 'To some extent, the rebalancing of global economic activity from developed to emerging markets simply reflects economic laws of gravity. In a world where ideas can flow freely and countries are at different stages in adopting modern modes of production, communication and distribution, less developed nations should grow more rapidly than their counterparts in the West as they catch up.\\n\\nBut it\\'s also important to understand that emerging-market economies have a structural advantage that is grounded in the operation of the global economy. Saber-rattling Western trade negotiators frequently focus their attention on the \"unnaturally\" depressed exchange rates of countries such as China, and this is a component of the structural advantage to which I refer. But its roots run far deeper--all the way down to the fundamental issue that labor can\\'t be freely traded on a single global market, while capital and commodities can. Any company sourcing its production or service operations in a lower-wage emerging-market country therefore can save enormously on labor costs. That\\'s painful for displaced Western workers, but it\\'s good for the company\\'s profits, good for consumers in developed markets and good for the newly minted citizens of the global economy who are working in emerging-market factories and call centers. This is a dynamic we take so much for granted that it\\'s easy to imagine it as a semi-permanent condition that will underpin global economic development for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nBut what if it weren\\'t? This article explains why we should consider that seeming improbability and examines the possibility that financial crises may accelerate the transition to a global economy with more balanced trade, capital flows and consumption. I believe senior executives need to prepare now for a world that--as China\\'s recent decision to relax its informal peg of the yuan to the U.S. dollar underscores--will be coming to grips with an unsustainable set of economic relationships. Their unwinding will have serious long-term implications for those executives\\' strategic priorities, including where they locate operations and what customers they serve in which markets. Equally important is the need for preparedness in case the unwinding process is sudden and abrupt. While we surely seem to be headed toward a new global equilibrium, the transition to that future world may not be smooth and gradual.\\n\\nAdam Smith meets the global economy\\n\\nWe usually think of the global economy in terms of outputs such as cars and packaged goods. Yet the real integration of the world\\'s economy begins with factors of production. Of those, commodities, capital and labor are the most important for understanding our structural economic issues. The test of whether a market has fully formed is whether all customers get the same items at the same price, allowing for transaction and transportation costs. (This condition, called the law of one price, was originally advanced by Adam Smith.) Such market conditions have long existed at a global level for natural commodities, such as crude oil, bauxite and iron ore, as well as for manufactured commodities, such as petroleum, aluminum and steel. The law of one price also exists for freely traded foreign exchange and most instruments traded in the capital market. It does not exist for labor, however--which is the fundamental structural issue the global economy faces.\\n\\nFor the complete article, click here.',\n",

       "  'text': 'ForbesWoman is a new section for professional and executive women. Enter your email below to start receiving ForbesWoman news and updates.\\n\\nAgainst the backdrop of Iran\\'s political turmoil, Iranian-American journalist Roya Hakakian sat down with ForbesWoman to discuss her native country\\'s current climate and the situation facing women--and men--in Iran today.\\n\\nBorn in Tehran, Hakakian is the author of several collections of poetry and Journey from the Land of No, a memoir. She left Iran in 1984 at the age of 18. She has not returned nor has she been permitted to return. She now lives in Connecticut.\\n\\nExcerpts from her interview with ForbesWoman follow.\\n\\nForbes: What was your first reaction to seeing women among the protesters in the streets of Iran?\\n\\nHakakian: The presence of women is not a surprise to me at all.\\n\\nIran has had a robust women\\'s movement for several decades now. But in the late 1990s, a new generation took charge; and in the early 2000s, they managed to organize and unite in ways that women had not since the revolution in 1979. It started as petition movement to collect signatures to ban stoning women to death and has spun out to become the \"One Million Signatures Campaign.\" So this is precisely what I expected.\\n\\nWhat\\'s the extent of risk these demonstrators are taking?\\n\\nBy looking at pictures and YouTube videos, I can see the regime is using certain tactics: Plainclothes operatives with knives circulate through the crowd and bring out these knives and just as they are feeling safe because they are next to like-minded people who are demonstrating too, the operatives start to attack the protesters.\\n\\nWhen one thinks back to 1978 and 1979 and overthrowing the Shah, it\\'s not remotely comparable. Even though I was young, I could see that the people knew who they were demonstrating against. There was a clear face-off between the Shah\\'s guards and armies and the rest of the people. The boundaries were very clear. This regime doesn\\'t honor that.\\n\\nSome reports have noted the regime\\'s use of non-Persian-speaking police. Because the regime is afraid of the police switching loyalties, it has imported crowd control from other Arab countries so demonstrators on street can\\'t communicate with them. Iranians speak Persian and Arabs speak Arabic so they can\\'t be converted and brought to the other side.\\n\\nWomen are not particular targets. At this point, I don\\'t think it really matters to [the regime] whether it\\'s women, men, young or old.\\n\\nWhat provides some measure of safety is the sheer volume of people that have taken to the streets. In the past 15 years, we have never had one million people marching on the streets of Tehran. Students have marched, yes, but there have been more than a million people demonstrating in the past two to three days. The crowds should are fed up and willing to pay the price.\\n\\nIs this a moment of change for women?\\n\\nYes. The feminist movement, which has been ongoing in Iran, has now joined the broader public movement against the regime. This happened in Iran in the late 1970s too, but it had actually a terrible effect on the women\\'s movement in Iran. Women were somehow \"hoodwinked\" to think that the veil wasn\\'t such an important issue, that it was more important to sacrifice for the greater good. So the Shah went and the veil stayed.\\n\\nThis generation is a lot smarter. The broader social movement is far more sympathetic to the cause of women than in the late 1970s. Thirty years later, Iranian men now realize that their fate is entwined with that of their female counterparts: If women are doing better, then men will do better too.\\n\\nDoes Mousavi\\'s wife--Zahra Rahnavard--in any way represent a new face of women in Iran?\\n\\nHer presence on the political scene is, if anything, a manifestation of the strength of the feminist movement. It was a smart strategy to bring her out and make her visible. Mousavi wanted to court women who constitute a huge voting block and are extremely powerful and know how to organize. So, [Rahnavard] speaks more to the feminist movement than anything else.\\n\\nWhat role has the Internet and modern technology played in helping Iranian women to get their message out?\\n\\nI think it\\'s enormous. I have a Facebook page with several hundred people friending me from Iran. These are people I\\'ve never known. They post photographs, film clips, news items. I haven\\'t looked at any television broadcasts I only look at television broadcasts to measure the lag time between what I\\'ve read [on social networks] and the news networks.\\n\\nWhat have you heard in the last several years about the situation for women in Iran? How have their lives changed or stayed the same?\\n\\nIt varies. Life can be very different for women who live in big metropolis and women who are in more remote parts of Iran. It has been a grand metamorphosis since 1979 when the regime started rolling back women\\'s rights and freedoms that had been extended under the Shah, prior to revolution.\\n\\nThe [religious] regime took a very macho approach to governance and saw rolling back the rights of women as a major priority. It instituted the veil and closed major [academic] fields to women, such as law and engineering.\\n\\nBut [the regime] never counted on the enormous backlash and not just from women who had been used to their freedoms. Challenges came from their \"own\" women too. They said, \"We are Muslim, we wear veils on heads and we want to participate. You told us we are brothers and sisters and as long as we are devout, there will be equal opportunity for everybody.\" The regime encouraged religious women who had never thought of themselves outside of the kitchen and home to come out and take part. And as a result, the women thought they were entitled. That was the part of the game the men had not foreseen.\\n\\nThese women helped cultivate a whole generation that previously was not politically active.\\n\\nAt this point, what\\'s your greatest hope for women in Iran?\\n\\nGreater solidarity and commitment to the cause of women.\\n\\nMuch of what we\\'re seeing right now--what we understand to be the huge social campaign against the rigging of the election--really came from the vast activities over the years of the feminist movement. Women were the ones who put together the infrastructure, who organized demonstrations and knew how to do this. The movement today owes a lot of its existence to the women\\'s movement and the infrastructure the women\\'s movement put in place.\\n\\nWhat can individuals around the world do to help show their support for more equality for women in Iran?\\n\\nA ribbon campaign or bumper stickers.\\n\\nAnd we need to keep this in focus. We are far more connected as human beings than we ever were. Our destinies are entwined with one another. The events of Sept. 11 and the rise of global terrorism is a sad reminder of that.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Move over, Feminist Ryan Gosling — there’s a new Tumblr battling sexism.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, 16 undergraduate students at Duke University launched Who Needs Feminism?, a campaign that encourages feminist and gender egalitarian discussion over social media.\\n\\nThe Tumblr features posters and statements from individuals explaining why feminism is important. Statements range from the personal to the global, including “I need feminism because it’s 2012 and only 3% of Fortune 500 CEOs are women,” and “I need feminism because I want to be respected, regardless of what I’m wearing.”\\n\\nWho Needs Feminism? began as the final project for the students’ seminar course, Women in the Public Sphere, the only guideline of which was to focus on social change.\\n\\n“We discussed this extensively and concluded that there is a disturbingly apathetic sentiment toward feminism, both on campus and on a broader societal scale,” says Amy Fryt, a senior at Duke’s Trinity College of Arts & Sciences. “We aim to challenge existing stereotypes surrounding feminists and assert the importance of feminism today.”\\n\\nAll 16 students on the Who Needs Feminism? team came from a variety of backgrounds, networks and social groups, which enabled them to connect with a large audience. Each student is female, but various male and transgender feminists have submitted to the Tumblr. One poster from a male Duke student reads, “I need feminism because too many people of my gender find sexual assault excusable on our campus.”\\n\\nThe Who Needs Feminism? team originally planned for the project to focus on Duke’s campus, but it quickly spread beyond that.\\n\\n“Students from other schools started reaching out to us to start Who Needs Feminism? campaigns at their own schools,” says Laura Kuhlman, a junior at Duke’s Trinity College of Arts & Sciences. “We’ve gotten posts from Duke alumni saying that they are proud of the university for taking this stance and posts from people who say that this campaign inspires them.”\\n\\nKuhlman says that they identified Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter as the main components of their social media strategy early on. “As college students, these are the platforms we use most frequently and we knew that we’d get an expansive reach. We initially thought Facebook would serve as our main source of promotion, but the Tumblr has really taken off,” she says.\\n\\nSince many users have uploaded and submitted their own photos, Kuhlman says that the Tumblr is a great way to encourage discussion without the moderation that the Facebook page requires.\\n\\nThe Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter accounts all interact to promote the general campaign. According to the Who Needs Feminism? team, the Facebook page received over 4,200 likes within 36 hours of the project’s launch. As of last night, their Tumblr had been accessed by people in 2,509 different cities, has earned 30,000 pageviews and had been viewed by almost 13,000 people.\\n\\nAt the time of this posting, the Facebook page has well over 5,500 likes and counting.',\n",

       "  'text': \"A FEW days ago, I visited the shiny headquarters of the Peterson Institute for International Economics on “think tank row” in Washington — basically, the locker room of the Team Globalization and Free Trade cheering squad.\\n\\nI was there to take part in a discussion of an old friend’s outstanding book on the subject, Steven R. Weisman’s “The Great Tradeoff: Confronting Moral Conflicts in the Era of Globalization.”\\n\\nAfter praising Steve’s book, I emphasized that I had paid attention in economics class and understood that globalization incontrovertibly has benefited not only the world but also the United States. That’s in part because trade permits Americans to buy goods at lower prices; the added purchasing power helps our economy expand faster.\\n\\nBut I soon pivoted to my experience working in the Obama administration on the auto rescue, an experience that had seared into me the sense that intermingled among the many winners from globalization were a substantial number of losers.\\n\\nSo far, so good. Then I went rogue and uttered two blasphemous words: “Ross Perot.” He had a point, I said heretically, when he campaigned in 1992 against the landmark North American Free Trade Agreement, saying that it would result in a “giant sucking sound” of jobs headed south to Mexico.\\n\\nA cool breeze drifted toward me.\\n\\nAs I looked out at my audience, I realized that the room was filled with winners — folks who, from all appearances, earned their livings from intellectual labor. Neither their jobs nor their wages were in jeopardy as countries ranging from Vietnam to Colombia became more competitive with us.\\n\\nLast year, according to the recent figures, our nation added 2.65 million new jobs. Just 30,000 of them were in manufacturing. So much for the widely trumpeted renaissance of Made in America.\\n\\nAt first glance, the automobile industry looks to be in better shape. From the depths of the crisis in 2009 through 2013, employment in the auto manufacturing sector in the United States rose by 23 percent, to 690,000 from 560,000.\\n\\nPercent change in the number of U.S. employees in each industry, 2000 to 2015.\\n\\nThat sounds pretty good, I said, except that employment in the Mexican auto sector rose to 589,000 from 368,000 during the same period, an increase of 60 percent. I’m happy that 221,000 more Mexicans got jobs, but let’s be honest: Absent open borders, many of those jobs would have been in America.\\n\\nThe wage picture looks even worse. Since January 2009, inflation-adjusted private sector wages across the economy have risen by 2.5 percent. In the fields of education, health and information, they are up by more than 3 percent. Meanwhile, in manufacturing, pay has fallen by 0.8 percent, and in the auto sector, by 12.7 percent.\\n\\n“Last point,” I said to the 100 or so guests: Average manufacturing compensation costs (includes wages and benefits) in the United States in 2012 were $35.67 per hour; in Mexico, they were $6.36 per hour. “And American auto executives will tell you that the productivity they get in Mexico is at least as good as what they get in the United States.”\\n\\nMy central argument was not that we should close our borders or retreat from the world; it was that we need to be sensitive to the losers and try to help. The point — well illustrated in Steve’s book — is that globalization is not only an economic matter but also a moral one.\\n\\nPresently, the institute’s blunt director, Adam Posen, used his final moments to shut me down, declaring that the “fetishization” of any industry was “immoral.” The problem of manufacturing is technology, he declared flatly.\\n\\nPercent change in wages for each industry, 2009 to 2015.\\n\\nBlaming technology is a common refrain from economists who hate the thought that globalization is not the world’s unambiguous salvation.\\n\\nSorry, Adam, I thought silently, having been afforded no time to respond. If technology were the source of manufacturing workers’ woes, productivity would be rising sharply, which it surely isn’t (notwithstanding claims by some economists that official statistics have been understating efficiency gains).\\n\\n“Don’t blame the robots for lost manufacturing jobs,” read the headline in a blog post last spring by two scholars at the venerable Brookings Institution.\\n\\nI have never forgotten a powerful article I read in Foreign Affairs in 2007 that called for huge tax redistribution, both as a moral matter and as a mechanism for ensuring political support for free trade. (The authors were hardly left-wing shills — one had served in the administration of President George W. Bush.)\\n\\nThat still sounds like the right idea to me.\\n\\nIt’s not only morally wrong to fail to help those on the losing end of globalization, but it will also end badly politically, as the ascendant candidacy of Donald J. Trump illustrates.\\n\\nSteven Rattner is a Wall Street executive and a contributing opinion writer.\\n\\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\\n\\nA version of this op-ed appears in print on January 26, 2016, on page A27 of the New York edition with the headline: Jobless in the Lion’s Den.

       "  'text': 'Last week, a 21-year-old soccer player named Harry Kane made a spectacular debut for England’s national team, scoring against Lithuania just 79 seconds after entering the game and then wheeling away with a look of joyous disbelief as a crowd of roughly 80,000 countrymen roared approval.\\n\\nMr. Kane’s unexpected emergence this season as the leading scorer for his club team, Tottenham Hotspur, has captivated fans — not least because he was born and raised a few miles from Tottenham’s north London stadium.\\n\\nIt has also made him a beacon of an anti-globalization groundswell that aims to restrict the participation of foreign players in England’s soccer leagues.\\n\\n“How many other Harry Kanes are there in the academies of English football who cannot get a first-team game?” Greg Dyke, chairman of English soccer’s governing body, the Football Association, wrote in an opinion article published by The Guardian. “We are simply not giving young domestic talent sufficient opportunities at the highest level of English football.”\\n\\nWhat would the standings look like in a hypothetical league in which a goal does not count unless it is scored by an English player?\\n\\nMr. Dyke put his concerns into broader and blunter form last week in announcing proposed limits on the participation of foreign players. The country’s top league, the Premier League, he declared, was headed toward being “owned by foreigners, managed by foreigners and played by foreigners.”\\n\\nEconomists have long held up soccer — which has become one of the most globalized markets for skilled labor — as a shining example of the benefits of open borders. The Premier League now draws capital and labor from around the world, and produces a spectacle consumed around the world. That’s why Tottenham’s jerseys feature the logo of AIA, an Asian-based insurance company that doesn’t even have offices in England. And economists say that’s good for the players, their countries — and for England.\\n\\nAs in the United States, however, this expert consensus has largely failed to shift public opinion. The recruitment of skilled foreigners to take jobs once held by English players feeds into deep anxieties about the inflow of immigrants in a country that has never seen itself as a melting pot. A recent Ipsos MORI poll found that 45 percent of Britons regard immigration as the top issue facing the country ahead of national elections in May.\\n\\nThe basic argument is straightforward. There are only 500 player jobs in the Premier League — 20 teams, each with 25 players. Two decades ago, Englishmen held about 69 percent of those jobs. Last season, they held 37 percent, according to data compiled by CIES Football Observatory. By contrast, 61 percent of players in the Spanish league were Spanish; 59 percent of players in the German league were German.\\n\\nThe Championship, the second tier of English soccer, has also become notably less English. English players accounted for less than half of the total minutes played during the early months of the current season, the BBC calculated.\\n\\nAnd Mr. Dyke and his supporters say England’s national team is struggling because fewer players have the chance to learn their trade at the highest levels. Tottenham loaned Mr. Kane to four teams between 2011 and 2013 while employing a series of expensive imports in the job he now holds. Mr. Dyke says other talented English players may similarly be languishing in reserve.\\n\\nMr. Dyke has convinced the government to impose new limits on the supply of foreign players, by making it harder to get work permits. He also wants to limit demand for them, by persuading teams to reserve more of their 25 roster slots for homegrown players.\\n\\nThe effort is a version of what economists call “import substitution” — raising barriers at the border to encourage the development of domestic industry. It is a strategy developing nations have used with success — including, once upon a time, Britain and the United States, and, more recently, China.\\n\\nBut England is not developing a new industry. Soccer was invented there. And there are some important reasons to doubt the gut-feeling argument that foreign players are bad for the English game. The league itself is hugely profitable, and much of that money arrives in England from other countries. Rich foreigners buy teams. Companies buy sponsorships. Fans buy jerseys.\\n\\n“The Premier League has become the most successful product in sporting history,” said Simon Kuper, co-author of “Soccernomics,” a 2014 book that uses data to examine the game’s development. And the English league has become the world’s most popular, outstripping leagues in Spain and Germany and Italy, in large part because it has become the most global.\\n\\nThe league’s success means that the remaining English players earn much more than their predecessors — so much more that English players, in aggregate, are almost certainly taking home more money. The average salary this season is 2.3 million pounds (about $3.4 million), according to a Daily Mail survey. In 1992-93, the first season of the current league structure, the average was just 140,000 pounds (about $208,000), after adjusting for inflation.\\n\\nThe Premier League also makes direct payments to England’s minor leagues. It buys players from minor league teams. And every year, three teams from the second division are promoted to the Premier League, while three Premier League teams move down. Since 1992, 46 different teams have enjoyed at least one season of windfall Premier League profits.\\n\\nPlayers in the second flight now earn 486,000 pounds on average (about $721,000) — or more than three times as much, after inflation, as top-flight players two decades ago.\\n\\nMr. Kane and his peers, in other words, are beneficiaries of globalization.\\n\\nThe fans arguably are beneficiaries, too. They get to watch better players and better games, and their hometown teams are among the giants of global soccer. Manchester citizens may take pride in the success of Manchester United or Manchester City, even if few of the teams’ players have been English in recent years.\\n\\nThe globalization of soccer began to accelerate in 1995 when a Belgian player, Jean-Marc Bosman, convinced the European Court of Justice that European Union nations could not impose limits on the employment of European Union soccer players.\\n\\nThe effect was much broader. The year before the ruling, just 6 percent of the players in top European leagues came from outside Europe. Four years later, the share had climbed to 28 percent, according to a 2014 analysis by Chrysovalantis Vasilakis, an economist at the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium.\\n\\nMr. Vasilakis and other economists see evidence that globalization has increased the competitive balance of international competitions like the World Cup, as players from smaller and less affluent countries, such as Ghana and Uruguay, have more opportunities at the game’s highest levels. That suggests England and other traditional powers are losing ground, in relative terms, because they now face stiffer competition.\\n\\nBut it’s hard to see the evidence in the performance of England’s national team. During the Premier League era, the team has held a relatively steady position in FIFA’s ranking of national teams, with an average ranking of 10th. England’s performance at the World Cup has also remained relatively constant, although fans inevitably pine for a repeat of 1966, when England hosted and won the Cup.\\n\\nCharles Kenny, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, notes that English players also benefit from the improved competition in the Premier League.\\n\\nAnd Mr. Kenny, who is English, says he has no appetite for stepping on the prospects of other nations. “Does England really want to stay ahead in the global game by keeping other national teams down?” he said. “That seems an awfully colonial attitude.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'Caviar has lost its national identity.\\n\\nOver the years, caviar-producing wild sturgeon in the Caspian Sea have been poached, smuggled and overfished to the brink of extinction. Sturgeon fishing fell under a series of strict international quotas and in 2008 was subjected to a global ban by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. The only caviar on the market since then comes from tame varieties farmed in concrete basins and cages. The result is a global free-for-all in which caviar’s country of origin has no meaning, and only the best eggs win.\\n\\n“Once upon a time, great caviar meant the Caspian,” says Armen Petrossian, owner of the Petrossian restaurant and boutique in the Seventh Arrondissement in Paris. Now, he says, “geography and nationality do not count.” Yet business is so good that sturgeon are raised on about 90 farms in more than 20 countries, in places as varied as Israel, the United States, China, Uruguay and just about every country in Europe.\\n\\nTo prove that caviar is stateless, Petrossian arranged an ambitious tasting for T and another writer — the French food author Jean-Claude Ribaut — over lunch. Twelve different caviars on four silver ice stands were laid out. Each stand held three grades — from the lowly “royal” to the midgrade “imperial” and the superior “special reserve” — of each species. He told his guests to try one at a time in the order he chose. Using a small mother-of-pearl spoon for each variety, they loaded gobs of caviar onto blinis and washed them down with vintage Deutz Champagne served in tall, narrow flutes. By the second round, they were spooning the caviar like jam into their mouths.\\n\\nPetrossian is probably the best-known caviar merchant in the world. His father and uncle opened the Paris boutique 94 years ago. But at the tasting, when asked the origin of the caviars, he knew only some of them. He had to peek at the labels glued to the bottom of the tins to identify the rest. The Beluga was Bulgarian, he said; the Baeri French; the Osetra Italian. Transmontanus, which comes from white sturgeon, is his best-selling caviar, produced in the tiny town of Elverta in the Sacramento Valley in California. “The only guide we use to judge quality is our senses,” Petrossian says. “Only taste, smell, color, brilliance and texture of each species count.”\\n\\nThe search for the best caviar requires dogged investigation and years of experience. The same farm can produce caviar of different qualities, depending on variables like the temperature and purity of the water and the season of the year. A caviar that tastes like earth comes from sturgeon raised in water that isn’t crystal clear, for example. Sturgeon eggs from Bulgaria are best in the spring, when the mountain air and water is still cold. Petrossian likens the selection task to choosing gemstones. “You buy a diamond because of its beauty, not the country where it was mined.”\\n\\nAt Kaviari, a Paris-based wholesale supplier to hotels, restaurants and fine gourmet shops, the approach is more single-minded. There is no beautiful restaurant, only an antiseptic, white-walled, refrigerated room for serious tastings with a stainless steel table and no place to sit. (Since this is France, Champagne is served, even in the morning).\\n\\nEven starred chefs like Yannick Alléno, Guy Savoy and Jean-François Piège are required to wear plasticized paper coats, hairnets and shoe coverings when they visit. They come to taste and choose their caviar from Bruno Higos, a master taster with more than three decades’ experience. One morning, Higos opened four 1.8-kilo tins of caviar for an informal tasting: a Transmontanus and a Baeri from Italy, an Osetra from Bulgaria and a Schrenki from China.\\n\\nCaviar has long stood for seductive luxury. So Kaviari, Petrossian and other caviar dealers have come up with creative ways to promote their products now that they can no longer sell the luscious caviar fished from the Iranian and Russian borders of the Caspian Sea.\\n\\nKaviari offers individual caviar servings in a slim “line” of 15 grams of caviar and a plastic spoon in a narrow, colorful tin that starts at 25 euros. Bars serve it along with a glass of Champagne or a shot of vodka; private companies can order personalized versions of it for special events like New Year’s Eve.\\n\\nPetrossian, meanwhile, has begun processing and marketing tiny black lobster eggs under the name “Bijou de la Mer” — jewel of the sea. The eggs release the taste of iodine and salt when their hard skins are crushed between the teeth. “Papierusse,” a thin sheet of vacuum-packed pressed caviar, and its tinned, pressed caviar with the consistency of thick jam, work well with soft-boiled eggs, boiled baby potatoes or in a caviar sandwich. Petrossian also markets a host of unrelated products under the label: pomegranate juice, smoked scallops, royal crab claws, herbal teas, borscht, vodka and even chocolates, honey, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Its pièce de resistance this season is an artisan-crafted, limited-edition metal tin that measures 18 inches in diameter and resembles an oversize hat box. It is large and sturdy enough to be used as a coffee table. It costs 1,000 euros even when empty; if filled to the brim with caviar, smoked fish, vodka and other delicacies, the price can rise to 10,000.\\n\\nDespite merchants’ clever attempts to deflect attention from caviar’s origins, there are ways to identify and rank caviar by region and country. France, where sturgeon are farmed in manmade basins in the Sologne, Aquitaine and Charente regions, was a pioneer in sturgeon farming. But it is not making the best caviar. That’s because French farmers raise mostly Baeri — a small sturgeon species which produces small eggs — to be farmed. The eggs can lack firmness and the taste does not linger long on the palate.\\n\\nChina, meanwhile, is moving forward rapidly in caviar farming, and eventually could come to dominate it, thanks in part to freshwater Lake Hangzhou. The water of this 221-square-mile lake is pure, its currents strong. Sturgeon are housed in huge cages that can be raised and lowered to a depth of 164 feet to keep them cold. “It’s a great beginning, and it’s approaching what you used to find in the Osetra or the Caspian,” says Raphaël Bouchez, Kaviari’s president.\\n\\nThe unknown is whether sturgeon, which take 10 or more years to mature, will ever again be fished from the Caspian. But one can dream. Indeed, the Chinese Schrenki looks exactly like the translucent golden-grey Osetra of the deep waters of the Caspian. The firm, fatty texture of the eggs is the same. Its taste is nutty and stays long on the tongue. Perhaps because it is also so beautiful, it is the choice of France’s great chefs. But Higos, the taster at Kaviari, still remembers fine Iranian Beluga and Osetra from the days when he went to Iran to buy. “When the first box arrived, I said to myself, ‘Ah, Iran,’” Higos says of the Schrenki. “Alas, it’s not the taste of the golden caviar of the Caspian. I was very disappointed.”\\n\\nAdditional reporting by Assia Labbas.',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON — Adm. James G. Stavridis, who stepped down this month as NATO’s supreme commander, has been at war in two wars — overseeing the alliance’s role in the enduring mission in Afghanistan as well as the shorter combat air campaign over Libya.\\n\\nCombined with his tenure before NATO — he was the top officer at the military’s Southern Command, for a total of seven years in a senior four-star billet — Admiral Stavridis had been the longest-serving global combatant commander in the American military.\\n\\nAs he rose through the ranks of command over a 37-year career in uniform, Admiral Stavridis also came to be recognized as one of the military’s most prolific authors on strategy, operations and tactics. Today, though, ask what worries him most, and he answers in a single word: convergence.\\n\\nThat is the new term of choice in national security circles for the coming together of previously unrelated adversaries, who not only might combine in operations, but also share resources, know-how, weapons and technology and personnel.\\n\\n“This is really the dark end of the spectrum of globalization as you assess rising national security risks,” Admiral Stavridis said in an interview. “It is something I worry about enormously.”\\n\\nWhat might convergence look like?\\n\\nDrug cartels along America’s southern border, whose smuggling operations move contraband and people into the United States, might come to make common cause with terrorist or militant organizations to bring in weapons or bomber makers.\\n\\n“I think that’s a very possible and very dangerous business model, and you have to prevent narco-businessmen crossing those streams with the terrorists,” Admiral Stavridis said.\\n\\n“What the narco-confederacies offer are routes, the trafficking capabilities — moving matériel and people,” he added. “If you can move 10 tons of cocaine into the U.S. in a small, semi-submersible vessel, how hard do you think it would be to move a weapon of mass destruction?”\\n\\nAlthough it had long been assumed that drug traffickers would not want to adopt political or militant activities for fear of bringing down even harsher American might to suppress their for-profit operations, Admiral Stavridis said that “for the right level of inducement — for the right amount of money — it could happen.”\\n\\nHe said there were signs already of operatives “with a foot in both camps, including Hezbollah.”\\n\\nFor example, American law enforcement officials have said they thwarted an Iranian-backed plot in 2011 to co-opt members of a Mexican drug gang to kill the Saudi ambassador to Washington. And the Taliban underwrite their operations in Afghanistan via the poppy trade.\\n\\nAdmiral Stavridis also sketched a scenario in which a country like North Korea, seeking to attack the United States or its allies without the clear and obvious attribution of a missile launch, might contract with a smuggling ring to move a weapon into a major port somewhere in the world.\\n\\nThose assessments on future national security risks will be carried by Admiral Stavridis to his next job, in academia, as dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.\\n\\nAssessing other significant transformations to the modern way of war, Admiral Stavridis underscored the sea change in the amount and movement of information on the battlefield.\\n\\n“My smartphone has more communications capability, and can manage more information than the $500 million destroyer I first sailed in 1977,” he said. “And that’s by orders of magnitude.”\\n\\nHe gave the military only a “B+” grade for its abilities to leverage the revolution of information, including the emergence of social networks, in reshaping the ways local populations interact among themselves and with their governments.\\n\\nAlso worrisome, he said, is how adversaries show great agility in using information against the United States and its allies. The future of security for the United States is to build up its own physical networks of alliances, coalitions and partnerships, he said.\\n\\n“The 20th century was all about building walls: The Maginot Line, the Siegfried Line, the Iron Curtain, the Bamboo Curtain and the Berlin Wall — we built walls everywhere,” Admiral Stavridis said. “How did that work for us? Sixty million dead in two world wars, a continent destroyed in Europe and much of Asia destroyed, as well.”\\n\\nFor the 21st century, he said, “We cannot create security with walls. You have to build bridges. It will be all about alliances and coalitions. And the military has to build bridges to the civilian sectors to create security.\\n\\n“We will still need our guns,” he concluded. “There are times we have to apply lethal force. Soft power alone is like no power. But combining soft and hard power is smart power.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'After a recent Economix post (as part of the election-year project called The Agenda) explaining that many economists see globalization as a major cause of the income slowdown in this country, Edward Alden of the Council on Foreign Relations noted on Twitter that this view was a new one. For years, economists argued that increased global trade did not have a large effect on wages or employment in the United States. The editors invited Mr. Alden — the director of the Renewing America initiative at the council, who previously helped run a council task force on trade and investment policy – to send along a more detailed version of his point.\\n\\nFor decades, economists resisted the conclusion that trade – for all of its many benefits — has also played a significant role in job loss and the stagnation of middle-class incomes in the United States. As recently as 2008, for instance, Robert Lawrence of Harvard, one of the country’s most respected trade experts, concluded that trade explained only a small share of growing income inequality and labor market displacement in the United States.\\n\\nRather than focusing on trade, economists argued that other factors – especially “skill-biased technical change,” technological innovation that puts an added premium on skilled workers – played the biggest role in holding down middle-class wages. But now economists are beginning to change their minds. Responding to The Times’s recent survey about the causes of income stagnation, many top economists have cited globalization as a leading cause.\\n\\nWhile the evidence is still not conclusive, it is pretty strong. Trade’s effect on jobs and income, which was probably modest through the 1990’s, now seems to be growing much larger. Among the recent studies:\\n\\n• In “The Evolving Structure of the American Economy and the Employment Challenge,” the Nobel-winning economist Michael Spence looked at job growth from 1990 to 2008 in sectors of the United States economy. He found almost no net job growth in sectors, like manufacturing, in which global trade played a large role. Nearly all of the net gains occurred in sectors in which trade plays a minor role. Government and health care, in which trade plays almost no role, accounted for more than 40 percent of all new jobs.\\n\\n• David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon Hanson looked at regions in the United States where companies are competing most directly with China. From 1990 to 2007, they found that regions that faced growing exposure to Chinese competition had higher unemployment, lower labor-force participation and lower wages than might otherwise be expected. And the effects grew over that period. In 1991, just 2.9 percent of United States manufacturing imports came from low-wage countries; by 2007, that had risen to nearly 12 percent, mostly from China.\\n\\n• In the Council on Foreign Relations Task Force on U.S. Trade and Investment Policy, my colleague Matthew Slaughter looked at employment at multinational companies with headquarters in the United States, companies that account for roughly 60 percent of American exports and imports. From 1989 to 1999, those companies created 4.4 million jobs in the United States and 2.7 million jobs at their foreign affiliates overseas. From 1999 to 2009, however, those same companies eliminated a net of nearly 3 million jobs in the United States while adding another 2.4 million jobs abroad.\\n\\nThe usual rebuttal to these findings is to argue that they stem mostly from manufacturing. And manufacturing, the argument goes, is facing a long-run, secular decline in employment that is largely technology-driven, not unlike the story of agriculture in the 20th century. The job losses in manufacturing may seem as if they have been caused by trade, according to this view, but they have actually been caused by technological change.\\n\\nThrough the 1990s, that story was largely plausible. But over the last decade it is not. Manufacturing output in the United States is no longer growing as rapidly as it once was (and as you would expect if technology had simply been replacing workers in factories). Real manufacturing output grew just 15 percent in the 2000s, compared with more than 35 percent in each of the 1970s and 1980s and more than 50 percent in the 1990s. And one sector where the statistics are of dubious meaning — computers and electronics – accounts for almost all of the recent gains. In 13 of 19 manufacturing sectors, real output declined over the last decade, in some industries quite sharply. There is no question that over the last decade United States manufacturing has declined, taking away jobs and driving down wages for those who are still employed. Robert Atkinson and colleagues have a useful paper on this topic, showing that the loss of more than five million jobs in manufacturing in a decade was not primarily a technology and productivity story.\\n\\nThe real-world evidence makes it surprising that it has taken economists so long to catch on. The recent strike in Joliet, Ill., at Caterpillar – a true global company — ended with union workers being forced to accept an agreement that includes a six-year wage freeze, even as the company is earning record profits. Elsewhere, two-tier agreements, in which new hires earn wages and benefits roughly half as large as those in the old union contracts, have become standard in many of the manufacturing industries that remain in the United States.\\n\\nOne reason that economists may be uncomfortable talking about trade’s impact on jobs and wages may be concern that it could set off protectionist responses. And economists are right that expanded trade has certainly been good for the United States. It has brought us better and cheaper consumer goods, opened new export markets, lifted up many poor countries and strengthened American alliances around the world.\\n\\nBut I think the fear of protectionism is overblown. One unexpected feature of the great recession was how little protectionism it led to, especially in the advanced economies. The lesson of the Great Depression – that protectionism is counterproductive – seems to have been learned.\\n\\nInstead, the evidence should produce some soul-searching about the causes of this country’s declining competitiveness. The list is discouragingly long: crumbling infrastructure, inadequate educational performance, stifling regulation and a cumbersome tax system. But it might not take that much to tip the scales in favor of the United States. The Boston Consulting Group, which has looked at the slight uptick in the nation’s manufacturing employment over the last two years, argues that rising wages in China, high transportation costs and falling United States energy costs should bring more manufacturing back home.\\n\\nWith the rapid growth of middle classes abroad, trade should be an opportunity for the United States to sell into growing markets, increasing opportunities and wages for many Americans here at home. But over the last decade, that has not been the story.',\n",

Factory workers who have seen their jobs exported to countries with cheaper laborers could have told them that, you say? But this is an important sea change, Chrystia Freeland writes in her latest Page Two column. Referring to a recent paper by David H. Autor, David Dorn and Gordon H. Hanson, she says, we are not talking about protectionists.\\n\\nDrawing on detailed data from local labor markets in the United States, the authors of the ‘‘The China Syndrome’’ argue that globalization, and in particular trade with China, is having a huge impact on blue-collar U.S. workers: ‘‘Conservatively, it explains one-quarter of the contemporaneous aggregate decline in U.S. manufacturing employment.’’\\n\\nThe deleterious effects go beyond those workers who lose their jobs. In communities hit by the China syndrome, wages fall — particularly, it turns out, outside the manufacturing sector — and some people stop looking for work. The result is ‘‘a steep drop in the average earnings of households.’’ Uncle Sam gets hit, too, especially in the form of increased disability payouts.\\n\\nChrystia says that Europe, and especially Germany, can teach the Americans a thing or two: “Germany has turned the China Syndrome to the benefit of both its chief executives and its blue-collar workers.”\\n\\nDo you agree? Have German workers fared better than their American counterparts in the age of globalization? What about other European workers? And what will austere budgets and cuts in the social welfare net mean for European workers going forward? Is America’s problem, American policies rather than China?

Independent reporters have been filing their own articles and prepping radio broadcasts. One of the best all-purpose sites with updates from the streets is being hosted by Indymedia Pittsburgh. Local protest organizers have also circulated an annotated online map of sites for possible direct action on Thursday and Friday. Ordinary citizens have been documenting the truly huge police build-up and security preparations. Protesters have posted a live feed of the city’s police scanner to track certain communications. Protesters have also pulled together a number of short videos highlighting their gripes with the global financial system; some bring a touch of humor, others, less so.\\n\\nThere is the standard footage and interviews from marches, put together by groups on their websites and personal blogs. Probably the best roundup video concerning the types of harassment that protesters have encountered was produced by Flux Rostrum, an activist and videographer who has attended and shot many of the protests.\\n\\nRallying the faithful, the acclaimed historian and Boston University political science professor Howard Zinn also sent along a short video. Professor Zinn has spoken at many anti-globalization rallies in the past, but was not able to attend this time because of health problems.\\n\\nSome of the multimedia activity has been aimed at documenting abuses and potentially preparing for later legal action.\\n\\nIn Pittsburgh, the American Civil Liberties Union has also been keeping a running report of complaints from protest groups about police harassment, illegal seizures and preemptive arrests. In the same vein, protest groups have interviewed people from the scene where organizers claim to have been harassed, and have set up their own legal help hotline.\\n\\nOne cautionary video that has attracted a lot of attention is from the last G-20 meeting, which was held in London in April. It focuses on Ian Tomilson, who was apparently diverted on his way home from work when he wound up being “kettled,” or cordoned off, by police. As Mr. Tomlinson walked away from the officer with his hands in his pockets, the officer struck his leg with a baton and shoved him to the ground. Mr. Tomlinson collapsed and died moments later. The fallout and investigation of that incident has been reported extensively by The New York Times’s London-based correspondent Sarah Lyall and on The Lede blog by Robert Mackey.',\n",

Feminism is back on the rise, and it’s all thanks to the internet. Social media lets women share their experiences faster and wider than ever, and that is fuelling a new, highly personal mass movement.\\n\\nTake the ultra-successful Everyday Sexism project, which retweets women’s nasty experiences at the hands of sweaty human octopi. It really is grim reading. They’ve got 90,000 followers on Twitter, although their reach goes way further. Here’s a random example: “I had a stranger slide their hand up between my legs while I was ordering drinks at a bar.” If that happened 18 months ago, the victim would suffer alone. Now she can reach an audience equal to Nuts and Zoo magazines’ readerships combined.\\n\\nGiven we’re talking about a mix of social media and radical politics, things are inevitably moving fastest among students. In the last year, feminist societies have popped up at universities everywhere, including Durham, Liverpool and Kings College London. When I was at university four years ago, we published a reprehensible Page 3 feature on our tabloid website called Tab Totty. We had a Cambridge student posing awkwardly on a punt wearing a pink bikini and the kind of Perspex heels that David Cameron wants to make you opt-in to see. It's offline now, sorry. The shoot attracted the wrath of about three angry feminists.\\n\\nIf someone brought out Tab Totty today, they would be abused in lectures, and their inboxes and message feeds would overflow with messages from people they will never meet telling them just how “vile” (the angry adjective du jour) they are. If you upset a feminist now, you better be prepared for abuse from a hundred others.\\n\\nEarlier this year, a campaign where students were photographed holding placards explaining “why I need feminism” was posted endlessly on Facebook. It’s simple, picture-based storytelling, and marketing professionals are already using it as a case study. In a world without Facebook, that idea would live and die in a few radical magazines. Now, it gets shared and imitated round the world.\\n\\nThe fit is obvious – social media is all about sharing your personal experience. And so too is this contemporary brand of feminism. It’s an aggregation of nasty experiences, annoyances and personal justifications. That stuff might be seriously individualistic, but it’s something everyone can get on board with. In fact, it is a method of political symbolism normally better used by the Right: people, stories and faces, that’s the stuff that arouses human emotion, not tiresome theoretical constructions.\\n\\nThe new feminism is hardly the March on Washington, but it is the only political movement – Jihadists aside – using the Internet effectively. Today’s feminists have a formula politicians and marketers crave: how to harness technology and individualism to build a mass movement people actually care about.\\n\\nSo get used to hearing about the patriarchy, because the online surge is going to mean more feminists everywhere: in the workplace, on the TV, perhaps even in your living room.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'An old canard about feminists is that, in addition to being hirsute bra-burners, we want to turn all women into “victims” – and thanks to “Women Against Feminism”, this particular accusation has gained some moderately mainstream traction in recent weeks.\\n\\nBut feminism doesn’t make women victims. Sexism does.\\n\\nThat inconvenient truth hasn’t stopped conservatives and anti-feminists from using this supposed victimization to bash a movement that won women the rights to vote, have credit cards, not be legally raped by their husbands, use birth control and generally be considered people instead of property, among other things.\\n\\nAdmittedly, to those unfamiliar with stereotypes of the women’s movement, the #WomenAgainstFeminism meme may look more like a parody than anything of serious concern. Many of its participants show a baffling level of ignorance about what feminism actually is – signs reading “I don’t need feminism because my boyfriend treats me right” or “I like men looking at me” are cringe-inducing, for instance. And I’m skeptical of how many new “women’s” Twitter accounts suddenly popped up in the days surrounding the meme’s creation.\\n\\nBut all the cringing and skepticism in the world hasn’t stopped the idea of “Women Against Feminism” from being taken seriously by at least some in the media.\\n\\nThe BBC kicked off a conversation about the “movement” by asking, “Has feminism become unnecessary and irrelevant?” The expected conservative hacks have come out, with the National Review Online bashing the “hostile” feminist responses and Rush Limbaugh saying “pictures of these babes” are “really, really great to see”. And Cathy Young wrote at Time about the multiple disavowals of feminism that cited “I am not a victim” and called the characterization of the movement as victimizing a “fair description”.\\n\\nBut denying that women are a victimized class is simply wrong. What else would you call a segment of the population who are systematically discriminated against in school, work and politics? How would you describe a population whose bodies are objectified to the point of dehumanization? Women are harassed, attacked and sexually assaulted with alarming regularity in America and around the world, and now even more of them live in states where, if pregnant, they can be refused medical attention or arrested for refusing C-sections.\\n\\nPeople who are on the shit end of oppression are oppressed. Accurately describing this is not a matter of politics, but of truth.\\n\\nBut because we live in a culture that values independence and strength and negates the agency of victims – wrongly conflating victimhood with weakness instead of directing our opprobrium at those who victimize – the label will automatically have detractors. No one likes to be a victim, let alone conceive of themselves that way (no matter what George Will believes). But when women refuse to admit to ourselves that we’re systematically victimized, we give fuel to those on the political right who claim – despite all evidence to the contrary – that women are doing just fine.\\n\\nActually, the conservative rhetoric of late around rolling back women’s rights is mostly about women’s “independence”: we don’t need coverage for birth control, we choose the pay gap, we’re too strong for legal protections. (Of course this interest in women’s agency disappears when they’re discussing abortion, of which women are supposedly perpetual victims and in need of the most condescending laws on the books.)\\n\\nIf we’re unwilling to accept women’s factual status as victims in society, it makes it that much harder for society to accept those who hurt women as victimizers.\\n\\nThere’s a reason men like ESPN’s now temporarily-suspended Stephen A Smith say that women who are beaten need to “do your part” and avoid “elements of provocation”. As anti-violence educator and filmmaker Byron Hurt explained in Ebony, it’s because “[t]his deflection never fails. Men create excuses for their abusive behavior and deny women’s victimhood.”\\n\\nClearly there are women – for a myriad of reasons – who don’t want to identify as victims or support the idea that women are victimized. Maybe there are even a lucky few who have never experienced discrimination. But as a college professor once told me, the existence of a few women who have lived their lives under an umbrella of privilege does not mean that it’s not raining on the rest of us.\\n\\nNaming what is happening to women – that we are being oppressed, held back, and yes, victimized – is not weakness. It takes strength to tell uncomfortable truths.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Posted by Suzi Parker on February 8, 2013 at 9:01 am\\n\\n“Feminism” is not a dirty word.\\n\\nBut some people think it is. A staffer at Beliefnet, a spirituality, inspiration and emotional wellness Web site, told Minnesota playwright Kristine Holmgren that readers had issues with the word “feminism.”\\n\\nHolmgren, who planned to use in the word in the title of her new blog for the site, shared an email from Beliefnet’s marketing and business analyst Sharon Kirk with media writer Jim Romensko on his Web site.\\n\\n“\\xadI would suggest changing the tag line or deleting all together as I’m concerned about the negative connotation that our readers may associate with the word feminism,” the email read. “In addition, we’ll want this blog to focus more on Christianity/spirituality as opposed to issues related to feminism. What do you think of simply ‘Sweet Truths with Kristine Holmgren’?”\\n\\nHolmgren, who is also a Presbyterian pastor, told Kirk, “Please phone me.” In their ensuing discussion, Holmgren says, she asked whether Kirk was troubled by the word “feminist.” No, Kirk reportedly answered, but the Web site’s readers were. Holgren then told the Web site she didn’t want to write for it.\\n\\nHave conservatives so corrupted the word “feminist” that is now tainted like the word like “liberal” or “environmentalist”? The fact that this is even in the realm of discussion in 2013 makes my head ache terribly — and makes me angry.\\n\\nFeminism, in its simplest definition, means women – and men who align with that philosophy – who want equal rights for women. Who believe women should have equal pay, legal, voting, education and reproductive rights and protection from domestic violence, sexual assault and harassment. And no, you don’t have be a militant and burn your bra to be a feminist. But you can if you want to.\\n\\nWhen I was growing up, my mother, who was of the generation where women married after high school, took their husband’s name and had babies, always told me that I could do anything a boy could do. I sometimes doubted that in the 1970s South, when girls were still dressing in frills to attend cotillion and enter beauty pageants. But I gave it my best shot. I skateboarded, popped wheelies on my bike and played baseball – not softball – with the neighborhood boys. And like the boys, I suffered skinned knees and bruised arms (mine were visible when I wore my sundresses). I felt equal, if not at times better, than they were.\\n\\nSome 20-something, millennial women say that feminism has corrupted their femininity and their wish to stay at home and raise children. Not at all. Feminism is about the opportunity for a woman to choose whatever path in her life she wants, but, also to have the same rights as her male counterparts, whether in the boardroom or the bedroom. If men feel intimidated by this modernity, it’s their problem.\\n\\nThe tainting of the word “feminism” has a lot to do with Rush Limbaugh, who has made it his mission for the last 20 years to try and put women in their proper place. In the early 1990s, he repeatedly used the term “feminazi,” a slur to describe a dozen or so women – Gloria Steinem, Anita Hill and Susan Sarandon – whom he found repulsive for their beliefs. Limbaugh later adopted the term to describe any woman who supported abortion rights or, essentially, who he didn’t like.\\n\\nNot many years ago, the term “queer” was used as anti-gay hate speech. But many millennials have embraced that word, and added “Q” to LGBT to break down boundaries. Popular television shows such as “Queer Eye” and “Queer Folk” have even adopted the term in a positive way.\\n\\nKudos to Holmgren for standing her ground on “feminism.” In the ongoing war on women in this country and around the world, it’s time to take back the word proudly.\\n\\nSuzi Parker is an Arkansas-based political and cultural journalist and author of “Sex in the South: Unbuckling the Bible Belt.” Follow her on Twitter at @SuziParker',\n",

       "  'text': 'SANTA CRUZ, Bolivia— Pope Francis issued a broadside against the global economic system, denouncing a structure based on worship of money, blaming it for inequality, military conflict and environmental degradation.\\n\\nSpeaking Thursday in a bastion of the antiglobalization movement, the pontiff called for a “globalization of hope” that would guarantee the needs of every person. He urged those who are excluded themselves to rise up to realize that hope.\\n\\nPope Francis illustrated the world’s problems in personal terms, invoking the “endangered peasant, the poor laborer, the downtrodden native, the homeless family, the persecuted migrant, the unemployed young person, the exploited child...”\\n\\nSuch cases are not isolated issues but casualties of a system that has “imposed the mentality of profit at any price, with no concern for social exclusion or the destruction of nature,” he told a group of several thousand grass-roots social activists from Latin America and around the world, while sitting alongside Bolivian President Evo Morales.\\n\\nMoments before, Mr. Morales recounted his country’s struggle with the International Monetary Fund and the “democratic revolution” that Greek voters had recently initiated by rejecting the terms of their European creditors.\\n\\n“In Bolivia, the gringos no longer rule, the Indians do,” Mr. Morales said, wearing a jacket with the image of the Argentine revolutionary Che Guevara.\\n\\nThe pontiff’s criticism—an indirect reproach of the West and the U.S., which he will tour later this year—was the most directly political so far on his weeklong visit to South America, which started on Sunday in Ecuador and will also take him to Paraguay beginning on Friday.\\n\\nIt was the second such meeting co-sponsored by the Vatican in which Pope Francis addressed his signature concerns for social and economic justice.\\n\\nThousands of people lined the nearly mile-long stretch of road leading up to the meeting place, including Morales supporters.\\n\\n“The pope is a Jesuit so he knows the struggle of the indigenous,” said Juan Antonio Cabrera, who came from the pope’s native Argentina. “He’s lived and worked with them. He’s spreading the same message as Jesus did.”\\n\\nOthers were critical of Mr. Morales, who has ruled Bolivia for a decade.\\n\\n“The government must be nervous that the pope may find out what’s really going on here,” said an indigenous leader, Adolfo Chávez, who raised concerns about a deadly state crackdown in 2011 on groups protesting a new highway cutting through pristine indigenous park land.\\n\\nIn his speech, Pope Francis blamed many of the global system’s ills on “corporations, loan agencies, certain ‘free trade’ treaties, and the imposition of measures of ‘austerity’ which always tighten the belt of workers and the poor.”\\n\\nIn a country that has broken most ties with U.S. anti-drug efforts, the pope denounced what he characterized as burdensome and counterproductive measures imposed on poorer countries “under the noble guise of battling corruption, the narcotics trade and terrorism.”\\n\\nThe pope urged his audience to “say ‘no’ to an economy of exclusion and inequality” in favor of an “economy of Christian inspiration,” which would guarantee everyone not only the basics of land, housing and employment, but also “access to education, health care, new technologies, artistic and cultural manifestations, communications, sports and recreation.”\\n\\nPope Francis termed his goal the “globalization of hope, a hope which springs up from peoples and takes root among the poor, and must replace the globalization of exclusion and indifference.”\\n\\nThat goal, the pope said, “is no utopia or Chimera. It is an extremely realistic prospect. We can achieve it.” He urged his audience of farmers, artisans, rag-pickers and un-unionized workers to join “in the great processes of change” through political participation and forms of “communitarian production” such as workers’ cooperatives.\\n\\n“I am with you,” the pope told the crowd.\\n\\nPope Francis acknowledged that the Catholic Church he leads has a mixed record as force for social liberation, particularly in Latin America, whose conquest by European colonists was justified in the name of spreading Christianity.\\n\\n“I humbly ask forgiveness, not only for the offenses of the church herself, but also for crimes committed against the native peoples during the so-called conquest of America,” the pope said, though he noted the good works of many missionaries that he said made the church “part of the identity of the peoples of Latin America.”\\n\\nOn Wednesday evening in Bolivia’s capital of La Paz, Mr. Morales made an especially provocative gesture when he gave the pope a wooden crucifix that incorporated the communist symbol of the hammer and sickle, and draped him with two medallions, one of which also bore the former Soviet image.\\n\\nA Vatican spokesman said the crucifix was designed by the late Rev. Luis Espinal, an activist Jesuit priest killed by paramilitary forces in 1980, when Bolivia was under a dictatorship.\\n\\nThe hammer-and-sickle medallion is an honorary decoration established by the Bolivian government in honor of Father Espinal, the spokesman said.\\n\\nPope Francis paused briefly to pray at Father Espinal’s murder site on Wednesday evening.\\n\\n“I am here to greet you and to remember a brother of ours who was a victim of interests that didn’t want Bolivia’s freedom,” the pope said at the site. “He bothered them, and they eliminated him.”\\n\\nAsked about reports that Pope Francis had rebuked Mr. Morales for the gift, the spokesman told reporters he didn’t think the pope had “made a particular judgment” about the object. He noted that Pope Francis has spoken frequently against the ideological exploitation of religion, but just as frequently for openness to dialogue with different systems of thought and belief.\\n\\nAs a Jesuit priest and bishop in Argentina in the 1970s and ‘80s, Pope Francis embraced versions of so-called liberation theology that affirmed the church’s “preferential option for the poor,” but distanced himself from elements in the movement that adopted Marxist concepts such as “class struggle,” which also drew censure from the Vatican’s doctrinal office.\\n\\n—Kejal Vyas and Ryan Dube contributed to this article.\\n\\nWrite to Francis X.

       "  'text': 'Every week, CIO Journal offers a glimpse into the mind of the CEO, whose view of technology is shaped by stories in management journals, general interest magazines and, of course, in-flight publications.\\n\\nMake the summer games great again? With fears of Zika outbreaks, terrorist attacks and Guanabara Bay “floaters”, the news coverage run-up to the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro, commencing tonight, reads like a trip through Dante’s Inferno…on Russian steroids. Could it be any worse? Well, yes, if one considers the original games in Greece, Foreign Policy’s David Clay Large suggests. Far from being a celebration of peace and amateurism, the games were bedeviled by fighting spectators–and the occasional invading army–smelly Spartans and Mt. Olympus-sized doping habits. “Their nostrums included dried mushrooms, exotic herbal concoctions, animal hearts and testicles, and even an opiates-laced juice cocktail,” Mr. Large writes. And while today’s athletes in Rio may have to contend with uncooperative plumbing, ancient athletes had it worse. “Swarms of black flies and other bugs infesting those microbe-laden latrines brought on epidemics of gastroenteritis and diarrhea, often fatal.”\\n\\nWhy growth will fall. Or, Bill is bullish. This year’s summer read is an 800-page economic history book that “weighs as much as a small dog,” William D. Nordhaus writes in The New York Review of Books. “The Rise and Fall of American Growth: The U.S. Standard of Living Since the Civil War,” by Robert J. Gordon, “one of America’s leading macroeconomists,” tracks the “special century” from 1870 to 1970 where living standards exploded. The book is trending on executive digital bookshelves, and not only for its economic analysis and history, but also for its argument, in the last 200 pages, that the rate of innovation since 1970 has slowed–Silicon Valley visionaries be damned. Mr. Gordon “sees no prospect that we will find a similar set of inventions of such breadth and depth in the near future,” Mr. Nordhaus writes. But Bill Gates, in a blog post, cares to disagree. “My money is on the incredible forces of technological progress at work every day.”\\n\\nSaving globalization and technology from themselves. As support erodes for globalization and technology, the engine’s behind today’s unparalleled prosperity, it is time for businesses to confront “the growing divide between winners and losers,” say Boston Consulting Group’s CEO Rich Lesser, and colleagues Martin Reeves and Johann Harnoss. They suggest a seven-point technology-heavy agenda for business leaders, starting with a new approach to globalization that goes beyond cost-cutting offshoring. “Technology will be crucial,” they write “For example, the use of analytics and robotics could bring manufacturing closer to target markets.” Ultimately, businesses need to “own the narrative,” making the case for globalization and technology but also addressing side effects. “It is time for a credible, inclusive, and trust-inspiring narrative, both for the direction of our societies and the sharing of benefits and opportunity within them.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'Norman Vincent Peale, author of \"The Power of Positive Thinking,\" once wrote these words: “Change your thoughts, and you change your world.”\\n\\nHis statement is highlighted at the beginning of my new book, \"How to Choose a Husband and Make Peace with Marriage.\" Its premise is that if women want to be successful in love, they should reject the cultural script they’ve been sold and adopt a whole new view of men and marriage.\\n\\nAs products of divorce, the modern generation has few role models for lasting love. That alone is a problem. But young women have an added burden: they’ve been raised in a society that eschews marriage. They’ve been taught instead to honor sex, singlehood and female empowerment.\\n\\nConsider this statement by Rebecca Traister in Marie Claire: “The world as we’ve known it for a very long time—one in which a woman’s value was tied to her role as a wife—is ending, right in front of us. It is now standard for a woman to spend years on her own, learning, working, earning, socializing, having sex, and yes, having babies in the manner she—and she alone—sees fit. We are living through the invention of independent female adulthood.”\\n\\nThis message is not an anomaly; the idea that women don’t need men or marriage is palpable. It began in earnest more than forty years ago, with the modern feminist movement. Feminists assured women their efforts would result in more satisfying marriages, but the result is something else altogether. It looks something like this:\\n\\n1. Women postpone marriage indefinitely and move in and out of intense romantic relationships, or even live with their boyfriends for years at a time. Eventually, their biological clocks start ticking and many decide they better hurry up and get married to provide a stable home for their yet-to-be-born children. Trouble is, their boyfriend’s not willing to commit.\\n\\n2. Marriage becomes a competitive sport. The complementary nature of marriage—in which two people work together, as equals, toward the same goal but with an appreciation for the qualities each gender brings to the table—has been obliterated. Today, husbands and wives are locked in a battle about whom does more on the home front and how they’re going to get everything done. That’s not a marriage. That’s war.\\n\\nIt’s time to say what no one else will: Feminism didn’t result in equality between the sexes – it resulted in mass confusion. Today, men and women have no idea who’s supposed to do what.\\n\\nPrior to the 1970s, people viewed gender roles as as equally valuable. Many would argue women had the better end of the deal! It’s hard to claim women were oppressed in a nation in which men were expected to stand up when a lady enters the room or to lay down their lives to spare women life. When the Titanic went down in 1912, its sinking took 1,450 lives. Only 103 were women. One-hundred three.\\n\\nCompare that with last year’s wrecked cruise line, the Costa Concordia. It resulted in fewer deaths, but there was another significant difference. “There was no ‘women and children first’ policy. There were big men, crew members, pushing their way past us to get into the lifeboats. It was disgusting,” said passenger Sandra Rogers, 62.\\n\\nThe captain of the ship agrees. In USA Today, Francesco Schettino was asked about his New Year’s resolution. He responded, “Bone up on the parts about ‘women and children first’ and ‘the captain goes down with his ship.’”\\n\\nYou see, the problem with equality is that it implies two things are interchangeable – meaning one thing can be substituted for the other with no ramifications. That is what feminists would have us believe, and anyone who contradicts this dogma is branded sexist.\\n\\nBut the truth must be heard. Being equal in worth, or value, is not the same as being identical, interchangeable beings. Men and women may be capable of doing many of the same things, but that doesn’t mean they want to. That we don’t have more female CEOs or stay-at-home dads proves this in spades.\\n\\nUnless, of course, you’re beholden to feminism. In that case, you’ll believe the above is evidence of discrimination. You’ll believe what feminists taught you to believe: that gender is a social construct.\\n\\nThose of us with children know better. We know little girls love their dolls and boys just want to kick that ball. This doesn’t mean men can’t take care of babies or women can’t play sports. It just means each gender has its own energy that flows in a specific direction. For God’s sake, let it flow.\\n\\nThe battle of the sexes is over. And guess what? No one won. Why not try something else on for size? Like this: men and women are equal, but different. They’ve each been blessed with amazing and unique qualities that they bring to the table. Isn’t it time we stopped fussing about who brought what and simply enjoy the feast?\\n\\nSuzanne Venker has written extensively about politics, parenting, and the influence of feminism on American society. Her latest book, \"How to Choose a Husband and Make Peace with Marriage,\" is now available at Amazon.

       "  'title': 'The Local Food Movement Is Rooted in Globalization',\n",
       "  'date': '2011083119',\n",
       "  'text': 'Charles C. Mann has faced up to the locavore’s dilemma. At his home in the Berkshires, he likes to eat food that has traveled directly from his own garden: heirloom tomatoes, eggplant, bell peppers, kale, chard, lettuce and other foods for his table. He and his family belong to a farm-share program in which they advance money each year to a farmer a few miles away in return for the farm’s crops. He loves local food, but he knows too much about it to be a truly devout locavore.\\n\\nMr. Mann realizes that none of the foods in his garden or at the local farm originated within 1,000 miles of his home. They grow today in the Berkshires only because of farmers and plant breeders and traders throughout the world. While today’s locavores worry about the sustainability of the globalized modern system of agriculture, Mr. Mann sees today’s food system as nothing new.\\n\\nThe foods we consider local are results of a globalization process that has been in full swing for more than five centuries, ever since Columbus landed in the New World. Suddenly all the continents were linked, mixing plants and animals that had evolved separately since the breakup of the ancient supercontinent Pangaea.\\n\\nWhat resulted, Mr. Mann argues in his fascinating new book, “1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created,” was a new epoch in human life, the Homogenocene. This age of homogeneity was brought on by the creation of a world-spanning economic system as crops, worms, parasites and people traveled among Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia — the Columbian Exchange, as it was dubbed by the geographer Alfred W. Crosby.\\n\\n“The Columbian Exchange,” Mr. Mann writes, “is the reason there are tomatoes in Italy, oranges in the United States, chocolates in Switzerland and chili peppers in Thailand. To ecologists, the Columbian Exchange is arguably the most important event since the death of the dinosaurs.”\\n\\nThe consequences were devastating for many ecosystems and people conquered by Europeans. Before the exchange, Beijing was the world’s largest city, and nearly all the other large ones were in warm regions outside Europe. Columbus was seeking a new route to Asia because of the technologically advanced economies that were thriving there.\\n\\nAfter the Columbian Exchange, the cities of Europe became the planet’s boom towns, and it wasn’t just because of the Europeans’ culture and guns. Europeans prevailed by changing ecosystems, often in inadvertent ways that have only recently been measured by scientists.\\n\\nThe earthworms that traveled with the English settlers to Jamestown played havoc with the forests and the crops of the Indians. The island of Hispaniola was overrun by fire ants after the Spanish arrived. Throughout the Americas, the settlers introduced organisms that spread horrific epidemics of malaria, yellow fever, smallpox and other diseases.\\n\\nMeanwhile, people in Europe were reaping nutritional benefits from the Columbian Exchange. Europeans’ diets improved radically from the introduction of potatoes and what Mr. Mann calls the first green revolution: the widespread use of fertilizer, made possible by the importing of guano from Peru.\\n\\nAs always, there were trade-offs. In China, the introduction of maize and sweet potatoes to the highlands provided vital sustenance — and erosion that flooded rice paddies. A ship carrying guano fertilizer to Europe was probably also the source of the organism that blighted the potato crops in Europe and led to the great famine in Ireland in the 1840s.\\n\\nMr. Mann has come to sympathize with both sides in the debate over globalization. The opponents of globalization correctly realize that trade produces unpredictable and destructive consequences for the environment and for society, he says, but globalization also leads to more and better food, better health, longer life and other benefits that affluent Western locavores take for granted.\\n\\n“There are these huge catastrophes that constantly threaten the gains, but I think they only threaten the gains,” he said in an interview. “The lesson of history is that the costs are high — and higher than the advocates of free trade often admit — but the gains are higher still.”\\n\\nThat lesson, though, has always run counter to the intuition of people all over the world. Like today’s locavores, monarchs in Spain and China during the 16th century were deeply suspicious of becoming dependent on foreign food (although the rulers kept failing in their attempts to restrain trade). The monarchs also resented parting with their own crops, a feeling that persists today.',\n",

       "  'text': \"The benefits of free trade are clear: larger markets, lower prices and a diversity of product choices, to name a few.\\n\\nBut the losers in free trade, including textile workers in North Carolina and garlic farmers in California, are just as evident.\\n\\nThe answer to the losers does not rely in restricting trade; rather, what is needed is a social system of job training and equitable financial support that can sustain those who lose their jobs.\\n\\nJob loss is inevitable as markets mature and consumer tastes change. It is unclear how a restricted trade regime that leads inevitably to higher prices, lower product diversity and smaller markets for companies like Boeing will help either the unemployed or society.\\n\\nDavid AbrahamWashington, Dec. 25, 2006\\n\\nLooking for good news stories to help sell the benefits of free trade to American labor is as out of place as the Bush administration looking for good news stories to help sell the Iraqi war to the American people. Doing so is a form of denial that refuses to see the big picture.\\n\\nCountries engaged in free trade experience factor-price equalization: as price finds its equalization point, so will the cost of labor and capital. That’s the big picture, and it’s bad news for high-wage American labor whose wages will be seeking an equalization point with low-wage labor.\\n\\nThe era of wage stagnation is upon us. A stronger social safety net can help mitigate the damage, but it can’t stem the damage done by factor-price equalization. That job requires international economic standards that carry enforceable sanctions. One such standard should be the right for labor to associate. Otherwise, countries without it, like China, can more easily keep their labor wages from rising, which in turn puts even more downward pressure on high-wage countries.\\n\\nEnough denial about free trade; enough cherry-picking over isolated instances like the Boeing story. Say it loud: the era of wage stagnation is upon us. That’s the big picture for labor in high-wage countries.\\n\\nWilliam J. Dailey Richmond Hill, Queens\\n\\nBoeing is a poor example to teach the general benefits of globalization. It is exceptional in every sense, being one of only two large civilian aircraft manufacturers in the world. Its recent success with the 747, moreover, is directly due to Airbus’s getting tangled in its own wiring, delaying deliveries of its A380. Boeing’s monopoly on very large jets for the next few years is therefore hardly a testament to the “win-win” of globalization.\\n\\nThe central problem is that labor in an increasingly globalized environment is increasingly fungible. There is no fundamental solution to this other than wage equalization, probably a combination of lower wages here and higher wages overseas.\\n\\nAndrei MoskowitzNew York, Dec. 25, 2006\\n\\nWhen the United States has a government that’s bought and paid for by the wealthiest 5 percent, how can we be surprised that while globalization has bolstered the economy, “the benefits in this country have gone disproportionately to the wealthy”?\\n\\nSo to claim that government needs to provide for “a stronger safety net for workers cut loose in the upheaval of a changing economy,” and that the United States “needs a more progressive tax system and the government must find a way to help businesses and individuals with out-of-control health care costs” is disingenuous at best.\\n\\nWhat’s the answer? Change the game. Those in the middle class have to learn to become savvy investors, and in this respect they must transform themselves. If the “game” no longer works because you’re in a “losing” position, change the game! I’m betting on the ingenuity of the United States middle class.\\n\\nRichie KesslerVieques, P.R., Dec. 25, 2006\\n\\nYou are right: “The United States needs a more progressive tax system and the government must find a way to help businesses and individuals with out-of-control health care costs.”\\n\\nReaders might remember our nation’s last major “ideological conflict.” During and after World War II, the top income tax bracket was 91 percent.\\n\\nReturning to such a system would accomplish both your objectives. It would help pay for health care, education and countless other needs. In addition, it would restrain the obscenely high compensation of many corporate executives and other believers in “greed is good,” and reduce the alarming gap between the haves and the have-nots.\\n\\nJohn GlaselHoboken, N.J., Dec. 25, 2006The writer is secretary of Health Care for All/New Jersey.\\n\\nA version of this letter appears in print on , on Page WK7 of the New York edition with the headline: Globalization’s Winners and Losers.

       "  'text': 'Faith matters. Even if you are not of religious faith yourself. Over 4 billion people world-wide recognize themselves as religious. They may not attend an organized place of worship. But Faith plays a part in their lives. A recent poll found that religion is important for around 30-35% of people in Europe, 65% of Americans and for about 90% of people in most Muslim-majority countries.\\n\\nI started the Tony Blair Faith Foundation because I believe the modern world cannot work unless people from different faiths and cultures learn to live in peaceful co-existence with each other. Understanding increases the possibility of peace. Ignorance increases the potential for division.\\n\\nThe reason this is so important today is that globalization is shrinking the space we live in, making us share it, pushing people together in a way that is unique in human history. Some dislike this process. Some, like me, are content and even welcome it. But, for sure, it is a fact.\\n\\nIn this world, if religious faith becomes a counter force to this process, one which pulls people apart, then it becomes reactionary and divisive. So if I define myself as a Christian in opposition to you as a Muslim, then just as we are forced to live together by globalization, so we are forced apart by a view of religious faith that is exclusionary and hostile to those of a different faith to our own.\\n\\nThe Tony Blair Faith Foundation works in a number of ways to prevent this happening. One way is an inter-faith encounter through action, which is why we are supporting the UN anti-malaria campaign, to mobilize the faith communities to become centres of distribution for bed nets and medicines in Africa. We work also for reconciliation where religion is a dimension in political conflict, as in the Middle East. A key part of our work is education. In partnership with Yale University in the United States we now have a \"Faith and Globalization\" course which began last year. This is now being extended to four other universities world-wide.\\n\\nNow we are adding a new dimension: an education program linking up schools across the globe and across the faith divide. Launching officially today is Face to Faith, the new global schools project from my Foundation, designed to encourage young people of different faiths to learn directly with, from and about each other. Through structured video-conferencing, an online community and a course syllabus, Face to Faith gets secondary school students from across the world working together, investigating big global issues; sharing their own opinions, values and beliefs; and exploring the reasons for similar and different views. In this way, Face to Faith encourages young people to recognize the similarities between faiths but also, importantly, to respect and deal with the differences between diverse and often conflicting worldviews, helping to equip them to live in a global society made up of different faiths and beliefs.\\n\\nDeveloped by an international group of educational experts and piloted with more than 1000 students on three continents, Face to Faith encourages young people to research what different faiths have to say about key global issues. The program supports them to explore the doctrines, practices and stories of major world religions; and, importantly, to understand the role of faith in the lives of others. How do their peers - believers and nonbelievers - feel and think, and think about what others assume about them?\\n\\nYoung people involved in the pilot are already reporting how their understanding of the role of faith in today\\'s world has increased by learning from those of differing social, cultural and religious perspectives. A student from Indian Heights School in New Delhi commented; \\'It\\'s so much more interesting and real to learn directly from people of a different religion rather than simply reading about them in a book.\\'\\n\\nI am particularly impressed by the way our lead school in the US, St Thomas the Apostle, has taken up the challenge. Christina Teisch, Principal at St. Thomas the Apostle, has been an early pioneer of the program, and her pupils have responded superbly. St. Thomas the Apostle\\'s engagement in Face to Faith is a testament to the way in which the US has embraced the concepts of a globalized world and the way in which people of different faiths must live within it. They have been a valuable leader in the development of this program. Christina says,\\n\\n\\'For centuries, the aggression of our global societies have been threatened by religious conflicts. In no other way can we as educators guide our students towards peace than through dialogue, understanding and respect of all faiths on earth. My experience of the Face to Faith program has already given me invaluable knowledge of the challenges and triumphs of educators from various countries.\\'\\n\\nAlready, schools in Pakistan, India, Lebanon, the Palestinian Territories, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, the UK, US and Canada have taken up the Face to Faith program and some interesting offshoots are emerging. Two schools in Canada and Palestine are extending the program, originally designed for 11-16 year olds, by arranging video conference discussions between groups of parents and grandparents interested in improving their own understanding of different faiths. And these adults are not the only ones. One of the Lebanese teachers involved in the program commented; \\'One of the highlights of Face to Faith is the regular exchange with the other teachers of different faiths who have already taught me so much about different practices and perspectives.\\'\\n\\nThe Tony Blair Faith Foundation is dedicated to achieving understanding, action and reconciliation between the different faiths for the common good. It is not about the faith that looks inward; but the faith that resolutely turns us towards each other. The new program I am launching today, Face to Faith, has started a global conversation about and between different religions; a true conversation between people despite differences. An increase in religious literacy must surely follow and, with it, a new generation committed to interfaith understanding and respect.\\n\\nFormer British Prime Minister Tony Blair is founder of the Tony Blair Faith Foundation.

His advisers, as he set off for the strife-torn Middle East had to persuade him not to go dressed as a priest.\\n\\nAs there his intervention was no resounding success he looked for something to do that would cause him less stress. What steps could he take to ensure his eternal salvation? Of course!

And, if that were not enough, it would the economy improve.\\n\\nTony stated that he wanted it well understood his Foundation would sell religion as a force for our good. To learn how it would do that we anxiously awaited, as we listened to him pontificating with breath that was bated.\\n\\nIts first task, he suggested, should be to donate mosquito nets to people who face increasing malaria threats. Will each one be blessed by Tony as he worries and frets to make sure they are given only the holiest of nets?\\n\\nIf any are offered by donors who do not in religion believe, will his Faith Foundation decline them to receive? While he still keeps insisting he is always most sincere, that Tony has gone round the bend is now demonstrably clear.\\n\\nWhat is his ultimate goal as he sets out to do good? Could he be preparing the way for a future sainthood?

WHERE: R is RELIGION, i is iNTELlectuals, S is SOCiETY, E is ECONOMY (Choice/Choosing if any) and P is Political & M is Military & G = Government. This \"R\" proves that R.eligion is not like the PATTERNs of a Butterfly or, nor like what OUR father/Prophet of Many Hir Albert Einstein [pbuh et al] mentioned as if We are all Snails & each of our Shells has a Unique Pattern (not Religion).

       "  'text': 'Feminism has never exactly been thought of as a laugh riot, but somehow Wendy Wasserstein managed to locate its funny bone. Not by mocking it -- she was an ardent believer -- but by making the intoxicating, bewildering choices it presented to women a natural ingredient of the human comedy.\\n\\nFrom her earliest efforts, such as \"Uncommon Women and Others,\" to the mid-career triumph of the Pulitzer Prize-winning \"Heidi Chronicles\" to such later, sardonic plays as \"An American Daughter\" and \"Third,\" Wasserstein made her central subjects the question of what women of her generation wanted and the less facile realities of what they got.\\n\\n\"Having it all.\" Ha! In Wasserstein\\'s work, the phrase engendered as much in the way of confusion as freedom.\\n\\nShe charted an up-and-down theatrical career through the changing longitudes and latitudes of her life. It\\'s not surprising that many who admired her writing for the stage felt as if they were forging a personal relationship with her, as her tastefully sunny plays seemed to grow up with them, recounting episodes at college and work and family gatherings and bouts in later middle age with wearying illnesses.\\n\\nAnd now she has died at age 55, five years younger than the great August Wilson, whose passing occurred a scant four months ago. Her death by lymphoma came yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The theater world, knowing for several weeks that she was gravely sick, had been keeping a word-of-mouth vigil for her, and still the news of the demise of such an ebullient chronicler of New York womanhood was a shock. And even sadder because of Lucy, the 6-year-old daughter she leaves behind. Wasserstein had Lucy at age 48 by artificial insemination, and the biological father was a friend whom the unmarried Wasserstein never identified publicly.\\n\\nThe American theater these days is like an appliance in a model line that\\'s no longer being dependably stocked. When a part goes, where do you turn to order the replacement? Wasserstein\\'s plays were not uniformly satisfying. After the Broadway acclaim for \"The Heidi Chronicles\" (1989) and the warmly observed \"Sisters Rosensweig,\" (1993), she was unable to sing as acutely in any other key. But make no mistake: She had established herself as a commercially successful Broadway dramatist in an era when virtually no other woman -- heck, virtually no one at all -- was doing so. Her comedies will justly be remembered as vibrant documents of an urbane baby-boom generation and the more progressive view of women it embraced.\\n\\nShe was sort of the Neil Simon of the ERA. (If you don\\'t know that ERA stands for \"Equal Rights Amendment,\" you are probably too young to have appreciated Wasserstein in her prime.) In fairness, her plays were more topical than Simon\\'s, and although she often could not resist the ba-dum-bum temptations of the slick one-liner, her comedy was both more humane and more calculated to get a rise out of members of her own choir. The comedies are filled with knowing references to highbrow culture and pop, from Wittgenstein to Judy Collins. \"Do you know,\" one of the students observes in \"Uncommon Women and Others\" -- the 1977 play set at her alma mater, Mount Holyoke College -- \"the first time I ever really understood about diaphragms or sex was from reading \\'The Group.\\' \"\\n\\n\"Wendy couldn\\'t help but write a happy ending in everything she wrote because her business was comedy,\" says Ari Roth, artistic director of Theater J. In 2004, his company, ensconced at the D.C. Jewish Community Center, premiered a double bill of Wasserstein playlets, one of which, \"Third,\" later was expanded and then presented last autumn by Lincoln Center Theater. \"She knew how she wanted to end her plays, and so they ended with satisfaction and redemption, even though they could also be bittersweet.\"\\n\\nIn person she could be bubbly, ingratiating, resolutely unglamorous. She had a pudding face, she was rumpled, her hair was often a twisting thicket of unruly curls, and there was a magnetism in her wit and lack of vanity. City-born and -bred, she seemed a quintessential product of New York, always running with the \"in\" theater crowd: Her wide range of pals included such writers as New York Times columnist Frank Rich and such elite drama people as Andre Bishop, artistic director at Lincoln Center Theater, who in stints there and earlier at Playwrights Horizons first presented the bulk of her work.\\n\\nShe wasn\\'t wildly prolific, but \"Heidi\" -- which records the life and times of an art history professor passing through the turbulent, evolutionary late 1960s, \\'70s and \\'80s -- cemented her position as an \"event\" playwright.\\n\\nShe was also a cultural humorist, an observer of the Manhattan folkways of Saks and Zabar\\'s, the Met and the Plaza. Her articles regularly appeared in newspapers and magazines. She wrote about her love of the theater, most memorably in a children\\'s book, \"Pamela\\'s First Musical,\" that\\'s been adapted as, yes, a musical. One of the theater projects she championed was the \"Open Doors\" program administered by the Theater Development Fund, which sent public high school students to a season\\'s worth of plays and musicals, accompanied by professionals in the theater.\\n\\n\"New York playwright liberal\" was the title she conferred on herself, with a degree of wryness, during an interview I conducted with her in March 1997 in Cafe Un Deux Trois, a theater district bistro. At the time, she was preparing for the debut of her most overtly political play, \"An American Daughter,\" inspired by the Zoe Baird incident. Baird was President Bill Clinton\\'s nominee for attorney general who withdrew after it was revealed that she had employed illegal immigrants in her home. Like many of Wasserstein\\'s plays, this one eventually made its way to Washington: \"An American Daughter\" was produced in 2003 at Arena Stage.\\n\\nWasserstein viewed Baird\\'s turmoil as emblematic of the progress women had made and the bias that persisted against those who tried to rise too high in a man\\'s world. Still, the piece lacked the brand of native wisdom, that heightened knowledge of a subject from the inside out, that characterized \"Uncommon Women\" and \"The Heidi Chronicles.\" The play got tepid receptions here and in New York.\\n\\nAlthough her health seemed to decline shortly after the difficult birth of her daughter, Wasserstein returned in her last plays to topics of more intimate concern. \"Welcome to My Rash,\" the playlet paired at Theater J with \"Third,\" took up the question of a woman with facial paralysis and a mysterious rash between her legs. It was a rather sober work, looking at the issue of a middle-aged writer and a brush with mortality.\\n\\nTrue to her nature, Wasserstein wrote an upbeat conclusion. The character undergoes an experimental transfusion and, as Roth put it, \"regains her equilibrium.\"\\n\\n\"That was Wendy,\" he adds. \"Ever the optimist.\"',\n",
