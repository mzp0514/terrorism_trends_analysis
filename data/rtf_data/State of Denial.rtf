Dan Stout that law enforcement's handling of white supremacy was broken came in September 2017, as he was sitting in an emergency-operations center in Gainesville, Fla., preparing for the onslaught of Hurricane Irma and watching what felt like his thousandth YouTube video of the recent violence in Charlottesville, Va. Jesus Christ, he thought, studying the footage in which crowds of angry men, who had gathered to attend or protest the Unite the Right rally, set upon one another with sticks and flagpole spears and flame throwers and God knows what else. A black man held an aerosol can, igniting the spray, and in retaliation, a white man picked up his gun, pointed it toward the black man and fired it at the ground. The Virginia state troopers, inexplicably, stood by and watched. Stout fixated on this image, wondering what kind of organizational failure had led to the debacle. He had one month to ensure that the same thing didn't happen in Gainesville.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf3 Before that August, Stout, a 24-year veteran of the Gainesville police force, had never heard of Richard Spencer and knew next to nothing about his self-declared alt-right movement, or of their ''anti-fascist'' archnemesis known as Antifa. Then, on the Monday after deadly violence in Charlottesville, in which a protester was killed when a driver plowed his car into the crowd, Stout learned to his horror that Spencer was planning a speech at the University of Florida. He spent weeks frantically trying to get up to speed, scouring far-right and anti-fascist websites and videos, each click driving him further into despair. Aside from the few white nationalists who had been identified by the media or on Twitter, Stout had no clue who most of these people were, and neither, it seemed, did anyone else in law enforcement. }

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf3   There were no current intelligence reports he could find on the alt-right, the sometimes-violent fringe movement that embraces white nationalism and a range of racist positions. The state police couldn't offer much insight. Things were equally bleak at the federal level. Whatever the F.B.I. knew (which wasn't a lot, Stout suspected), they weren't sharing. The Department of Homeland Security, which produced regular intelligence and threat assessments for local law enforcement, had only scant material on white supremacists, all of it vague and ultimately not much help. Local politicians, including the governor, were also in the dark. This is like a Bermuda Triangle of intelligence, Stout thought, incredulous. He reached out to their state partners. ''So you're telling us that there's nothing? No names we can plug into the automatic license-plate readers? No players with a propensity for violence? No one you have in the system? Nothing?''}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf3   One of those coming to Gainesville was William Fears, a 31-year-old from Houston. Fears, who online went by variations of the handle Antagonizer, was one of the most dedicated foot soldiers of the alt-right. Countless YouTube videos had captured his progress over the past year as he made his way from protest to protest across several states, flinging Nazi salutes, setting off smoke bombs and, from time to time, attacking people. Fears was also a felon. He had spent six years in prison for aggravated kidnapping in a case involving his ex-girlfriend, and now he had an active warrant for his arrest, after his new girlfriend accused him of assault less than two weeks earlier. On Oct. 18, the night before the event, Fears and a few others from Houston's white-nationalist scene got in Fears's silver Jeep Patriot for the 14-hour drive. Fears's friend Tyler TenBrink, who pleaded guilty to assault in 2014, posted video from their trip on his Facebook page. There were four men, two of them felons, and two nine-millimeter handguns. ''Texans always carry,'' Fears said later.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf3   Gainesville would be Spencer's first major public appearance since the violence of the Unite the Right rally two months before, and the city, a progressive enclave in the heart of deep-red north Florida, was on edge. Anticipating chaos, Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency -- prompting Spencer to tweet out an image of his head making its way across the Atlantic toward Florida: ''Hurricane Spencer.'' A few days before the event, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement sent out a small, bound ''threat book'' of about 20 or so figures, most of them openly affiliated with Spencer or with anti-fascist groups, which Stout knew from his own research meant they weren't the people to worry about. Anonymous online chatter on sites like 4chan, meanwhile, described armed right-wing militants coming to Gainesville to test Florida's Stand Your Ground law. Stout envisioned 20 white supremacists with long guns. We're screwed, he thought.}

More than 1,100 state troopers and local cops stood on alert, with another 500 on standby. There were officers posted on rooftops. Police helicopters buzzed the skies. The Florida National Guard had been activated off-site, and a line of armored vehicles sat in reserve. Hundreds of journalists from around the United States and abroad were in attendance, anticipating another Charlottesville.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf3   Some 2,500 protesters had descended on the small area cordoned off for the event, where they confronted a handful of white supremacists, most of them Spencer groupies like Fears and his friends. ''Basically, I'm just fed up with the fact that I'm cisgendered, I'm a white male and I lean right, toward the Republican side, and I get demonized,'' Colton Fears, Will's 28-year-old brother, who was wearing an SS pin, told HuffPost. TenBrink, also 28, told The Washington Post that he had come to support Spencer because after Charlottesville, where he was seen and photographed, he had been threatened by the ''radical left.'' He seemed agitated by the thousands of protesters. ''This is a mess,'' he told The Gainesville Sun. ''It appears that the only answer left is violence, and nobody wants that.''}

''It's always been socially acceptable to punch a Nazi, to attack people if they have right-wing political leanings,'' he said. ''We're starting to push back.'' He went on: ''We want to show our teeth a little bit because, you know, we're not to be taken lightly.''}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf3   The Spencer speech turned out to be a bust, thanks to an audience so determined to drown him out that at one point they erupted in a chant of ''Orange! Blue! Orange! Blue!'' as if at a Gators football game. Afterward, the crowd left the auditorium and flooded back onto Hull Road, the long avenue leading toward the center of campus. Thousands of protesters surrounded the small group of Spencer acolytes. TenBrink, a sinewy young man wearing a black T-shirt and jeans, was particularly overwhelmed and jumped a barricade to escape the angry crowd. The police put him in handcuffs and escorted him into a parking garage. Then, for reasons that remain unclear, they uncuffed TenBrink and walked him out of the garage and toward the parking lot, and let him go. Neither TenBrink nor his friends were in the threat book.}

It was about 5:15 p.m. The Texans drove down Archer Avenue, the broad street bordering the south edge of campus, about a mile from the secured area. A group of protesters were sitting at a bus stop. The men in the Jeep started shouting ''Heil Hitler!'' according to the police report and several witness statements. ''Do you know my friend Heil? Heil Hitler? Get it?'' The men started throwing Nazi salutes.}

When the Texans began to harass them, he grabbed his baton and struck a window of the S.U.V. ''My life and the lives of those around me was at risk,'' he told the police. Will Fears jumped out. ''I'm about to beat this dude up with his own fricking expandable baton,'' he later recalled.}

They also raise questions about the United States' counterterrorism strategy, which for nearly two decades has been focused almost exclusively on American and foreign-born jihadists, overshadowing right-wing extremism as a legitimate national-security threat. According to a recent report by the nonpartisan Stimson Center, between 2002 and 2017, the United States spent $2.8 trillion -- 15 percent of discretionary spending -- on counterterrorism. Terrorist attacks by Muslim extremists killed 100 people in the United States during that time. Between 2008 and 2017, domestic extremists killed 387 in the United States, according to the 2018 Anti-Defamation League report.}

Chapman was a 41-year-old who had two previous felony convictions.

Over the past two years, each group engaged in violent confrontations with their ideological enemies -- a lengthy list including African-Americans, Jews, Muslims, nonwhite immigrants, members of the L.G.B.T. community and the progressive left -- and generally escaped punishment. This changed to a degree over the past few weeks when, after a yearlong campaign by journalists at ProPublica and other media outlets, federal prosecutors filed charges against eight members of RAM, including two of its leaders. Similarly, after a pressure campaign on social media, the New York Police Department arrested and charged six members of the Proud Boys in connection with an assault after a speech by McInnes at a Republican club in Manhattan on Oct. 12.

The F.B.I. said in a statement: ''The F.B.I. does not and cannot police ideologies under the First Amendment.''

But there are millions of racists, anti-Semites, Islamophobes, homophobes and xenophobes who engage in eliminationist rhetoric about the communities of people they fear and hate every day on social media and radio talk shows.

By 2007, he had put together a small team of analysts who began to scour extremist websites and message boards. What they found alarmed them.}

Between October 2007 and March 2008, Johnson and his unit documented the formation of 45 new antigovernment militia groups, which he saw as highly significant given that before fall 2007, these sorts of groups had been on the decline. Some white-supremacist groups, seizing upon the anti-immigration rhetoric that was then fomenting, created violent video games aimed at exploiting public fear of ''illegals'' streaming over the border.}

Other threats and racist posts flooded the internet, where Johnson's team noticed a sharp increase in membership on Stormfront, the first major white-nationalist website. The site added 32,000 new users within the first three months after Obama's inauguration, nearly double the number it added in 2008.}

Napolitano ''got it'' when it came to white supremacy, says Juliette Kayyem, who served as the department's assistant secretary for intergovernmental affairs in 2009 and 2010. While serving as Arizona's attorney general, Napolitano coordinated the investigation of one of Timothy McVeigh's accomplices. Now, concerned that a reinvigorated white-supremacist movement could pose a threat to the country's first African-American president and to citizens, Napolitano began asking her intelligence analysts about a rise in lone-wolf ''right-wing extremism,'' a term commonly used in the counterterrorism world to refer to the radical beliefs of fringe players on the right of the political spectrum.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf3   In March 2009, Johnson says he and a few colleagues from the F.B.I. briefed Napolitano on their findings, theorizing that heightened stress because of the continuing financial crisis, coupled with the election of the first black president, created a ''unique driver'' for individual radicalization and antigovernment and white-supremacist recruitment. Military veterans, including those returning after multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, might be particularly susceptible candidates, they noted, a prediction based on a 2008 F.B.I. assessment that found 203 individuals with military experience who had joined white-supremacist groups since Sept. 11, 2001. It was a tiny number given the overall United States veteran population, which at the time was close to 24 million. It was also a small percentage of the thousands of white supremacists the F.B.I. estimated were active. But the ''prestige'' that those with military or tactical skills held within white-supremacist groups made their influence much greater, the F.B.I. argued.}

A link to the PDF was also posted on a blog maintained by the Oath Keepers, the antigovernment group composed of numerous law-enforcement officials. ''FORWARD THIS TO EVERY AMERICAN!'' read the post, which Johnson suspected had been written by a member of the law-enforcement community.

More mainstream right-wing pundits like Michelle Malkin considered it, in Malkin's words, an ''Obama D.H.S. hit job'' on conservatives. Some progressives also had concerns about the report's ''dangerously vague and speculative'' nature, as a Mother Jones correspondent, James Ridgeway, wrote, warning that ''civil libertarians of all stripes'' should be nervous and raising the specter of government surveillance.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf3   Congressional Republicans, answering to a nascent Tea Party movement and the American Legion, soon took issue with the label ''right-wing extremism,'' which John Boehner, then minority leader of the House, charged was being used by the Department of Homeland Security ''to describe American citizens who disagree with the direction Washington Democrats are taking our nation.'' Boehner was particularly bothered by the report's mention of veterans. ''To characterize men and women returning home after defending our country as potential terrorists is offensive and unacceptable,'' he said in a statement. Several G.O.P. lawmakers called for Napolitano's resignation, as well as that of Johnson, who, in their view, equated conservatives with terrorists.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf3   Johnson was appalled. ''I never anticipated such an aggressive, vile backlash,'' he told me recently. It was puzzling: Just a few months before his April 2009 report was published, the department released an assessment of the cyber threat posed by ''left-wing extremists,'' like the Earth Liberation Front and the Animal Liberation Front. Legislators, the media and the public at large -- including progressives -- had no objection to that terminology. But the political firestorm over ''right-wing extremism'' had caused such an uproar that the Department of Homeland Security ultimately avoided using ideological terminology like ''right-wing.'' A few weeks after the report was released, Napolitano formally apologized to veterans, and after intense pressure from veterans' groups, the department withdrew the report.}

The antigovernment Patriot movement gained 300 new groups over the same time period, a jump of over 60 percent. Every sphere of the far right was being energized at the same time. There was also an uptick in so-called lone wolves, who held extremist views but associated with no specific organization. In May 2010, a year after Johnson's report was released, a father and son from Ohio, members of a little-known antigovernment movement called ''sovereign citizens,'' shot and killed two police officers during a traffic stop in West Memphis, Ark. It was the 12th attack or foiled plot by white-extremist ''lone wolves'' since 2009, almost all of which received little publicity.}

H.V.E.s, who tended to be Muslim, were not to be mistaken for domestic terrorists, who by definition were not only Americans but also driven by a domestic ideology like white supremacy. And yet the two were often conflated, and therefore ''homegrowns'' were also perceived as domestic terrorists: the Tsarnaev brothers, responsible for the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013; the perpetrators of the San Bernardino massacre or the mass shooting at the gay nightclub Pulse in Orlando. Dylann Roof, born in South Carolina, whose homegrown racism was nurtured on neo-Nazi websites like The Daily Stormer, was not, in this context, a domestic terrorist, nor were any of his beliefs seen as indicative of ''violent extremism.'' His shooting spree in a church in Charleston, in which he killed nine African-Americans, was interpreted as something else. What drove him, authorities said, was hate. He was a murderer.}

He was 14 on Sept. 11, 2001, old enough to absorb the patriotic fervor of that moment but too young to enlist. For a year or two, he was a Michael Moore-style populist, having been ''red-pilled on 'Bowling for Columbine.' '' Then, having spent a great deal of his spare time stoned and watching YouTube, Fears embraced the Sept. 11 ''truthers'' movement. As he spent more and more time on sites like Infowars, he was exposed to notions that the government, backed by the Illumi-nati, the globalists, the Freemasons -- Jews, but not ''the Jews'' as he would later come to see them -- had blown up the towers, crashed the financial markets and plunged the country into economic crisis. This led to his next great obsession: the candidacy of the G.O.P. presidential hopeful Ron Paul, a libertarian who had amassed a large grass-roots following of what The New York Times then called ''iconoclastic white men.''}

In 2010, he was sentenced to seven years in prison.}

''White guys got to stick together,'' he says, referring to an admitted friendship with members of the Texas branch of the Aryan Brotherhood, one of the most notoriously brutal white-supremacist gangs in the country. But he dropped those friendships after prison, he insists. ''I didn't like the whole Nazi skinhead thing with tattoos on their face and beating up minorities for no reason,'' he says, implying that they represented an earlier generation: ''They're like 1.0s.''}

At home in the Houston suburb of Pasadena, Fears submerged himself in what to him was the new, hyperconnected world of the internet, where every YouTube video he watched algorithmically directed him to others with increasingly far-right political agendas. He was fascinated by men like Richard Spencer, who fashioned himself as the second coming of George Lincoln Rockwell, the founder of the American Nazi Party. He was also intrigued by Donald Trump, the troubadour of a new generation of angry white men, the alt-right movement -- white supremacy 2.0 -- with its in-jokes and symbols that were mostly lost on U.S. law enforcement.}

''The police didn't step in really at all,'' a police observer and representative of the National Lawyers Guild later told The Sacramento Bee. ''They basically just let people do what they wanted to do,'' the observer said. ''In this case, someone made a decision just to let them fight it out.'' Ten people were hospitalized, at least five for stabbing wounds and other lacerations, most of them left-wing counterprotesters, some of whom were later charged with assault. Only one white supremacist was arrested, though court records originally acquired by The Guardian mentioned at least four T.W.P.-affiliated men who came armed with knives to the rally but were not charged. ''We're looking at you as a victim,'' an investigator with the California Highway Patrol reportedly assured a member of the T.W.P. after the rally.}

By the summer of 2017, the media had begun to cover more far-right events, leading more people to show up in protest, which furthered the right's victimization narrative, which in turn led to more events and more violence, all of which was packaged into neat selling points for a movement whose actual real-life followers may have been far fewer than they appeared.}

Nathan Damigo, a former Marine who was incarcerated for five years for armed robbery, used footage of his punching a young woman in the face during a Berkeley protest as a recruiting video for his white-nationalist organization, Identity Evropa. The Proud Boys went as far as to create an entire culture around gang-style rituals, including initiation beatings.}

The F.B.I. itself was limited in its surveillance capacity (though many left-wing groups argued that this did not prevent the bureau from monitoring their activities), and in the absence of comprehensive federal scrutiny, right-wing activists trawled through left-wing websites, shared photos of leading anti-fascist and racial-justice activists and infiltrated real-life gatherings. In advance of the event, leaked chats documented potential attendees openly advising their comrades to take note of any threats of violence so they could share them with the police. Erroll Southers later remarked on the sophistication of advising their followers not to bring cellphones, and sharing information among small cells of affinity groups: ''From an intelligence perspective, it was very impressive.''}

But Charlottesville was another galaxy, both in the sheer number of marchers and their diversity. Southers notes, ''You had factions of white nationalists, white supremacists, Klan members, neo-Nazis, neo-Confederates -- which was like having ISIS, Al Qaeda, Al Shabab and Boko Haram at the same rally. And they were all rallying together, shoulder to shoulder, while the police watched these people go toe to toe sort of like a modern-day 'Game of Thrones' battle.''}

Jews, he said, ''have a biological need to look out for their own.'' He had spoken a bit about what he called the J.Q., or Jewish Question, as successive generations of anti-Semites have referred to the debate over how Western nations should handle the presence of Jews in their societies.

I also saw row after row of McMansions, many of them with swimming pools. There were new S.U.V.s parked in the driveways, and boats: signs of money made and money spent.

Some of them, he suggests, take part in his weekly Thursday-morning ''fight club,'' practicing mixed martial arts. Some have white-collar jobs or are veterans, groups that make up a large part of the movement.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf3   Fears was wearing a baseball cap adorned with a red, white and blue patch known as the ''whomster'' flag. It's ''kind of a racist joke,'' he said, albeit one that most people won't get, as they probably have no clue what ''whomster'' means (it's a common meme that refers to the supposed, if baseless, fact that African-Americans say ''whomst'' a lot). The flag featured the Texas lone star against a backdrop of 14 red and white stripes, an allusion to a signature white supremacist slogan addressing their goal of preserving the white race. The star is centered on a large blue sonnerad, or black sun, an ancient symbol favored by white supremacists, who see it as less obvious than, say, a swastika. In recent years, even longtime neo-Nazi groups like the National Socialist Movement have rebranded by dropping the swastika for less ''triggering'' symbols like sonnerads or runes. The meaning is the same.}

And while I happened to be sitting across the table from an admitted fascist who admires Adolf Hitler and has advocated (he says trollishly) ''white Shariah,'' I didn't feel threatened by Will Fears. Like so many of the movement's vague anymen, he presented himself as polite, articulate and interested in cultural politics, and though his views are abhorrent, he stated them all so laconically you might forget that he actually believes in the concept of a white ethnostate. And that's the point: The genius of the new far right, if we could call it ''genius,'' has been their steadfast determination to blend into the larger fabric of society to such an extent that perhaps the only way you might see them as a problem is if you actually want to see them at all.}

''The level of resources and financial impact these types of events are now costing communities to prepare for and manage, it's just unsustainable,'' he says. ''How much of our city do we literally turn into a quasi-police state to manage this?'' Stout's study of the alt-right and left-wing movements made him an ''expert,'' at least in the eyes of federal and state law enforcement, who, he says, began to invite him to visit their jurisdictions to share what he had learned. ''They were soaking it up like a sponge,'' he says. And yet, in reality he feels that they had collectively dodged a bullet -- ''no pun intended,'' he says. ''Just another inch to the right or the left and we'd have had a very bad situation.''}

Joshua Phanco, a prosecutor who at the time was in charge of Fears's case, was alarmed by the call. He vaguely recalled that Fears had been in prison in Florida, but he wasn't aware that Fears had been charged with attempted murder, or that he had anything to do with white supremacy. ''This is the first I'm hearing this,'' he told me. (Fears's charge in Florida has since been dropped.)}

He diagramed the byzantine system that is the Harris County criminal-justice system, one of the nation's largest, and a study in dysfunction. There is no central database, no way to share information among all the tiny police departments that feed into the clerk's office, which then divvies up crimes among 22 criminal courts, now scattered across the entire county. Basically, he said, unless someone tells him about a guy he's prosecuting, he has no clue.}

''But who's responsible for keeping track of these alt-right guys in Houston? Nobody. For me the question is, well, how come? If you want to look at these guys as terrorists -- which I think it is when they're firing guns out of cars at protesters,'' he noted, ''then the question remains: Who or what will prevent him from committing more crimes? And, from my chair, nobody,'' Phanco said. ''Nobody's watching it, nobody's tracking it. And that's what's got me scared.''}
