Dan Stout that law enforcement\u8217 s handling of white supremacy was broken came in September 2017, as he was sitting in an emergency-operations center in Gainesville, Fla., preparing for the onslaught of Hurricane Irma and watching what felt like his thousandth YouTube video of the recent violence in Charlottesville, Va. Jesus Christ, he thought, studying the footage in which crowds of angry men, who had gathered to attend or protest the Unite the Right rally, set upon one another with sticks and flagpole spears and flame throwers and God knows what else. A black man held an aerosol can, igniting the spray, and in retaliation, a white man picked up his gun, pointed it toward the black man and fired it at the ground. The Virginia state troopers, inexplicably, stood by and watched. Stout fixated on this image, wondering what kind of organizational failure had led to the debacle. He had one month to ensure that the same thing didn\u8217 t happen in Gainesville.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf3 Before that August, Stout, a 24-year veteran of the Gainesville police force, had never heard of Richard Spencer and knew next to nothing about his self-declared alt-right movement, or of their \u8220 anti-fascist\u8221  archnemesis known as Antifa. Then, on the Monday after deadly violence in Charlottesville, in which a protester was killed when a driver plowed his car into the crowd, Stout learned to his horror that Spencer was planning a speech at the University of Florida. He spent weeks frantically trying to get up to speed, scouring far-right and anti-fascist websites and videos, each click driving him further into despair. Aside from the few white nationalists who had been identified by the media or on Twitter, Stout had no clue who most of these people were, and neither, it seemed, did anyone else in law enforcement.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf3 There were no current intelligence reports he could find on the alt-right, the sometimes-violent fringe movement that embraces white nationalism and a range of racist positions. The state police couldn\u8217 t offer much insight. Things were equally bleak at the federal level. Whatever the F.B.I. knew (which wasn\u8217 t a lot, Stout suspected), they weren\u8217 t sharing. The Department of Homeland Security, which produced regular intelligence and threat assessments for local law enforcement, had only scant material on white supremacists, all of it vague and ultimately not much help. Local politicians, including the governor, were also in the dark. This is like a Bermuda Triangle of intelligence, Stout thought, incredulous. He reached out to their state partners. \u8220 So you\u8217 re telling us that there\u8217 s nothing? No names we can plug into the automatic license-plate readers? No players with a propensity for violence? No one you have in the system? Nothing?\u8217 \u8217 }

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf3 One of those coming to Gainesville was William Fears, a 31-year-old from Houston. Fears, who online went by variations of the handle Antagonizer, was one of the most dedicated foot soldiers of the alt-right. Countless YouTube videos had captured his progress over the past year as he made his way from protest to protest across several states, flinging Nazi salutes, setting off smoke bombs and, from time to time, attacking people. Fears was also a felon. He had spent six years in prison for aggravated kidnapping in a case involving his ex-girlfriend, and now he had an active warrant for his arrest, after his new girlfriend accused him of assault less than two weeks earlier. On Oct. 18, the night before the event, Fears and a few others from Houston\u8217 s white-nationalist scene got in Fears\u8217 s silver Jeep Patriot for the 14-hour drive. Fears\u8217 s friend Tyler TenBrink, who pleaded guilty to assault in 2014, posted video from their trip on his Facebook page. There were four men, two of them felons, and two nine-millimeter handguns. \u8220 Texans always carry,\u8221  Fears said later.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf3 Gainesville would be Spencer\u8217 s first major public appearance since the violence of the Unite the Right rally two months before, and the city, a progressive enclave in the heart of deep-red north Florida, was on edge. Anticipating chaos, Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency \u8212  prompting Spencer to tweet out an image of his head making its way across the Atlantic toward Florida: \u8220 Hurricane Spencer.\u8221  A few days before the event, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement sent out a small, bound \u8220 threat book\u8221  of about 20 or so figures, most of them openly affiliated with Spencer or with anti-fascist groups, which Stout knew from his own research meant they weren\u8217 t the people to worry about. Anonymous online chatter on sites like 4chan, meanwhile, described armed right-wing militants coming to Gainesville to test Florida\u8217 s Stand Your Ground law. Stout envisioned 20 white supremacists with long guns. We\u8217 re screwed, he thought.}

More than 1,100 state troopers and local cops stood on alert, with another 500 on standby. There were officers posted on rooftops. Police helicopters buzzed the skies. The Florida National Guard had been activated off-site, and a line of armored vehicles sat in reserve. Hundreds of journalists from around the United States and abroad were in attendance, anticipating another Charlottesville.}

Military veterans, including those returning after multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, might be particularly susceptible candidates, they noted, a prediction based on a 2008 F.B.I. assessment that found 203 individuals with military experience who had joined white-supremacist groups since Sept. 11, 2001. It was a tiny number given the overall United States veteran population, which at the time was close to 24 million. It was also a small percentage of the thousands of white supremacists the F.B.I. estimated were active.

That March, the White House froze the $10 million the previous administration had allotted for the grants, pending review.

By the summer of 2017, the media had begun to cover more far-right events, leading more people to show up in protest, which furthered the right\u8217 s victimization narrative, which in turn led to more events and more violence, all of which was packaged into neat selling points for a movement whose actual real-life followers may have been far fewer than they appeared.}

Some of the most ardent fighters, many of them felons, became celebrities in their own right, offered speaking slots at rallies, where their V.I.P. status earned them police protection. The Rise Above Movement, led in part by a gang member who had gone to prison for an attack, turned beat-downs into an art form, which they promoted on YouTube, drawing recruits. Nathan Damigo, a former Marine who was incarcerated for five years for armed robbery, used footage of his punching a young woman in the face during a Berkeley protest as a recruiting video for his white-nationalist organization, Identity Evropa. The Proud Boys went as far as to create an entire culture around gang-style rituals, including initiation beatings.}

The F.B.I. itself was limited in its surveillance capacity (though many left-wing groups argued that this did not prevent the bureau from monitoring their activities), and in the absence of comprehensive federal scrutiny, right-wing activists trawled through left-wing websites, shared photos of leading anti-fascist and racial-justice activists and infiltrated real-life gatherings. In advance of the event, leaked chats documented potential attendees openly advising their comrades to take note of any threats of violence so they could share them with the police. Erroll Southers later remarked on the sophistication of advising their followers not to bring cellphones, and sharing information among small cells of affinity groups: \u8220 From an intelligence perspective, it was very impressive.\u8221 }

The flag featured the Texas lone star against a backdrop of 14 red and white stripes, an allusion to a signature white supremacist slogan addressing their goal of preserving the white race. The star is centered on a large blue sonnerad, or black sun, an ancient symbol favored by white supremacists, who see it as less obvious than, say, a swastika. In recent years, even longtime neo-Nazi groups like the National Socialist Movement have rebranded by dropping the swastika for less \u8220 triggering\u8221  symbols like sonnerads or runes.

There is no central database, no way to share information among all the tiny police departments that feed into the clerk\u8217 s office, which then divvies up crimes among 22 criminal courts, now scattered across the entire county. Basically, he said, unless someone tells him about a guy he\u8217 s prosecuting, he has no clue.}

How come there wasn\u8217 t an officer in Houston watching this? How come he was on nobody\u8217 s radar?\u8221  Houston has an aggressive gang task force whose investigators have deep knowledge of everyone from the street-level drug dealers to the cartel bosses. \u8220 If a fairly high-up guy from MS-13 sneezes, I get a call at 10 p.m.,\u8221  he said.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf3 If Fears were on someone\u8217 s radar, Phanco doubted he would ever get off it. \u8220 But who\u8217 s responsible for keeping track of these alt-right guys in Houston? Nobody. For me the question is, well, how come? If you want to look at these guys as terrorists \u8212  which I think it is when they\u8217 re firing guns out of cars at protesters,\u8221  he noted, \u8220 then the question remains: Who or what will prevent him from committing more crimes? And, from my chair, nobody,\u8221  Phanco said. \u8220 Nobody\u8217 s watching it, nobody\u8217 s tracking it. And that\u8217 s what\u8217 s got me scared.\u8221 }
