The family tree of an Al Qaeda suspect who blew himself up as police were closing in shows several possible connections to international terrorism: His father is a known operative of Al Qaeda, one brother-in-law was a Sept. 11 hijacker, and another is on an F.B.I. list of men plotting an imminent attack.
     Security officials say Sameer Muhammad Ahmed al-Hada, who accidentally exploded a hand grenade after being cornered Wednesday by security forces in a suburb of Sana, the capital, had been under Yemeni surveillance for more than a week. 
His wife, who was captured in the operation, remained jailed today. 
 One of Mr. Hada's brothers-in-law, Khalid al-Mihdhar, was among the five men who crashed American Airlines Flight 77 into the Pentagon. Another, Mustafa Abdulkader Aabed al-Ansari, was one of 17 named in an F.B.I. alert issued on Monday warning of a possible terrorist attack in Yemen or the United States, officials said.
Mr. Hada's family ties to terrorism don't stop there, authorities said. His father, Ahmad Muhammad Ali al-Hada, is known to work for Al Qaeda, one American official said. In addition, Yemeni officials said that one of Mr. Hada's brothers was an explosives expert who was killed in Afghanistan. He was not identified further.
