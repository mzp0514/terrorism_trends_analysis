The Cuban Government used the 1980 Mariel boatlift to send as many as 7,000 spies to the United States, some of whom were ordered to help drug smugglers ''flood'' this country with illegal narcotics, one such spy said today.
The Cuban agent, Mario Estevez Gonzalez, testifying at a United States Senate hearing here, said some of the spies travel freely in small boats between their Communist homeland and the United States.  Mr. Estevez, who has been convicted of drug smuggling, said some agents were in this country for propaganda purposes and others were to create ''chaos'' in the event of war.
MIAMI, April 30 (AP) - The Cuban Government used the 1980 Mariel boatlift to send as many as 7,000 spies to the United States, some of whom were ordered to help drug smugglers ''flood'' this country with illegal narcotics, one such spy said today.
Mr. Estevez, his head covered by a black hood, was one of three heavily guarded witnesses who described illegal activities by Cuba in the United States at a joint hearing of the Senate Drug Enforcement Caucus, a Judiciary subcommittee on security and terrorism and a Foreign Relations subcommittee on hemisphere affairs.
They detailed one scheme by which 23,000 pounds of marijuana and 10 million methaqualone tablets were to be shipped from Cuba to Florida. The smugglers were expected to share the profits with the Cuban Government.
