 The other day FBI director Robert Mueller had to eat his hat. The nation's top cop called editors at The Washington Post and The New York Times and apologized for the Bureau's efforts to obtain phone records of reporters for the papers' operations in Jakarta, Indonesia. That the Bureau sought the records was a serious blow to the credibility of anti-terrorism operations. That it did so by dodging established procedures was an even worse one.
 If this were an isolated incident, then the invasion of privacy might be written off as a rogue operation. To the contrary, it fits a dismaying pattern. Auditors for the Justice Department and the FBI have reported that the Bureau violated privacy laws or internal rules more than a thousand times in issuing "National Security Letters," or requests for information about private citizens. In 2005 alone, the Bureau issued almost 50,000 National Security Letters. From 2003 to 2005 the Bureau made more than 143,000 requests for information about more than 52,000 people. It defies credulity to believe all those individuals have terrorist ties.
 Brandon Mayfield certainly didn't. The FBI arrested the Portland attorney in 2004 and held him for two weeks as a material witness in connection with the Madrid train bombings. The Bureau used powers granted it under the Patriot Act to tap his phone and search his house. No charges were ever brought, and the American taxpayers ended up paying Mayfield $2 million to settle a lawsuit.
 Fighting terrorism is deadly serious business. The Bureau ought to quit wasting its time and American resources chasing after reporters and other people who don't go around planting bombs - and try harder to catch the bad guys who actually do.
