In late July a federal district court agreed with two state courts that the security policy of patting down every fan at Raymond James Stadium was unconstitutional, yet the sports authority won't give it up. To keep its hands-on searches, the authority has appealed the judge's ruling to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
The sports authority should give up this legal fight, even though its bills are being paid by the National Football League.
U.S. District Judge James Whittemore was right when he said there has been no definable threat to Bucs fans and that any physical searches conducted without suspicion violate the state and federal constitutions.
The NFL may have demanded the pat-down policy to protect against terrorism, but as the judge wrote, "a generalized fear of terrorism should not diminish the fundamental Fourth Amendment protection envisioned by our Founding Fathers. Our Constitution requires more."
The Bucs' contract requires the sports authority to provide reasonable security on game days, but pat-downs are not a reasonable first step. Even airports don't require pat-downs unless an alarm is sounded by electronic screening.
If the authorities ever have probable cause to believe Bucs fans are at risk from terrorists, they have the power to initiate searches. But a blanket policy is not right.
Whittemore made the right call. The sports authority should let it be.
