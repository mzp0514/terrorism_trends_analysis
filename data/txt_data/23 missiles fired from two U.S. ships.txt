Baghdad ignoring cease-fire terms 
 
The Clinton administration said its attack on Baghdad was in retaliation for a  plot to assassinate former President Bush, but Iraq has also been at odds with  the United States and its allies over reluctance to comply with gulf war  cease-fire terms. Iraq has been stalling over a number of U.N. resolutions  aimed at destroying its weapons of mass destruction and its ability to produce  them. Only Friday President Clinton warned Iraq that its continuing refusal to  allow United Nations inspectors to monitor missile test sites could have  "quite serious" consequences.
