To the Editor:
In dismissing the Shultz doctrine, which calls for force against terrorists, George Ball says our ''objective should clearly be to correct, or at least mitigate, the fundamental grievances that nourish terrorism'' (Op-Ed, Dec. 16). However, the Shiite extremists who have killed over 300 Americans are politically primitive.
Their terrorism is rooted in the religious perception that the United States is evil incarnate, ''the Great Satan.''
Articulating his own counterterrorism stratagem, Mr. Ball notes that Shiite extremists have received backing from Iran. He proposes the West could impose sanctions on states that sponsor or shelter terrorists. The feasibility of collective Western response aside, Mr. Ball should know it is Syria and not Iran that controls the Lebanese territory where Shiite terror groups are based, and Syria has not been susceptible to U.S. pressure.
Indeed, Syria supported the militias that drove the U.S. Marines from Beirut. Syria is also the Soviet Union's chief ally in the Middle East, and the Russians are unlikely to be interested in curbing anti-American terror.
Mr. Ball's subtle policy of third- party sanctions is a prescription for future Shiite terrorist attacks. It asks us to sit back and shake our heads over the rising stream of American victims.
