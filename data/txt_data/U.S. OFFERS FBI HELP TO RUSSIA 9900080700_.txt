WASHINGTON (AP) - The Clinton administration offered FBI help to Russia for its investigations of a growing money scandal and suspected terrorist bombings, officials said Friday.
FBI Director Louis Freeh promised his agency's full cooperation to Russian investigators who met with him and other U.S. officials in Washington to discuss an alleged money-laundering scheme at the Bank of New York, the State Department said.
And President Clinton issued a statement promising U.S. help fighting terrorism. Moscow and other Russian cities have recently been rocked by a series of unsolved bombings.
"The struggle against terrorism is a long and difficult road but we must not lose our resolve," Clinton said. "America stands ready to work with Russia to protect our citizens from this common threat."
Besides meeting with the FBI, Russian investigators worked with counterparts at the departments of Justice, State and Treasury, and the Federal Reserve.
Russian gangsters are suspected of illegally channeling $ 10 billion through the Bank of New York, the 15th-largest U.S. bank. No charges have been filed.
The State Department said FBI director Freeh also offered "technical and investigative assistance" to the Russian government in its investigation of four apartment building explosions that killed more than 300 people over the past two weeks.
