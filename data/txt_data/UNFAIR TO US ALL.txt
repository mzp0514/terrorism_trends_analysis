I am shocked and dismayed at the choice Sen. John McCain has made for his vice president, Sarah Palin.
What makes this choice so appalling is regardless of which presidential candidate succeeds in his bid, most of us would be reassured our nation would have in place with either ticket people whom we could trust to keep our nation safe in the age of terrorism.
With Gov. Palin chosen as Sen. McCain's vice president, this is no longer the case. She has no foreign policy experience. No national security experience. No national experience. In fact, she governs fewer people in the whole state of Alaska than we have in Allegheny County! How can she possibly understand what life is like in, and the special problems associated with, our major urban centers? How could Sen. McCain entrust, let alone why should we the American people entrust, our nation's safety to the hands of someone so inexperienced? It is unfair to put someone into a position before he or she is ready, unfair to the person and unfair to our nation.
Regardless of how Gov. Palin performs in the campaign, she is simply an unacceptable choice for vice president when Sen. McCain is already 72 years old, a cancer survivor and the oldest person ever to achieve the presidency if he is successful. We are in two wars, and terrorism raises its ugly head daily worldwide. Never before has the old adage "a heartbeat away from the presidency" been more apt.
Sen. McCain should be ashamed to have put political expediency and ambition above the needs of our country.
