To the Editor:
 For a people still suffering from the overwhelming tragedy of the Holocaust to be subjected to the agonies of anti-Semitic terrorist attacks is a nightmare beyond belief.v.e are angered and deeply grieved by the outrages perpetuated against the Jewish people in France - actions that have been tacitly encouraged by the French Government's acceptance and overt encouragement of the P.L.O., which boasts of its campaign of violence and terrorism against the Jews.
Pioneer Women president Frieda Leemon letter deplores recent bombing of Jewish temple in Paris (France)
We mourn those whose lives were so senselessly destroyed. Jews the world over are united with those in France in demanding that the Government of Giscard d'Estaing thoroughly probe charges of fascist infestation of its police force and that it conduct an in-depth investigation of the current anti-Jewish violence, particularly the bombing of the Reform Rue Copernic Temple in Paris. Most important, these murderous attacks must be halted and harrassment of the Jewish community in France must cease.
Until these actions are taken, no Jew, anywhere, can feel secure.  FRIEDA S. LEEMON National President, Pioneer Women New York, Oct. 8, 1980
