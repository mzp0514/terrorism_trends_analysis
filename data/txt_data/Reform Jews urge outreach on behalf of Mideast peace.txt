Leaders of the Reform movement within U.S. Judaism are calling on members  to "reach out" to Muslims and Christians and work with them on behalf of  Middle East peace.
The call came in the form of a resolution adopted Sept. 20 by the executive  committee of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (UAHC).

The resolution called the Israeli-Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  accord signed on the White House lawn "a historic breakthrough."
But it also warned that "spoilers of the peace," including PLO  hardliners, Muslim extremists in Hamas and Israeli right-wingers have "vowed  to destroy the agreement."
Israel, the Reform leaders said, "has taken great risks for peace.
"Its democratically elected government, acting courageously but prudently,  has decided that the risks of the agreement are preferable to the dangers of  the status quo."
The Jewish leaders also welcomed the PLO denunciation of terrorism and  called on the U.S. government to "help assure the success of the agreement by  vigilantly monitoring the compliance of the PLO with the commitments it has  undertaken" and by providing the economic assistance necessary "to make the  Palestinian entity a viable one."
In the outreach portion of the resolution, the UAHC leaders directed its  interreligious affairs department to "reach out to American and Canadian  Muslims and Christians to initiate with them cooperative efforts on behalf of  Middle East peace."
