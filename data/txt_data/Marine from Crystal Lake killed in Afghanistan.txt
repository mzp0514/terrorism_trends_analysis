Body


A 29-year-old decorated Marine from Crystal Lake was killed Sunday while supporting combat operations in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, according to a release from the Department of Defense.
Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Antonik was killed during his fourth military deployment â€” he had been sent twice to Iraq and twice to Afghanistan, said Major Jeff Landis, public affairs officer for Marines Special Operations Command.
Antonik joined the Marine Corps on May 23, 2001, and was trained as a reconnaissance man.
A reconnaissance man belongs to a special, smaller team that deploys independently of a larger unit to collect intelligence or assess combat situations, Landis said.
Antonik was promoted to staff sergeant Feb. 1, 2009. During his career, Antonik received a combat action ribbon, three good conduct medals and a U.S. Navy and Marine Corps achievement medal, Landis said.
According to a news release, Antonik also earned four sea service deployment ribbons, an Afghanistan campaign medal, the global war on terrorism expeditionary medal, the global war on terrorism service medal, two Iraq campaign medals, the national defense service medal and two Navy unit commendations.
Since March 2009, Antonik has been assigned to the 1st Marine Special Operations Battalion out of Camp Pendleton, Calif.
A family member said Antonik's parents were at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Tuesday to claim their son's body. Antonik is also survived by his 26-year-old sister, Jennifer. Funeral arrangements are pending.
