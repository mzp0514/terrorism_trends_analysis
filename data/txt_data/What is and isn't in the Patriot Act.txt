The USA Patriot Act has been blamed for policies that are not included in its 342 pages:
What the Patriot Act does
 * Allows the FBI and the CIA to share evidence.
 * Permits the FBI to ask federal judges on the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court for orders to force businesses to turn over records in terrorism or intelligence probes. To get FISA orders allowing other types of searches and surveillance, agents must show "probable cause" that the subject of such a probe is "an agent of a foreign power." Under the Patriot Act, agents must only say that the business records they want are sought in a terrorism or intelligence probe. Businesses may not tell anyone about such orders.
* Allows prosecutors to ask judges to delay "for a reasonable period" telling people that their homes or offices have been secretly searched in a criminal probe.
 * Allows U.S. agents in terrorism and intelligence probes to get court orders for "roving" wiretaps, which involve surveillance on various electronic devices a subject uses.
What it doesn't do
 * Give the Justice Department power to detain hundreds of Middle Eastern men after the 9/11 attacks. (This was done under immigration laws.)
 * Allow the government to hold 650 suspected Taliban and al-Qaeda operatives at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as "enemy combatants" without access to lawyers or U.S. courts. (President Bush says he can, as commander in chief, hold them as long as the war on terrorism lasts -- in essence, indefinitely. His decision is being challenged in cases before the Supreme Court.)
 * Allow authorities to hold two U.S. citizens as "enemy combatants" at a Navy brig without charges or access to U.S. courts. (Bush imposed this policy, also based on his war powers under the Constitution. The policy is being challenged in cases before the Supreme Court.)
 * Create military tribunals to try non-citizens who are accused of terrorism offenses. (Bush authorized the tribunals in November 2001. The Defense Department is in charge of establishing the rules for the tribunals and running the trials; none has been held so far.)
 * Allow FBI agents to enter houses of worship or attend political rallies while investigating terrorism. (Attorney General John Ashcroft made this possible by changing Justice Department rules for investigators.)
