The price of crude oil briefly jumped above $39 a barrel Thursday in a rally fueled by heating-oil supply concerns and fear of a terrorist attack on the Independence Day weekend.
After hitting $39.10 a barrel, light crude for August delivery settled at $38.74, up 4.6 percent or $1.69, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
On the International Petroleum Exchange in London, Brent crude also gained 4.6 percent to settle at $36.07.
The initial spark for the buying, analysts said, was the upcoming holiday weekend -- a frequent catalyst on energy markets as traders seek to hedge their bets in case of any unforeseen event that could disrupt oil supplies.
"Then it just started feeding on itself," said Edward Silliere, a trader for Energy Merchant LLC in New York. He believes the concerns about heating-oil supplies are being overblown by speculators.
With heating-oil futures 37 percent higher than a year ago, Silliere said refiners have a major incentive to "push their plants to the limits" to produce more heating oil.
Still, heating oil for August delivery soared 5.95 cents, or 6 percent, to $1.08 a gallon on Nymex.
According to Energy Department statistics, nationwide inventories of distillate fuel, which includes diesel and heating oil, are 7.7 million barrels below the 5-year average for this time of year at 110.9 million barrels.
Meanwhile, unleaded gasoline for August delivery rose 5.69 cents, settling at $1.224 a gallon.
