ROME -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and her Italian
colleagues found common ground Sunday on expanding the NATO security
alliance, but wide gaps remained over Italy's trade with such
outlaw nations as Iran and Libya.
Albright said her talks with Prime Minister Romano Prodi and other
top officials reflected the "breadth, depth and vitality" of
Washington's relations with Rome -- the first of nine stops on
her first overseas tour as secretary of State.
"We came to agreement on a whole set of issues, especially NATO
enlargement and the NATO-Russian charter," she said, referring
to a proposal that would establish a special relationship with
Moscow -- upset over NATO plans to expand to the former Soviet
bloc.
But in a joint news conference with Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini, she noted that the two sides were "not in complete agreement"
on issues including:
-- Dealing with countries such as Iran, Iraq and Libya, which
Washington accuses of sponsoring terrorism.
-- "Progress towards democracy" in Cuba, which Washington seeks
to punish through the Helms-Burton Act, a law that imposes penalties
on companies dealing with Cuba.
"We feel very strongly that supporting states that support terrorism
is a real problem for us," Albright said.
About 42% of Italy's oil comes from Iran and Libya. Both are under
U.S. economic sanctions for state-backed terrorism. Albright also
will visit Bonn, Brussels, London, Paris, Moscow, Seoul, Tokyo
and Beijing.
