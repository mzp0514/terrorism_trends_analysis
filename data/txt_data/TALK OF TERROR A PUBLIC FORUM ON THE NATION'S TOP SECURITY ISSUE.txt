It was the biggest news on the terrorism front since 9/11. The discovery and killing of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden only two weeks ago has led to fresh analysis of the global threat of violence against the United States.
The central question now seems to be does the Navy SEALs' covert action in a residential compound in Pakistan change nothing, or does it change everything?
To help Pittsburghers answer that for themselves, PNC Financial Services is presenting a town meeting sponsored by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette called "Terror Watch: The Outlook After Bin Laden." The public event will take place Thursday, May 26, 6:30 to 8:00 p.m., at the Heinz History Center in the city's Strip District.
Four experts on national security will discuss, debate and take questions on what to expect after the demise of bin Laden: Fr. John Sawicki, political science professor at Duquesne University; Cynthia Combs, author of "Terrorism in the Twenty-First Century;" John Walcott, winner of the I.F. Stone Medal for critical reporting on the Bush administration's claims of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq; and Frederic Wehrey, an Air Force veteran and RAND Corporation senior policy analyst on Persian Gulf security, the Middle East and other subjects.
Moderator of the town meeting will be David Shribman, executive editor of the Post-Gazette.
While the event is free to the public, attendees must reserve a seat by calling 412-263-3850 or emailing marketing@post-gazette.com Pittsburghers may never know everything about the threats that lurk, but after this session they'll have a far better understanding of the terror landscape.
