Residents of Atlantic Beach got a new mayor on Monday, as UNF faculty member and retired FBI Special Agent Ellen Glasser took the oath of office. Mayor Glasser and Commissioners Brittany Norris and Candace Kelly were elected Aug. 29 to the Atlantic Beach City Commission.
Glasser won 54 percent of votes in the August election and is set to serve a two-year term as mayor of Atlantic Beach. She had a decorated career with the FBI before working as an instructor at UNF, working on significant cases such as the Iran-Contra investigation and many prominent cases of bank robbery, terrorism, and homicide.
After the September 11 attacks, she was the head of the North Florida Joint Terrorism Task Force. Glasser later served as national president of the Society of Former Special Agents of the FBI.
At Monday's city commission meeting, outgoing Mayor Mitchell Reeves wished Glasser luck on her two-year term. During the meeting, Reeves received several awards for his work during his term, including the "Home Rule Hero" award from the Florida League of Cities, an organization that seeks to preserve autonomy of Florida cities.
After several goodbye addresses, Reeves and several commissioners handed over their power to the new commission. They got to work immediately, opening the floor to comments from the public and then reviewing several resolutions and ordinances.
