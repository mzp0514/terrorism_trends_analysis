TO THE EDITORS:
In his book, "America at the Crossroads" (Yale 2006), political scientist Francis Fukuyama identifies four Islamic groups and gives distinguishing features and objectives of each:
n Islamic fundamentalists act out of religious motives and seek to revive their version of an earlier, purer and stricter form of religious practice, using the Quran as a guide.
n Islamists tend to have political goals and want to bring religion into politics in ways not necessarily hostile to democracy. The Islamist Justice and Development Party in Turkey, which was democratically elected, supports entry in the European Union.
n Radical Islamists, or jihadists like Osama bin Laden, use violence in pursuit of political goals. This radical ideology appeals to alienated people, who, in earlier times, might have gravitated to communism or fascism.
n Ordinary Muslims, the majority, follow a genuine Muslim religiosity embedded in local or national culture and modified by local customs, mores, saints and the like. It is supported by that locale's political authorities.
Ordinary Muslims oppose terrorism and share goals of community, family, alms and submission to God with other religions. These features foster cooperation on disaster relief, refugee care, medical needs and education.
We should differentiate among these four groups when speaking of the Muslim world, out of which jihadism emerges as a separate force. Attributing terrorism to an entire religion or culture obscures differences in global Islam. Clearer terminology became especially important to us, Fukuyama says, after Sept. 11, 2001.
