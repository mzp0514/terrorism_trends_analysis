Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, said today in a television interview that he would not retaliate with an oil embargo for the expulsion by the Reagan Administration of Libyan diplomats in the United States.
''I am sorry to see this childish behavior by the American Government, which is not suitable for a big power,'' said Colonel Qaddafi, whose country supplies 5 percent of United States oil imports.
Libyan leader Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi says he will not retaliate with oil embargo for expulsion of Libyan diplomats in US
He was interviewed by satellite from his office outside Tripoli on ''The MacNeil-Lehrer Report'' on PBS.  The Libyan leader said that 2,000 Americans living in his country, most of whom are employed by American oil companies, would be safe unless ''the situation deteriorates'' because of further United States actions against Libya.
 
Warning to Libya on Terrorism
The expulsion of 26 members of the Libyan diplomatic mission here was described by United States officials as a warning to Libya against support for terrorist groups around the world and for Libya's military intervention in Chad with Soviet-supplied arms.
Colonel Qaddafi denied that Libya had used its oil wealth to finance an attack by Palestinian terrorists on Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympic Games in 1972 or that Libya had provided money or arms for guerrillas in Ireland, El Salvador or Italy.
He said Libyan relations with the Soviet Union were good because Soviet arms sold to his country helped it maintain its defenses against ''enemies.'' But he said that Libya would not allow its territory to be used by the Soviet Union to store arms that could be used against African countries.
