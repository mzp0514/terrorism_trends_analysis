Salih Khater, 29, will appear in court facing a count of attempting to murder members of the public and one count of attempting to murder police officers, following the incident outside the Houses of Parliament on Tuesday.
One man was treated at the scene while another man and a woman were taken to hospital but were discharged by Tuesday evening. Police say that was an attempt to murder police officers.
The apparent terror attack came a year after a man drove his vehicle across Westminster Bridge, struck pedestrians and then stabbed a police officer to death.
Within minutes of Tuesday's morning rush-hour crash, police flooded the streets around Parliament and cordoned off an area of the city that is home to government buildings and tourist attractions including Westminster Abbey.

Everton's revolution under Marco Silva gained more momentum at Goodison with Richarlison scoring his third goal in two games. Chelsea maintained their winning start to the Premier League campaign with a 3-2 victory over Arsenal at Stamford Bridge.
He then crashed into barriers outside the Palace of Westminster and was arrested.
Mr Basu said the force is treating it as a terrorist incident because of its apparently deliberate nature, the method used and the "iconic" location. Five people died, including the officer, and more than 50 were injured.
Khater is due to appear in a London court on Monday.
Prosecutors will be treating his case as terrorism, the Metropolitan Police said after charging him on Saturday.
