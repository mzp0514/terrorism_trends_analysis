An Assistant Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation told the nation's mayors today that the agency was monitoring supporters in the United States of Abu Nidal, Hezbollah and other Middle East terrorist groups that "have the capability to take action."
But the official, William Baker, said that despite an outbreak of terrorism overseas since the Persian Gulf war began, the level of terrorist activity in this country was relatively low.
William S. Sessions, the F.B.I. Director, who also appeared at the United States Conference of Mayors, said, "The bureau feels it is very much in control of the counterterrorism program."
Mr. Baker said the bureau perceived the threat of Iraqi-inspired terrorism in this country as coming from Iraqi diplomats, supporters of international terrorist groups and individual zealots.  "Various terrorist support groups have infrastructures in the United States," he said.
He said the Abu Nidal organization, which has been held responsible for nearly 30 hijackings, assassinations or other violence, had the highest potential for carrying out terrorist attacks.
William H. Webster, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, has privately told friends and former colleagues that the C.I.A. has tracked terrorists leaving Iraq since last August. He said these terrorists were thought to pose a threat only to Americans traveling abroad, not in this country.
