What has been 9/11's biggest impact on you?

What has been 9/11's biggest impact on you? 
"I think that I used to be pretty egotistical about America and I think everyone is -- the biggest, the best, the wealthiest country. ...

How can the nation win the war on terrorism? 
"I think there's always going to be seeds of terrorism. ... No matter what country it is, there's always going to be those rebel groups. When we killed bin Laden, that was a good morale boost. ... I think that's just the beginning. I think Osama has already trained people."

My dad came and picked me up in the middle of the school day, and when we got home I saw everything on the news."

"We really should never let our guard down. The hints and signs were there and yet the attacks happened anyway. We couldn't do anything at that point. They didn't do enough about it initially."

Never in a million years would I have though that could happen." 
What has been 9/11's biggest impact on you:

How can the nation win the war on terrorism: 
"I think we're too deeply involved in too many countries. We put our hands in everything, and it causes problems. If you walk past a bee's nest and swat it, what are the bees going to do?"

All throughout the day, kids were being called to the office because their parents were picking them up. I stayed." 
What has been 9/11's biggest impact on you?

"You hear that for businesses it's been terrible and employment is bad. Money is tight for everyone since then."

What has been 9/11's biggest impact on you? 
"I try not to fly. It's really inconvenient with all the security, but I don't fault the fact that we need to do it. It used to be if the drive was going to be more than three hours, I would fly. Now, if it's more than six hours, I think about flying." 
How can the nation win the war on terrorism? 
"In the States, there's nothing we can do other than be cognizant of what's going on. If somebody wants to do something, they're going to do it. There are so many terrorists out there, the odds are with them."
