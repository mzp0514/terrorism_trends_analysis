A WESTCHESTER County businessman pleaded guilty yesterday to funneling money to a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan.
Abdul Tawala Ibn Ali Alishtari admitted in Manhattan Federal Court that he wired the $152,000 overseas, believing the money would buy night vision goggles for killers in a terror boot camp.
His defense team initially claimed Alishtari was more interested in getting paid by the undercover agent who asked him to make the transfer than in any cause or jihad.
Alishtari had hoped the agent, who passed himself off as a wealthy Middle Easterner, would invest in Flat Electronic Data Interchange, a loan investment program Alishtari was running.
Federal prosecutors have called it a fraud, and Alishtari fessed up yesterday that he also stole from its investors.
"Alishtari today admitted that he stole millions from investors and knowingly financed what he believed to be tools of terror," said U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara.
"In enriching himself, Alishtari displayed a deliberate disregard for the financial and personal security of others," Bharara said.
Alishtari, 53, arrested in 2007, pleaded guilty to terrorism financing and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.
He faces up to 20 years in prison on the terrorism charge and five years on the wire fraud charge. agendar@nydailynews.com
