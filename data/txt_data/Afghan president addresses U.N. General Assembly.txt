UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai wants the international community to strengthen his country's army and police, telling world leaders Wednesday that a more powerful Afghanistan can better fight terrorists. Karzai, though, criticized casualties from foreign bombing raids, saying in an address to the U.N. General Assembly that the deaths can seriously undermine the legitimacy of efforts to fight terrorism. 
U.S.-Afghan relations have suffered over the issue, and Karzai said Wednesday that continuing casualties hurt "the credibility of the Afghan people's partnership with the international community." The issue was propelled to the forefront of U.S.-Afghan relations when an Afghan commission found that an Aug. 22 U.S.-led operation in the western village of Azizabad killed 90 civilians, including 60 children. That finding was backed by a preliminary U.N. report, though the U.S. says it is still investigating. Karzai pushed for giving Afghanistan more power, saying the international community should redouble its efforts to strengthen the Afghan army and police so they can more strongly fight terrorism and protect Afghanistan's people. "Above all, 'Afghanization' of the military operations is vital if the problem of civilian casualties is to be addressed effectively," Karzai said in his speech. His comments come as Taliban attacks grow larger and more deadly. This has been the most violent year in Afghanistan since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion that ousted the Taliban's hard-line Islamist government.
