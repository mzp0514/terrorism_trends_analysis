To the Editor:
Re ''Qatar's Support of Extremists Alienates Allies Near and Far'' (front page, Sept. 8):
Qatar does not fund or support terrorist organizations, and we have taken elaborate steps to block the funding of these groups by private Qatari citizens. We have passed laws to prevent money laundering. We are a member of the Global Counterterrorism Forum, where we coordinate counterterrorism initiatives with 28 other member countries including the United States, Turkey and Saudi Arabia.
In addition, our Ministry of Finance and central bank work with other governments to counter the financing of terrorism. We also collaborate with the United Nations and key foreign governments on numerous sophisticated counterterrorism initiatives.
Yet The New York Times cites the efforts of a ''visiting sheikh'' -- a non-Qatari -- to raise funds for extremist groups in order to suggest that Qatar supports terrorism.
It is true that our ''open door'' foreign policy allows groups of all kinds to speak in our public square, but our government in no way supports the radical groups that are terrorizing innocent citizens and destabilizing the Middle East.
Their actions are evil and abhorrent. Our allies fully understand our position on this issue, and are not alienated.
KHALID AL-ATTIYAH Minister of Foreign Affairs Doha, Qatar, Sept. 9, 2014
