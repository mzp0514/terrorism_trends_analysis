The French antiterrorism police are investigating after 62 pounds of explosives were stolen from a security services bomb disposal depot at Corbas, near Lyon, the police said Friday.
  France's interior minister, Michele Alliot-Marie, said in a statement that the theft stemmed from ''known failings within the site's own security,'' adding that the site chief had been ''immediately suspended'' and a full inquiry ordered.
  One official said that plastic explosives, almost certainly Semtex, had been taken from the depot along with detonators.
  The police said the explosives were found to have ''disappeared'' on Friday, but might have been removed a week ago. 
  The official refused to comment on a newspaper Web site's assertion that the depot was unguarded at the time.
  ''A theft of explosives used by bomb disposal experts to destroy munitions retrieved from former battlefields has taken place on a site adjacent to the supply depot,'' the minister's statement said.
  Detectives in Lyon are investigating along with France's antiterrorism squad. The police described Semtex as a powerful explosive, odorless and practically impossible to detect.
  The episode was another embarrassment for security officials just two weeks after a French special forces soldier accidentally fired live bullets into a crowd, wounding 17,  at a base open day in the country's southwest.
