School board members Monday unanimously agreed that the risk to Seneca Valley schools of becoming a terrorist target is minimal.
 "Given the locale and current atmosphere, what was offered was not to our benefit to purchase," said board member John Mitro after the district voted to let a 30-day offer to buy terrorism insurance expire.
Treasurer Lynn Stewart explained to the board that under the federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, acts of terrorism must be defined by government regulations and carried out by a person acting on behalf of a foreign interest.
 "If a hijacked plane hits the high school, we would be covered," Stewart said, adding, "but I probably wouldn't recommend [buying terrorism insurance]."
 The additional insurance, offered by the Pennsylvania School Boards Association, would have cost the district $4,300 for the 2003-04 school year. The district now pays about $55,000 a year for insurance.
 Stewart pointed out arguments in favor of the insurance -- the cost would have been low, and the government would pay 90 percent of covered losses that exceed the insurer's deductible.
 "However, the risk is small," he said.
 "Other major cities, like Washington, New York and Philadelphia may" find terrorism risk insurance worthwhile, Mitro said. "I'm pleased the board considered it, but we have a country atmosphere here. Terrorism at Seneca Valley isn't likely."
