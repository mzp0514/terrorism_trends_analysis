 In Beavercreek on Thursday, James Fisher, who lives near Almadaoji, said, "I'm extremely shocked that somebody that close to me is thinking about joining a terrorist group like that. In my opinion if they don't want to be here, then why are they here?"
 "But this is kind of scary thinking that someone that close to me is a possible terrorist," he added of Almadaoji.
 Fisher said the of people living at the house: "They kind of keep quiet. I see them, but because of the direction where it's at, I don't have any contact with them."
 Another neighbor, a man named Dan who declined to give his last name, said he saw Beavercreek police at the house on Wednesday.
 "Ten or 12 people over there talking," he said. "I didn't actually see the FBI or anything like that. But Beavercreek police were over there talking to them.
 "Obviously it's really surprising. You hear about this stuff on the news, TV, stuff like that. But when you walk out your front door and you see the police over there, you know it makes you think about it."
 "You don't think it's going to be right here in Beavercreek, Ohio."
