WASHINGTON â€¢ Behind a looming debate whether President Barack Obama should get new authorization to use military force against the terrorist Islamic State group is a fundamental question: How serious is the threat to everyday Americans?
The Obama administration has increasingly sought to portray the overall threat of terrorism, from ISIS and other groups, as less than that from the Nazis during World War II or the Soviets during the Cold War. More significantly, Obama and his surrogates are portraying current threats of climate change and global warming as more pressing. The president himself told the Internet news organization VOX that he agreed that the news media overstate the threat of terrorism.
It is "entirely legitimate" for Americans to be "deeply concerned with ... a bunch of violent, vicious zealots who behead people or randomly shoot a bunch of folks in a deli in Paris," Obama said. "But we also have to attend to a lot of other issues, and we've got to make sure we're right-sizing our approach so that what we do isn't counterproductive."
His surrogates keep reinforcing that message.
On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest declared: "The point that the president is making is that there are many more people on an annual basis who have to confront the direct impact on their lives of climate change, or the spread of disease, than terrorism."
It came on a day in which the White House confirmed the death of American aid worker Kayla Mueller, held captive by ISIS terrorists. Hers was the latest in a string of horrific killings of Americans and residents of other nations - aid workers and journalists, primarily - who followed altruistic impulses to a stretch of Syria and Iraq that may be the most dangerous place on earth.
Some in Congress are pushing back on the White House characterization.
"Clearly, terrorism and the target we are of terrorists and Americans are of terrorists at home and abroad is something that the president should not equate with the focus we should have on global climate change or pandemic disease," Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., who just rejoined the Senate Intelligence Committee after a two-year hiatus, said Wednesday. "Those are not the same level of the immediate focus that the United States has to have on terrorism."
This disagreement is shaping both how the Senate reacts to Obama's request for approval on use of force against ISIS, along with the overall contours of the fight against terrorism over Obama's final 23 months in office. The resolution authorizes the president to use force against ISIS for three years, while banning "enduring offensive ground combat operations."
Blunt and other members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, who receive weekly top-secret security threat briefings, just spent three days meeting with officials in Turkey and Jordan. The meetings came shortly after ISIS put out videos of a Jordanian pilot, captured after his plane was shot down attacking ISIS targets, being burned alive.
"This continuing to deny what this is all about is not helpful," Blunt said of the administration. Leaders around the world, he said, "are really perplexed by the president's unwillingness to recognize what is really going on with this terrorist threat."
Both points are likely to prompt spirited debate in the Senate, where Arizona Republican John McCain has already called the draft too confining on the president's constitutional war-making powers. Blunt said there would be debates over whether three years is long enough (it is designed to make Obama's successor deal with the issue the first year of his or her presidency), and on the definition of "enduring," among other things.
Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the assistant minority leader, said some colleagues worried that the language limiting "enduring offensive ground combat" was too vague to adhere Obama's pledge to avoid another ground war in the region.
"There is hardly any military operation that cannot be characterized as a defensive operation, and those are exempt" under Obama's draft, Durbin said.

Beyond those immediate concerns, he also calls for an increased focus on boosting cybersecurity, combating climate change and promoting gay rights around the world. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)
