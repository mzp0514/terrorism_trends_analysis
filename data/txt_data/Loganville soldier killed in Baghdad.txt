A former Marine who joined the U.S. Army to support his growing family has been killed in Iraq about a year after re-enlisting.
Spc. Cristian Rojas-Gallego, 24, of Loganville was one of three soldiers who died Thursday in Baghdad after an improvised explosive device detonated near their vehicle, the Department of Defense confirmed Monday.
The other dead soldiers are Staff Sgt. Fernando Santos, 29, of San Antonio, and Spc. Eric. D. Salinas, 25, of Houston.
All three were assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, Wash.
Rojas-Gallego joined the Army July 20, 2006, after learning his wife, Megan, was pregnant with their third child, said Eduardo Rojas, one of his three siblings.
The soldier had been unable to make enough money to support his family through the odd jobs he worked after leaving the Marine Corps, his brother said. Rojas-Gallego served four years as a Marine, including three tours in Iraq.
He served in the infantry, having first enlisted at age 19.
The Iraq war interrupted Rojas-Gallego's efforts to earn a high school diploma while a Marine, his brother said.
Rojas-Gallego's awards and decorations include the Army Commendation Medal, Navy-Marine Corps Presidential Unit Citation, Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, Navy Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, and Combat Infantryman Badge.
A funeral is tentatively planned for Wednesday.
