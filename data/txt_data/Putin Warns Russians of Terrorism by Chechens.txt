Acting President Vladimir V. Putin warned Russians today that there was increasing danger of Chechen-organized terrorist attacks.
At a meeting of top police and security officials here, he said that the September bombings had been tied to what was then imminent Russian victory over the rebels in Dagestan, and that with the fighting in Chechnya nearing an end, Russia could expect more terrorism.
"You recall what happened in Moscow, Buinaksk and Volgodonsk when we smashed the bandits' faces in Dagestan," he said, "when they felt how weak they were in direct combat with us." He called on Russia's security services to be vigilant in preventing terrorist acts.
But in Chechnya today, the end of the war remained elusive. Russia claimed that it had the upper hand in fierce street fighting in Grozny, even after rebels demonstrated their freedom of movement by staging surprise attacks from the rear.
Mystery still surrounded the fate of a Russian general who disappeared in Grozny this week. The military said tersely that Maj. Gen. Mikhail Malofeyev was not listed anywhere as having been killed or taken prisoner.
But a Chechen commander asserted that General Malofeyev, who disappeared on Tuesday, had been taken prisoner and was undergoing interrogation.
"Malofeyev is absolutely healthy and is answering investigators' questions," the commander, Baudi Bakuyev, was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
