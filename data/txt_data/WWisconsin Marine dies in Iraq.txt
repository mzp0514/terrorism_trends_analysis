A sergeant from Wisconsin was one of 10 Marines killed by an improvised explosive device on Thursday, authorities said.
Sgt. Andy A. Stevens, 29, of Tomah, was killed in Fallujah, the Department of Defense said in a statement Saturday.
The attack, which injured 11 others, was the deadliest against American troops in four months.
The department said all 10 Marines were assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, I Marine Expeditionary Force, based in Twentynine Palms, Calif.
"Words will never describe accurately the honor, courage and commitment of these fallen Marines and Sailors," said 7th Marine Regiment Col. William Crowe in a statement. "These men did not give their lives in vain, and we will not soon forget our fellow brothers."
Stevens, who joined the Marines in June 1995 and was serving as a scout sniper, deployed to Iraq with his unit in July, the Marine Corps said.
A woman who identified herself as Stevens' sister in Tomah said the family was not prepared to speak to the media.
"The family is in mourning and they wish not to be disturbed right now," said 1st Sgt. Christopher Campbell of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve Center in Madison.
Stevens' father, Allen, lives in Tomah and his mother, Kaye Olson, lives in Maryland Heights, Mo., the corps said.
Stevens' awards include the Combat Action Ribbon, two awards of the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, the Meritorious Unit Commendation, the Navy Unit Commendation, the Korean Defense Service Medal, two awards of the National Defense Service Medal, five Sea Service Deployment Ribbons, the War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and the War on Terrorism Service Medal.
