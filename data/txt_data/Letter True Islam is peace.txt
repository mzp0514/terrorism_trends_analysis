Terrorists have once again used and maligned the name of Islam for their heinous acts of violence. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and the people of France. There is no room for violence and terrorism in Islam. The word “Islam” literally means “peace” and “security.” Therefore, a true Muslim is peaceful and strives to establish peace and harmony in the world. Anyone who perpetrates any form of extremism or terrorism acts against the teachings of Islam.
True Islam teaches that every human being has the right to freedom of speech and religion without the threat of coercion or punishment. This understanding stems directly from the Holy Quran, which declares, “There is no compulsion in religion” (2257). As an American Ahmadi Muslim, I recognize that everyone has a legal right to free speech, but with that right comes a great responsibility. Prophet Muhammad championed free thought and expression.
The worldwide spiritual leader of Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, His Holiness Mirza Masroor Ahmad, has repeatedly condemned all forms of terrorism and extremism. In a press release issued after the horrific attacks in France, the caliph said, “We must all join together to root out all forms of extremism and to encourage mutual understanding and tolerance. From our perspective, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community will spare no effort in our mission to foster a better understanding of the true and peaceful teachings of Islam in the world.”
