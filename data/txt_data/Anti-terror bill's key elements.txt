The Senate bill to combat terrorism would:
-- Make international terrorism a federal crime.
-- Enable federal authorities to more easily deport suspect aliens.
-- Sharply restrict the right of death-row inmates to appeal their sentences to federal courts.
-- Enable federal authorities to use court-approved ''roving wiretaps'' to monitor phones suspected of being used by terrorists.
-- Allow the U.S. military to assist civil authorities in emergencies involving chemical or biological weapons of mass destruction.
-- Permit the State Department to summarily deny entry visas to persons associated with groups suspected of terrorism or to citizens of countries suspected of sponsoring terrorism.
-- Add as many as 1,000 federal agents to investigate suspected terrorists and set up a new FBI counter-terrorism office.
-- Empower the president to identify specific foreign groups as terrorist and ban U.S. citizens from collecting money for or contributing to such groups.
-- Give federal agents greater access to financial records, credit card data, phone logs and hotel stays of suspected terrorists.
-- Increase the statute of limitations for federal gun crimes to five years from three for such offenses as bomb-making, possessing sawed-off shotguns and converting firearms from semiautomatic to fully automatic.
-- Authorize as much as $ 10 million in rewards for information leading to discovery and conviction of terrorists.
-- Increase various penalties for conviction of terrorist crimes.
Correction

Manufacturers of gunpowder will not be required to add chemical tracers, called ''taggants,'' to their product. A story by the Knight-Ridder News Service in yesterday's editions incorrectly stated that the Senate bill to combat terrorism would require addition of the tracers.
