 WASHINGTON - U.S. health officials have identified a contaminant in batches of the blood thinner heparin associated with 19 deaths and are trying to determine how the chemical got into the drug.
 The lots of heparin, whose key ingredient was imported from China, were recalled Feb. 28, and Food and Drug Administration officials said yesterday that no new deaths have been reported since that time.
 Dr. Janet Woodcock, head of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said the contaminant is oversulfated chondroitin sulfate, a chemical that does not occur naturally. Chondroitin sulfate is a natural compound that occurs widely and is used as a dietary supplement, but the oversulfated version has not been studied widely. 
Bush names choice for homeland security post
 WASHINGTON - President Bush yesterday named a veteran prosecutor, Ken Wainstein, as his homeland security adviser.
 From the White House, Wainstein will coordinate efforts "to ensure that we continue to make progress on combating terrorism, securing our borders and strengthening our emergency preparedness," Bush said in a statement yesterday.
 Wainstein now heads the Justice Department's anti-terrorism efforts. He was the chief federal prosecutor for the District of Columbia and the top lawyer at the FBI.
