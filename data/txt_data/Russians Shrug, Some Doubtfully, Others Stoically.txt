MOSCOW -- In Russia, a country where Sept. 11 conspiracy theories have broad appeal, some questioned whether Osama bin Laden had in fact been killed -- or ever existed at all.
''A bearded man, sitting up in the mountains throwing millions of dollars around for terrorist attacks? It's nonsense,'' said a 44-year-old business consultant named Vladislav, who would not give his last name. ''The Americans planned these attacks themselves to win the people's support for an invasion of the Middle East.''
Though the Russian government has frequently linked the fight against Al Qaeda and international terrorism with its own struggle to eliminate a radical Islamist insurgency in the country's North Caucasus region, few here seemed to think Bin Laden's death would diminish the terrorist threat in Russia.
''A person in Russia can still become a victim of radical Islamic terrorism,'' said Yulia Rasina, a 24-year-old medic. ''It does not matter if Bin Laden is alive or dead.''
''Some one will step in to replace him,'' said Igor Yashnikov, 49, a professional circus clown. ''Stalin died, Hitler died, and war did not end. Evil is a difficult thing to eliminate.''
Still, Mr. Yashnikov said he was glad to hear Bin Laden had been killed.
''There will always be monsters,'' he said. ''But the fewer the better.''
