WASHINGTON (AP) - Three countries courted by the United States for a better relationship - Iran, Syria and North Korea - were again branded as sponsors of terrorism by the State Department Monday along with Cuba, Iraq, Libya and Sudan.
A yearly report showed a shift in concern from the Middle East to South Asia, where Afghanistan is a favorite haven for terrorists and Pakistan has backed groups that engage in violence in Kashmir, a territory contested with India.
Michael Sheehan, who runs the department's counterterrorism office, said the Taliban, which controls most of Afghanistan, professes to want good relations with the United States.
But numerous terrorist groups operate on territory Taliban controls, he said at a news conference that coincided with release of the 107-page glossy report.
Among them is the loosely linked al-Qaida organization, headed by Saudi Osama bin Laden. He is accused of masterminding the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. A total of 230 people died.
Meanwhile, the Pakistan government has tolerated terrorists living and moving freely within its territory and supported groups in Kashmir that engage in violence, said the report entitled "Patterns of Global Terrorism 1999."
Pakistan is not branded a sponsor of terrorism, though. Under law, that would prohibit all but humanitarian assistance from the United States.
Cuba, however, is listed again. In 85 words, the government of Fidel Castro is charged with continuing to provide haven to several terrorists and U.S. fugitives. Colombia's two largest terrorist organizations, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the National Liberation Army, maintained a permanent presence on the island, the report said.
The Clinton administration has maintained long-standing sanctions against Cuba and avoided any diplomatic overtures. It also keeps an icy distance from Iraq and Sudan. The U.S. stance toward Libya is under review.
Two Libyans will be tried this week for the deaths of the 270 passengers, crew and residents of Lockerbie, Scotland, when a Pan Am jumbo jet was blown out of the sky in December 1988. Among the victims were 189 Americans aboard the plane.
Sheehan said Libya will remain on the terrorism list. But he also said world sanctions had driven Libya "out of the terrorism business" and its links to terrorism have dropped dramatically since the 1980s.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is weighing whether to revoke a ban on U.S. travel to the North African country.
Iran, Syria and North Korea, all courted for a better relationship with the U.S., were condemned in the report.
It said Iran and Syria have continued to support regional terrorist groups that seek to destroy the U.S. peace campaign in the area.
And yet, President Clinton journeyed to Geneva, Switzerland, this year to urge Syrian President Hafez Assad to resume negotiations with Israel.
And Albright, in a landmark initiative, offered a dialogue to Iran that could lead to a restoration of relations broken after Iranian militants overran the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took its residents hostage. Albright has stressed, though, that the agenda would include U.S. allegations Iran backed terrorists and tried to subvert the peace process.
North Korea is accused in the report of providing haven to Japanese Communist League-Red Army Faction members who participated in the hijacking of a Japanese Airlines flight to North Korea in 1970.
American officials meet regularly with North Korean officials and the United States provided food and arranged for two civilian reactors and energy supplies in a trade-off for North Korea suspending its nuclear weapons program.
The State Department said the number of persons killed or wounded in terrorist attacks fell sharply last year - to 233 killed and 706 wounded from 741 and 5,952, respectively, in 1998.
Albright said the report was "largely heartening," with the number of Americans killed the lowest in seven years.
She also criticized Congressional proposals to cut more than $ 2 billion from Clinton's request for international affairs funds. "These reductions will harm plans to upgrade security and complicate efforts to counter terror," she said.
Pakistan rejected the report as unfair, saying terrorism is a global problem.
"Terrorism is a problem worldwide, one that everyone should be concerned about and one that Pakistan's chief executive is committed to fight against," said Javed Jabbar, a special advisor to Pakistan's military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf.
A statement issued in the Afghan capital of Kabul by the Taliban foreign ministry dismissed the report as biased. "It shows that the United States is ignorant of our history and our religion. Islam forbids terrorism," the statement said.
