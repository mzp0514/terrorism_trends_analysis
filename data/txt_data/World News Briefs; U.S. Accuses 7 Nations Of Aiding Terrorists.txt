The State Department issued its annual report about terrorism around the world today and listed the same seven countries as last year as sponsors of international terrorism.
Despite the recent agreement with Syria to try to curb violence in Lebanon, Syria remains on the list.
Iran is the "premier state sponsor of international terrorism" and is involved deeply in the planning and execution of terrorist acts, the report said. It said that seven Iranian killings of dissidents were confirmed, compared with four in 1994.
Iran also gives varying degrees of assistance to militant Islamic and secular groups from North Africa to Central Asia, the report alleged.
The report also lists Cuba, Iraq, Libya, North Korea and Sudan as sponsors of international terrorism.
The study said the number of fatalities from international terrorism around the world declined from 314 in 1994 to 165 in 1995.
The report said international pressure and sanctions largely contained terrorism by sponsoring nations like Libya and Iraq.
But it said the number of international terrorist acts rose in 1995 from 322 to 440, largely because of a major increase in nonlethal attacks against property in Germany and in Turkey by the Kurdistan Workers Party, a rebel group that has been fighting the Turkish government for years.
