U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit
Hostage Taking Act
United States v. Rodriguez
08-2805-cr
Appealed from the Eastern District of New York
Background: This decision considers appeals taken from June 2008 convictions sentencing the defendants, after a jury trial, for violating the Hostage Taking Act and the Alien Transportation Act. The 1979 International Convention Against the Taking of Hostages, binds the signatories to adopt effective measures for the prevention, prosecution and punishment of all acts of taking hostages as manifestations of international terrorism. The principal issue on this appeal is whether the Hostage Act has been validly applied to defendants who perpetrated an extortion scheme that used brief confinement of a taxi passenger to obtain a somewhat above average taxi fare.
Ruling: The convictions for violating the Hostage Taking Act are reversed, the convictions for violating the Alien Transportation Act are affirmed, and these cases are remanded for resentencing. A scheme to detain a person in order to extort a taxi fare, even an excessive taxi fare, is not a manifestation of international terrorism. That offense requires detaining and continuing to detain a person to compel a third person to do an act as an explicit or implicit condition for the release of the person detained. In the one case, the defendants did not try to compel Perez to pay money to obtain the release of his wife until he arrived at the Monmouth service area. The confinement following the demand for payment lasted at most fifteen minutes.
