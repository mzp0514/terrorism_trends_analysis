ATLANTA - A judge Friday denied a defense request to bar media from a suppression hearing this month in a terrorism case.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Gerrilyn Brill said the media has a First Amendment right to attend hearings in criminal proceedings unless specific findings are made demonstrating that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.
"Defendant's motion does not come close to giving the court grounds to make the specific findings required by the law before a criminal hearing may be closed to the public," Brill said in her order.
On Thursday, terrorism suspect Syed Ahmed's attorney, Jack Martin, filed a motion seeking to have the media barred from a hearing that will address a defense request to suppress statements Ahmed made to law enforcement.
He said the reason for the request is that the government plans to play in court at the hearing a recording of the 12 hours of conversations they had with Ahmed.
"The defendant has the right to closure of a pre-trial hearing, such as a motion to suppress hearing, whenever there is a substantial probability that holding a public hearing to which the media has access could deny the defendant a fair trial and there are no reasonable alternatives to closure," Martin wrote in his motion.
Tom Clyde, an attorney who has represented The Associated Press and other news organizations in the case, said Friday that Brill's decision to keep the hearing open was the right one.
Ahmed, a U.S. citizen, is accused of undergoing training to carry out a "violent jihad."
