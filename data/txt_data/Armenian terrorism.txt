Regarding the article ''From Ankara to Moscow, new phase for Armenian activism,'' May 4: While this article would lead your readers to believe that Armenian terrorism did not exist before 1974, the origins of Armenian terrorism can be traced back to the late 19th century.
In August 1896 Armenian terrorists occupied the Ottoman Bank in Istanbul and issued a series of demands, just as their counterparts did in September 1981 when they occupied the Turkish Consulate in France.
On March 21, 1921, the Ottoman minister of the interior was gunned down in Berlin by an Armenian. Nine months later, a former Ottoman minister of foreign affairs was assassinated in Rome. Barely two months later, two more former officials were murdered by Armenians in Berlin.
To suggest that this current round of Armenian terrorism is isolated is to ignore the thread of continuity from the late 19th century to this day.
To call these acts ''conspiratorial activism'' is not mere euphemism; it condones terrorism. To suggest that Armenian terrorism halted in 1984 is dangerously foolish.
