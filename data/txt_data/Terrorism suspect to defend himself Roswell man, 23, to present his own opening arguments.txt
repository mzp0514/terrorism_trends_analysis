An Atlanta man will present opening arguments this morning for his own trial on terrorism charges.
Ehsanul Islam Sadequee, who is accused of helping overseas terrorists organize a "violent jihad," decided Monday to represent himself in his Atlanta-based federal trial.
Sadequee, 23, and federal prosecutors spent Monday selecting jurors. U.S. District Judge William Duffey said he will swear in the jury this morning and begin hearing opening arguments.
Sadequee is accused of making videos of potential targets in and near Washington, including the World Bank, the Capitol and the Masonic Temple in Alexandria, Va. He sent the videos to a terrorist based in London, according to a federal indictment.
Prosecutors said Sadequee also took a Greyhound bus in 2005 to Canada, where he met with several suspected terrorists and talked about attacking oil refineries.
Despite Sadequee's dismissal, defense attorney Don Samuel sat with him throughout jury selection Monday and offered advice. Samuel, who said he is stand-by counsel, told the judge that Sadequee did not understand what it meant to represent himself.
The judge refused to hear the attorney's arguments and said he told Sadequee many times what it meant to represent himself.
Sadequee has pleaded not guilty. If convicted, Sadequee could be sentenced to more than 20 years in prison, lawyers said.
Sadequee was born in Virginia and grew up in Roswell after his family immigrated from Bangladesh. He was arrested in 2006 in Bangladesh and spent three years in solitary confinement awaiting trial, his family said.
