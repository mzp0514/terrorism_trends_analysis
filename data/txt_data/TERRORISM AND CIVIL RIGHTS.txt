The International Spy Museum in Washington, D.C., lends its expertise to a new exhibit at the Illinois Holocaust Museum & Education Center in Skokie, Ill. "Spies, Traitors and Saboteurs: Fear and Freedom in America" looks at how the United States seeks to maintain civil liberties and individual rights during times of conflict and crisis.
The exhibit at the museum, 9603 Woods Dr., offers stories of espionage, treason and deception that have played out in America since its beginning - a topic again at the forefront since terrorists struck on U.S. soil on Sept. 11, 2001.

Taking up space
Another museum exhibit takes visitors to a completely different place - outer space.
"The Universe: A Walk through Space and Time" opened on Friday at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, 1300 S. Lake Shore Dr., and features interactive displays that delve into some of our most vexing questions: How big is the universe? How did it begin? Are we alone in it? The exhibit pairs with Adler's Grainger Sky Theater showing of "Welcome to the Universe" to offer an experience the planetarium is billing as "Summer of the Universe."
Multimedia displays in the exhibit explain the formation of stars, planets and galaxies, and touch screens allow guests to investigate deep space.
"The Universe" is presented in the Adler's newly renovated Pritzker Hall of Cosmology. For details on the exhibit and visiting the museum, check adlerplanetarium.org.
