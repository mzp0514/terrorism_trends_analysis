To the Editor:
  Re ''Two Prisons, Similar Issues for President'' (front page, Jan. 27):
  The dilemma of what to do about the prisons at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and on the air base at Bagram in Afghanistan is a symptom of the larger problem of conducting a war on terrorism. The war is without a defined goal and has no measure of success. 
  The United States can kill Iraqis and imprison those captured in battle, but as long as it continues to keep the war going, there will be no reduction in new terrorists. 
  To reduce the number of prisoners at Guantanamo and Bagram, the United States needs to end the invasion, to fire no more guns. The Dick Cheney approach to fighting terrorism by force has to stop. It leads to more killing, retribution and resistance to America. 
  As long as the United States is the invading, killing force, the prisons will continue to fill up and the prisoners will forever be our enemies. Seven years of battle have shown that there is no possibility of victory to be won with guns. 
  The solution is to stop sending prisoners and begin to give the people the promise of a better life, with more reconstruction, schools and commerce.
