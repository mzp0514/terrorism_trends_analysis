To the Editor:
One hesitates before criticizing the views of so distinguished a historian as Henry Steele Commager. However, ''Nations Aren't Innocent'' (Op-Ed, June 27), in which he says terrorism has been practiced by most of the great powers over the past century, is a disservice to clear thinking about modern terrorism.
Letter by Arieh Eilan questions contention by Henry Steele Commager in June 27 Op-Ed article that terrorism has been practiced by most of the great powers over past century
Professor Commager seems to disregard the obvious: all terrorism is violent, but not all violence is terrorist. Terrorism has come to denote only one kind of violence - perpetrated sporadically by organizations and individuals who believe in coercive intimidation to further political or religious goals.
In the last three decades, because of technological advances, terrorism can operate in a manner that protects the perpetrator from detection and punishment; such as leaving a plastic explosive in a supermarket or introducing a time bomb into luggage carried by an airplane.
Perpetrating atrocities is not the sole preserve of terrorists. Tamerlane, who massacred 20,000 in Baghdad in 1401, was remembered as a mass murderer but was not a terrorist; nor for that matter were Stalin and Hitler, who caused the murder of millions. All of them employed terror and were morally even more reprehensible than the average terrorist, but they were not of the same ilk. Nobody understood it better than Lenin, who advocated and employed violence to achieve his aims but resolutely opposed terrorism.
Obliterating political distinctions as Professor Commager does, in self-accusatory, moralistic generalizations is not conducive to understanding terrorism and learning how to cope with this very serious threat to our freedom.ARIEH EILAN Stamford, Conn., June 30, 1985
