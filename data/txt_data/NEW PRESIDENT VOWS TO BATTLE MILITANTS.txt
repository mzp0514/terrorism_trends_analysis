Atwo-year Islamic uprising against Algeria's army-backed regime has killed 3,000 people in the northwest African nation, with many more being threatened unless the government and militant Muslims can come to a peace agreement.
Lamine Zeroual took office as president last week and vowed to keep fighting militant Muslims while also offering talks on ending the rebellion.
This is how the war started:
In January of 1992, an army coup blocked an expected victory by Islamic fundamentalists in Algeria's first multiparty parliament elections. The government also canceled all non-religious activities at Algeria's 10,000 mosques.
Unrest has persisted despite curfews, army sweeps and trials in secretive anti-terrorism courts.
The French Foreign Ministry condemned the slaying and renewed its warnings to French citizens still in Algeria. Thousands have returned to France, Algeria's former colonial ruler.
Twenty-seven foreigners have been slain since militant Muslims declared last year that foreigners would be targets.
The Armed Islamic Group, considered the most radical of a handful of radical groups, warned foreigners in November to leave Algeria or risk death.
Muslim militants have targeted foreigners partly because their skills and investment are vital to the economy. They also have attacked Algerian intellectuals and journalists.
