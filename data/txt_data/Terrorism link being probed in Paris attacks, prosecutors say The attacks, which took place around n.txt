French prosecutors are treating a knife attack near the former offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris as a possible terrorist incident, authorities said on Friday.The attacks, which took place around noon on Rue Nicolas Appert, left two journalists injured, French Prime Minister Jean Castex told press, adding that the victims' lives are not in danger.One of those injured was an employee of Premieres Lignes, a production company.The production company had helped produce a documentary about the attacks on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo editorial team titled "Three Days Of Terror: The Charlie Hebdo Attacks."The documentary, in which witnesses, police officers and survivors speak about the series of terrorist attacks in January 2015, was produced for the US broadcaster HBO, the BBC and French broadcaster France 2.The office of Premieres Lignes is in the immediate vicinity of the former Charlie Hebdo editorial office, which moved to a secret location after the attack.One of the agency's bosses, Luc Hermann, told broadcaster BFM TV that Friday's attack was very traumatic for his company but also for all companies in the building.He heard screams in the street, so he and other staff locked themselves in, he added.The stabbing victims are a man and a woman, Hermann said, adding that they are "committed and remarkable employees."Two suspects have been detained, one near the Place de la Bastille and the other in the area of the Richard-Lenoir metro station near the crime scene, several French media reported.One of those detained is the main suspect, according to the public prosecutor's office.The main suspect is an 18-year-old who was born in Pakistan, and the second suspect is 33 years old, according to local media reports. 
The public prosecutor's office did not provide any details about this.There was a raid in Val-d'Oise in the greater Paris area, according to Franceinfo channel, which reported that the main suspect had been living there.It was not clear what motivated the attack, though anti-terror investigators said they have taken over the investigation.Police urged residents of the city's 11th district to stay indoors for the time being. A dpa reporter who attempted to reach the scene found the entire neighborhood blocked off with police tape.Meanwhile, Castex said he had called a crisis meeting and emphasized his determination to fight terror.Speaking at the crime scene, he spoke of a "symbolic place" and expressed his solidarity with the victims' families and all their colleagues.The Charlie Hebdo editorial staff also expressed their sympathy, saying: "The entire Charlie team supports its former neighbors and colleagues and is in solidarity with them."European Council President Charles Michel condemned the attack on Twitter and expressed his solidarity with the French people."All my thoughts go to the victims of this cowardly act of violence," he wrote. "Terror does not have any place on European territory."Words of sympathy also came from Italy."Solidarity with #France for the vile attack near the former offices of #CharlieHebdo. We are close to the French people and we are following events with concern. Italy stands alongside those who fight against all forms of violence," Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said in a tweet.In France, the risk of terror attacks is still assessed as very high.A trial is underway in Paris for 14 people who allegedly provided aid to attackers who stormed Charlie Hebdo's offices on Jan. 7, 2015, leaving 12 dead. In all, 17 people died at the hands of three attackers during a week of terror in the city.The publication recently reprinted caricatures of the Muslim prophet Mohammed deemed offensive in large parts of the Muslim world and has once again been receiving threats.
