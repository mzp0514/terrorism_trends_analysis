 Senators oppose jet transfer to Anchorage
 Alaska's two U.S. senators have introduced a bill that would forbid the Air Force from transferring F-16s from Eielson Air Force Base near Fairbanks. 
 The Air Force on Friday proposed moving its 21 F-16 fighter jets from Eielson to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage in fiscal year 2013, prompting fears the Fairbanks base would be a target for future closure or realignment. 
 The proposed legislation from Sens. Mark Begich and Lisa Murkowski would also require the Air Force to have the same number of F-16s or more at Eielson this September, when fiscal year 2013 starts. 
 The senators, along with Rep. Don Young, plan to discuss the transfer with Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Norton Schwartz at a Thursday meeting.

 North Pole man is  accused of extortion 
 Alaska authorities say a 36-year-old North Pole man is accused of trying to extort money from the state of Alaska in exchange for not committing acts of terrorism. 
 Troopers say Stanislaus Grzeskowiak was arrested Friday after he contacted troopers in Fairbanks and tried to extort $85,000 for committing acts he believed would affect the University of Alaska, oil companies, cellphone companies, credit card companies and troopers' ability to conduct day-to-day operations. 
 Court records show he is charged with extortion and threatening harm. 
 He is in custody at the Fairbanks Correctional Center, which says he is being held on $2,500 bail and can only be released to a court-approved third party custodian. 
 It's unclear if he has an attorney.
