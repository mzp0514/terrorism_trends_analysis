An appeals court in San Francisco on Wednesday threw out a convicted terrorist's lawsuit accusing a high-ranking Bush administration lawyer who wrote the so-called torture memos of authorizing illegally harsh treatment of ''enemy combatants.'' The lawyer, John Yoo, above, a former deputy assistant attorney general, is protected from such lawsuits because the law defining torture and the treatment of enemy combatants was unsettled in the two years after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, when the memos were written, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit said. The memos have been embroiled in national security politics for years after laying out a broad interpretation of executive power. Most notoriously, Mr. Yoo was the principal author of a memo sent to the C.I.A. in August 2002 authorizing waterboarding, a practice. President Obama banned in 2009. The unanimous ruling of the three-judge panel reversed a lower court decision allowing the lawsuit by Jose Padilla to go forward. Mr. Padilla, serving a 17-year sentence on terrorism charges, was arrested in 2002 and charged with conspiring to detonate a radioactive dirty bomb. President George W. Bush deemed him an enemy combatant, and he was held in military custody for nearly four years.
