New Zealand police charged Brenton Harrison Tarrant with one count of engaging in a terrorist act.
In addition to the terror charge, Brenton Tarrant also faces 51 charges of murder and 40 of attempted murder over the March 15 attacks.
The Muslim-hating white-supremacist behind February's deadly shooting rampage in two New Zealand mosques was formally charged with terrorism early Tuesday.
As the case is before the courts no further commentary will be made by police, Crown Law or the Christchurch Crown Solicitors office on the charges, Bush said.
He stormed the mosques with a number of high-powered weapons and live-streamed the attack online, in what is alleged to be the single-worst terrorist attack carried out by an Australian.
The attack was the deadliest mass shooting attack in New Zealand.

Season 8 is now averaging 44.2 million viewers in gross audience, which marks an increase of more than 10 million. While the series finale drew mixed reviews from critics, its commercial dominance was not in dispute.
Tarrant's lawyer did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment.
"The terrorism act charge is about recognizing the harm to the community and the harmed individuals who were present but who weren't physically injured or killed", Graeme Edgeler, a barrister and legal commentator.
Police met with more than 200 people, including survivors of the 15 March Christchurch attack and the families of victims to inform them of the new charges.
The next court appearance is scheduled for June 14.
"It will cement in people's minds that terrorism has no race or religion", he told Reuters in a Whatsapp message.
