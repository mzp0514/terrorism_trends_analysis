WASHINGTON (AP) - The administration of President George Bush will consider returning Iraq to its list of countries that sponsor international terrorism, Secretary of State James A. Baker III told Congress on Tuesday.  Baker said Iraq's efforts to develop a nuclear program were ''particularly disturbing.''
Iraq was removed from the list in 1984.  ''I think we have to take a look at this issue, and we will be taking a look at this issue,'' Baker told a Senate appropriations subcommittee a day after the State Department's annual report to Congress on terrorism.  That report cited six nations for sponsoring international terrorism, including Syria and Iran. Those two nations won praise Monday from Bush for their help in the release of American hostage Frank H. Reed in Lebanon.  Countries on the list are denied advanced American technology and U.S.  support for various international bank loans. In addition to Syria and Iran, the list includes Libya, Cuba, North Korea and South Yemen.  Sen. Bob Kasten, R-Wis., told Baker that whatever the administration's decision, he would promote legislation in Congress to put Iraq on the terrorism list.  Baker said the administration was considering several sanctions against the Iraqi government, including a denial of credits for agricultural purchases.  But he cautioned, ''We ought to be at least conscious if we take that action, our allies will be very quick to pick up our market there.'' The State Department terrorism report credited Syria and Libya with showing some improvement. The report also said Iran had shown a slight decline - to 28 incidents of supporting terrorism last year from 32 in 1988.
