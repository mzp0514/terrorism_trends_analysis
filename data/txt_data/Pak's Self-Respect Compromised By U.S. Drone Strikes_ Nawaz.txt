(RTTNews) - Stating that the U.S. drone strikes inside Pakistan compromised Islamabad&apos;s "self-reliance and self-respect," Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) chief and former two-time Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif Tuesday said no sovereign country will tolerate such attacks, reports say.
"Other countries should respect our sovereignty just as we respect others," Sharif, who was in Dubai for a four-day private visit, said in an indirect reference to the U.S.
He said that despite political disagreements, his party never asked for mid-term elections in Pakistan and it would not do so in the future. "We need to respect each other&apos;s mandate in Pakistan," Sharif said, adding that the political situation in the country deteriorated because democracy was derailed and the constitution was not respected.
Attributing the rise of terrorism to the legacy of dictatorships, he said Islamabad should take the responsibility on its own to solve the problems of extremism and terrorism but the solution has to be home grown.
Sharif also said there are still outstanding issues with the present government despite the restoration of judges.
On Kashmir, he said peace in the region couldn&apos;t be achieved without the resolution of the problem of Kashmir.
"This will happen only when the decision is acceptable to the people of Kashmir. India and Pakistan should find a solution that fulfils the aspirations of the Kashmiri people," he added.
