A COALITION DOES NO GOOD IF SOME TERRORISTS GO FREE;
The United States shouldn't compromise on its goal of ridding the world of terrorism to please certain allies.

Already, American resolve following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks is threatened.
The threat doesn't come from that small minority of U.S. citizens who cannot fathom war on any terms.
Rather, it comes from abroad, from friends new and old.
The European Union has carefully circumscribed its support for the U.S. war on terrorism, with declarations directed against only the perpetrators of the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.
Perhaps more concerning, however, is the influence of some Arab nations. They, too, have joined the cause against the Sept. 11 attackers, but an all-out war against all organizations that employ terrorism is well past where these allies seem to want to go.
This is not surprising and wouldn't be alarming, except that it has already had an effect on the Bush administration.
In taking the war on terrorism to the financial markets, the president ordered the assets of a number of suspected organizations frozen, and said those who do business with these groups or individuals can't do business here. Conspicuously missing from the list were three groups regarded as terrorists by the United States: Hamas, Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad.
They've been left out because it could upset Arab members of the coalition Bush is trying to build.
When the United States tried in the 1970s and 1980s to distinguish between good oppressive dictators and bad ones in Latin America, the policy was seen rightly by many as self-serving and morally bankrupt. Likewise, there are no good terrorists, and states that don't abide by that principle are of little use in any coalition.
