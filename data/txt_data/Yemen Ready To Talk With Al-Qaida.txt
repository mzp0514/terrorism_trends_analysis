(RTTNews) - Yemen is ready to talk with leaders of al-Qaida if the latter laid down its weapons and renounced violence. This came in the background of Al-Qaida leaders saying that several of its operatives, including some Saudis and Egyptians, were coming from Afghanistan to fight alongside those in the lawless tribal lands in central and southern Yemen.
"We are ready to reach an understanding with anyone who renounces violence and terrorism," including al-Qaida, said Yemen President Ali Abdullah Saleh. He further told Abu Dhabi television in an interview aired late Sunday, that his country&apos;s security and armed forces would track down as many al-Qaida militants who refused to lay down arms and renounce terrorism as needed.
Dialogue was "the best way" even with Al-Qaida in the Arabian peninsula--the affiliate that has claimed responsibility for the failed Christmas Day bomb plot aboard Detroit-bound Northwest Airlines Flight 253, Saleh said. But if the group continued "sabotage and terrorist acts," he cautioned, his government was "determined to stand up to the challenges."
His comments came as U.S. President Barack Obama reiterated that he had no plans presently to send troops to Yemen in response to concerns that the terrorist network&apos;s presence became more dangerous in that country.
The U.S. says the al-Qaida offshoot in Yemen has become a global threat after a Nigerian al-Qaida suspect attempted to blow up a a Christmas Day U.S. flight to Detroit.
