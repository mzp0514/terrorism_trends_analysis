The Treasury department, which has been focusing on the issue of terrorism insurance for months, still can't say definitively whether an attack on American interests during a military confrontation with Iraq would be considered an act of terrorism or simply an extension of the war.
Peter Fisher, under secretary of the Treasury and one of the officials in charge of implementing the new terrorism law, was in New York yesterday and declined to give a definitive answer on whether such an act would be covered.
"The definition in the act focuses on a terrorist act by a foreign source," Mr. Fisher said to a room of insurance industry executives at the WCBF conference on "Successfully Managing Terrorism Insurance Risk." An attack during a war with Iraq "might pose a hard question," he said.
The question is a sticky one because, as a rule, war and nuclear attacks are excluded from insurance policies. Since the passage of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of last year, it is illegal to exclude terrorism from insurance policies.
Mr. Fisher said the Treasury department was working to clarify its position on nuclear and chemical attacks as well. He said it was "core issue," but declined to provide details on the department's position.
The federal act defines terrorism, for insurance purposes, as any act "certified" by the secretary of the Treasury, secretary of state, and the attorney general and must be committed by a foreign source. Yet what "certified" means, exactly, is still unclear. Mr. Fisher declined to say when the department would be able to shed some light on the various guidelines presented in the act.
