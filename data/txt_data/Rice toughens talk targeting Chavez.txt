BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) - Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Thursday that all U.N. nations, including Venezuela, have an obligation to go after terrorists and keep them from operating within their borders.
The comment was largely a warning shot for Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who U.S. officials suspect has lent support to Colombian rebels. In recent days, Rice and President Bush have sharpened their rhetoric against Chavez while at the same time praising Colombia and other Latin American allies in a bid to isolate the Venezuelan leader and bolster alliances.
Asked whether the U.S. was seriously considering designating Venezuela as a state sponsor of terrorism, Rice said the U.S. was ready to respond if necessary.
"There is after all a U.N. obligation that all states have undertaken to do everything that they can to prevent terrorists from actively using their territory, from being engaged in terrorist financing," Rice told reporters after a meeting with Brazilian leaders during a two-day trip to the region. "These are obligations that all responsible states have taken and we expect responsible states to live up to those obligations."
Labeling Chavez a terrorism ally, unless absolutely necessary, also could embolden his confrontational style, increase tension in the region and complicate trade matters, U.S. officials fear.
