(RTTNews) - U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan arrived in New Delhi Sunday for talks with Indian officials, who are likely to press Washington to stop military funding to Islamabad, media reports said.
Holbrooke, who is visiting the region to study the latest situation to enable Washington to shape its policy towards these two countries, is expected to brief Indian leaders on his visit to Pakistan and his talks with Afghan President Hamid Karzai.
India&apos;s strong stand that there can be no half measures in fighting terrorism emanating from Pakistani soil will be conveyed to visiting the U.S. envoy. New Delhi is of the view that pressure on Islamabad must be stepped up and military aid also stopped until it dismantles the infrastructure of terrorism from its soil.
These messages will be conveyed during Holbrooke&apos;s meetings with External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee and National Security Adviser M.K. Narayanan.
The U.S. has made it clear that Kashmir is not on the agenda of Holbrooke&apos;s visit and would not be discussed, allaying New Delhi&apos;s concerns that the U.S. could try mediation between India and Pakistan on the issue.
Holbrooke would report to the Secretary of State and the U.S. President once he is back from the region.
