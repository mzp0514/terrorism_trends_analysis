All the talk of terrorism and bioterrorism has left many people feeling anxious and even depressed, but one group that's especially vulnerable is the elderly, experts say.
Some older people have spent an inordinate amount of time watching television since the Sept. 11 attacks, hoping for a little bit of solace, resolution or control ---- even though these things may be a long way off, says Joe Luciani, a clinical psychologist in Cresskill, N.J., who works with some elderly people.
"It's too much saturation right now. If you're not sharing the information with someone and getting some perspective, it can echo in your head and create an anxious or depressive condition," says Luciani, author of Self-Coaching: How to Heal Anxiety and Depression.
Younger families often have other distractions to keep them occupied, he says. "We can hop in the car, watch our kids at a track meet, go to a ball game. We step out of the saturation."
But some older people don't have those same outlets. He recommends they turn off the TV and find other things to do. His ideas: Visit grandchildren or family, go for a walk in the park, take a drive, go to the community center, have lunch with friends, phone family.
He also suggests that younger people help older ones, especially those who are shut in. "We need to reach out more to those elderly among us."
