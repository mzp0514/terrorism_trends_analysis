The NYPD's new weapon against terrorism has one name, four legs, doesn't understand English and will turn 6  Monday.
 But make no mistake: Franky, a German shepherd bred in Holland, is a key part of the effort to keep New Yorkers and tourists safe at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, his snout capable of picking up on the scent of explosives up to a couple of hundred feet away.
 "This dog picks up a scent of an explosive and (the officer's) got to watch his shoulder doesn't come out because this dog is in pursuit of that scent," Chief of Counterterrorism James Waters said Wednesday as the NYPD discussed its security measures for the parade and for the balloon inflation the night before.
 Last year, Waters said, members of his bureau traveled to a police dog training center in Florida and were impressed with the explosive odor-pursuit dogs, as they are called. "That's nice," Waters said. "But I said bring one of those dogs and the handler (here) and let's see if he can work in New York City."
 The dog passed with flying colors, twice picking up on a scent during a test in Times Square. So, the New York City Police Foundation bought four dogs, including Franky, who's named after Officer Francis La Sala, who died in January 1987, after he was badly burned trying to rescue residents from a burning Manhattan building.
