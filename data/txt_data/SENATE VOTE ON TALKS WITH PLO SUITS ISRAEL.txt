JERUSALEM ISRAEL WELCOMED on Friday a vote by the U.S. Senate that could lead to restricted contacts between the U.S. government and the PLO, although the measure approved was a watered-down version of the proposal.  Foreign Minister Moshe Arens described as ''a step in the right direction'' the move that would bar U.S. officials from meeting PLO representatives accused by the president of being involved in incidents resulting in deaths of U.S. citizens.
The PLO, saying the measure had no teeth, also expressed approval of the Senate action.  ''In other words, nothing. . . . That's good,'' Palestine Liberation Organization spokesman Ahmed Abderrahman said in Tunis, Tunisia, on hearing of the compromise text.  The Senate rejected on Thursday a proposal by Sen. Jesse Helms, R.-N.C., that would have barred U.S. talks with any PLO official who had prior knowledge of or took part in an attack that resulted in the death, injury or kidnapping of a U.S. citizen.  Instead it approved a text barring talks with any PLO envoy ''if the president knows and advises Congress'' of his role in terrorism against Americans.  Israel has been campaigning to halt the U.S. talks with the PLO, which began last December after PLO chairman Yasser Arafat renounced terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist.  Helms proposed his measure after the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, Robert Pelletreau, met a deputy for Arafat, Salah Khalaf, who has been accused of involvement in the killing of the U.S. ambassador to Sudan, Cleo Noel, in 1973.  Khalaf, also known as Abu Iyad, founded the Black September group that killed 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich.
