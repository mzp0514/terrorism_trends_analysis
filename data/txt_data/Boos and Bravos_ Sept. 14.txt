Bravo to the increase in Hispanic students enrolled in college. Cronkite News reported via a Pew Hispanic Center analysis that for the first time, two million Hispanic students, ages 18 to 24, are enrolled in college. Bravo to an increase in diversity on college campuses and to seeing more students choose higher-level education.
Boo terrorism. American ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three Americans were killed in a terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya. According to NBC News, four individuals have been arrested and are being held for interrogation. In spite of the horrific events, pictures of Benghazis apologizing to Americans have been spotted all over the Internet. They hold signs such as, "Thugs and killers don't represent Benghazi nor Islam."
Boo to GoDaddy.com servers being taken down and millions of its hosted sites going offline. A hacker has taken credit for the outage and is apparently a member of a larger hacking network that targets supporters of the halted Stop Online Piracy Act. In a tweet by a user from Charter Marketing, reported by The Washington Post, "you got your press, now put it back so we can get back to work."
Bravo to Gilbert Public Schools for refusing to bring back non-denominational prayer. The school board currently begins every board meeting with a moment of silence, followed by the pledge of allegiance. We applaud Gilbert Public Schools for taking steps to ensure religious freedom for all of Gilbert's citizens.
