(RTTNews) - In a gesture of increasing cooperation on counter-terrorism, Canada has offered India its know-how in strengthening the country&apos;s law enforcement agencies to meet threat posed by cross-border terrorism and explore ways to enhance cooperation between the security agencies of both the nations.
Alok Mukherjee, first ever Indo-Canadian to be appointed as the Chief of the Toronto Police Service Board, said Ottawa could assist New Delhi in raising special security forces to prevent terrorist attacks and counter them with speed and decisiveness.
Mukherjee, who will be visiting India next week along with Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair on an invitation from the Indian government, said the Toronto police was successful in curbing anti-India and the LTTE activities using "Intelligent Policing" tools.
"The thrust of intelligent policing is to increase effectiveness and better risk management even with limited resources," he added.
The Toronto Police Services Board voted last month to send Mukherjee to India, but not with $4,500 in donations from two companies to help cover the costs of the trip.
Fellow board member Judi Cohen said after the vote that in principle, he agreed with Mukherjee&apos;s trip to India, saying: "We live in a diverse community. I think we should be reaching out. I think we should be sharing our knowledge and our experience, but in a planned way."
