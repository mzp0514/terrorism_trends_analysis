Iowa has spent at least $$ @2.6 million on homeland security since Sept. 11, but the federal government will pick up some of the tab, according to a copyright story in The Des Moines Register. 
The Iowa National Guard has spent about $$ @1.9 million so far on security duties within the state, according to a Register survey of state expenses. The federal government will pick up most of that cost. 
As many as 620 soldiers have provided protection for armories, Camp Dodge and other military installations at a cost of $$ @1.5 million. 
The cost of deploying 78 soldiers to help protect travelers at eight Iowa airports has reached nearly $$ @300,000. 
More than $$ @88,000 was spent on guards at the University of Iowa Hygienic Laboratory in Oakdale, ordered by Gov. Tom Vilsack amid rumors of anthrax being stolen from an Iowa lab. The rumors proved false. 
At the Iowa Capitol, a $$ @300,000 card-lock system will limit building access after hours. Proposals to set up visitor checkpoints during the day, complete with metal detectors and X-ray machines, could cost $$ @550,000 or more. 
"We've already had people cancel trips because they don't feel safe in the building," said Iowa Senate President Mary Kramer, a West Des Moines Republican.
Just how much reimbursement the state can expect from federal anti-terrorism funds is uncertain.
The anthrax scare forced some state employees to work overtime. The Iowa Department of Public Health ran up a $$ @50,000 tab paying workers to investigate anthrax calls and update disaster response plans. Another $$ @55,000 was spent to educate health-care providers about the warning signs of anthrax and smallpox. 
"We're doing it with the resources we've got, and that means other things aren't getting done. But this is obviously a priority," said Dr. Patricia Quinlisk, the state epidemiologist.
The Iowa Hygienic Laboratory tested dozens of samples of suspicious material during the anthrax scare. Mary Gilchrist, the lab's director, wants a $$ @300,000 increase in the lab budget to add staff and buy equipment to analyze substances. 
The Iowa Department of Public Safety costs exceed $$ @56,000. They include $$ @21,000 spent on intelligence work by the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation, keeping track of people with suspected links to terrorist activities and checking out facilities such as power plants that could be targets of an attack. 
Even small agencies have incurred security costs. The Department for the Blind spent about $$ @3,500 on such things as exit door alarms, two-way radios and upgraded mailroom doors. 
No statewide figures are available for homeland security expenses of Iowa airports and local governments, but Des Moines offers some examples.
Extra airport protection provided by Des Moines police costs the airport about $$ @55,000 a month, said aviation director Bill Flannery. 
Additional costs - security guards, monitoring parking lots and checking vehicles - are running about $$ @38,000 a month, Flannery said, and about $$ @50,000 has been spent so far on gates and other parking improvements. 
Much of the expense will be billed to airlines and car-rental companies, he said. General airport revenue will cover some of the cost. Congress may provide reimbursement money.
The Des Moines Fire Department is using most of a $$ @300,000 federal grant to buy equipment to respond to chemical or biological attack. On the shopping list is the "Guardian," a $$ @7,000 piece of equipment to detect anthrax and other dangerous organisms, 50 moon suits at about $$ @500 each and body bags, said Jim Mason, coordinator of the fire department's hazardous materials unit. 
Des Moines was the only Iowa city, and one of 120 nationwide, that received the grant for dealing with incidents involving weapons of mass destruction.
"I'm not spending it like I'm going to get it," said Ellen Gordon, head of the Iowa Emergency Management Division and Iowa's homeland security adviser.
Her agency already has spent about $$ @163,000 on anti-terrorism duties since Sept. 11, with the federal government paying 50 percent of personnel costs. 
Equipment purchases include $$ @2,800 for two communications encrypters and $$ @1,800 for a pair of satellite telephones.
