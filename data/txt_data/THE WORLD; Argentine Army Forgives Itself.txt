The military rulers of Argentina last week admitted, sort of, that soldiers and police had been overzealous in the anti-leftist campaign of the 1970's in which hundreds were killed and more than 6,000 people disappeared. The admission was the trimming on a package of pre-election magnaminity mainly consisting of a new law granting security forces amnesty for those crimes.
Argentine politicians and human rights groups were largely outraged. Most major candidates in the Oct. 30 elections that are to mark the country's return to civilian rule said they would seek to repeal the measure, which opponents characterized as illegal and immoral.
Italo Luder, the presidential candidate of the Peronist party, Argentina's largest, said the law would be ''repudiated.'' Francisco Manrique, candidate of the conservative Federal Alliance, said it gave ''unmerited liberty'' to ''protagonists of violence and death.''
In announcing the law, which also gives immunity to people suspected of terrorism, the Government insisted that the armed forces had ''fought for the dignity of man.'' However, it added, in fighting ''terrorist subversion'' the army might have taken actions ''that were incompatible with this aim.''
The leader of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, which represents many relatives of the disappeared, said human rights groups planned to protest with street demonstrations.
