PORTLAND (AP) Carrying signs that said "Stop Government Terrorism," demonstrators gathered outside a federal courthouse to protest a grand jury investigating a string of eco-terrorism arson attacks across the country.
Nearly 50 people gathered in support of Craig Rosebraugh, who was told he must make a sixth appearance before the grand jury in June, when he faces contempt charges if he refuses to answer questions about the Earth Liberation Front.
"It's another round of ridiculous drama that seems to be going nowhere," said Rosebraugh, whose subpoena to appear Wednesday was canceled late Tuesday afternoon.
"It's obvious to me, since they confiscated my belongings, that if they really had evidence they would already have done something," he said.
Rosebraugh has acted as spokesman for the Earth Liberation Front, or ELF, which has claimed responsibility for a Christmas Day arson that caused $ 1 million in damage to a Boise Cascade office in Monmouth, just south of the state capital.
The ELF also has claimed responsibility for an October 1998 arson that caused $ 12 million in damage to a ski area in Vail, Colo., and other fires in Michigan, Indiana and Oregon.
Federal prosecutors previously have called on Rosebraugh, hoping he would lead them to the underground eco-terrorism group, but he has not cooperated with their investigation.
