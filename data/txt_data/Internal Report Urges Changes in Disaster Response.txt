Widespread criticism of the government's sluggish response to Hurricane Katrina was largely deserved, the Homeland Security Department's internal watchdog concludes in a report faulting the agency for focusing on terrorism at the expense of preparing for natural disasters.
  The report, by Inspector General Richard L. Skinner and to be released on Friday, includes 38 recommendations for improving disaster response missions by the department and its Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report's executive summary and the recommendations were obtained Thursday by The Associated Press.
 After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the report said, the department's ''prevention and preparedness for terrorism have overshadowed that for natural hazards, both in perception and in application.'' 
  A homeland security spokesman, Russ Knocke, said many of the recommendations are already being installed at FEMA, including revamping response plans and ensuring that state and local authorities are ready for the next storm season.
  The recommendations call for better training, coordination, and systems for ensuring communications among local and state emergency responders and between federal agencies providing aid. They also call for more clearly defined roles and an established chain of command within the federal government.
