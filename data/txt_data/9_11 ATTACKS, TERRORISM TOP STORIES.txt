Overwhelmingly - and not surprisingly - journalists around the world chose the Sept. 11 terror attacks on the United States and the ensuing war on terrorism as the top news story of 2001, according to a survey by The Associated Press.
The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon immediately had been judged an overwhelming story.
"Apocalypse" was the headline in Britain's Daily Mail of the following day, the major Spanish daily El Pais put out a special edition, and broadcasters covered the tragedy minute by minute.
The attacks also directly touched people worldwide; expatriates and immigrants from at least 26 countries were among the nearly 3,000 World Trade Center victims. In Bangladesh, phones in newspaper offices were jammed the day after as people tried to learn the fate of the 250,000 Bangladeshis working in the New York area.
In the survey of 75 newspaper and broadcast subscribers to the AP in 24 countries, the journalists chose a related story, the anthrax scare, as second among the year's top 10 stories. Third - and separated by just 1 percentage point from No. 2 - was the renewed violence between Palestinians and Israelis.
The top 10 stories:
1. Sept. 11 attacks on the United States and the war on terrorism.
2. Anthrax scare.
3. Middle East violence.
4. George W. Bush takes office as U.S. president.
5. Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosovich arrested, taken to The Hague.
6. World economy weakens.
7. Europe hit by mad cow and foot and mouth diseases.
8. Rising power of the European Union.
9. China admitted to World Trade Organization.
10. A statistical tie: Unrest at G-8 summit and massacre of Nepalese royal family.
