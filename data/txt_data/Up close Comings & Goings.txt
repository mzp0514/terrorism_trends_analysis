FIONA DENTON
NEW JOB TITLE: London-based director of the marine division and head of the war and terrorism team at brokerage Tyser & Co. Ltd.
PREVIOUS POSITION: Executive director of the property division of Lockton Cos. International Ltd.
GOALS FOR NEW POSITION: I plan to expand Tyser’s portfolio of war and terrorism business through dedicated client service and innovation to meet their specific needs.
INDUSTRY OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES: The market is currently at the bottom of a soft cycle with plenty of capacity available and a very low loss ratio. The war and terrorism market has evolved rapidly and there is more competition than there was five years ago, but thanks to its excellent team and solid reputation, Tyser is well-placed to cement its position as a broker of choice in this specialist area.
CAREER HIGHLIGHT: Looking back, it was when I was promoted from trainee broker to senior broker, which signaled the first step on my career ladder.
HOW I GOT HERE: I have always focused on working hard, perseverance, caring about the business, and building a good rapport with clients.
ADVICE: Our insurance market is full of challenges, which change over time. So, my advice is to make sure you can move with them…that’s continued success (in) our market.
GROWING UP: When I was young, I always wanted to be a bus conductor so that I could travel.
HOBBIES: Whenever and wherever I can, I try to fit in scuba diving, skiing, reading, music and travel.
