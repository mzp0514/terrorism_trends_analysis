Merriam-Webster defines a bull market as “a market in which securities or commodities are persistently rising in value. ”
At this writing, we are currently experiencing the second longest bull market in history, which began on March 9, 2009. The longest bull market was from December 4, 1987 to March 24, 2000 lasting 4,494 days.   Despite the sluggish start in the first quarter of 2016 and the recent Brexit vote, the markets have remained in bull territory.
During this time period, there have been several terrorist events in the United States and across the globe.  The following link to a chart shows how the markets have reacted to some of these events:  http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2016/03/22/terror-attacks-and-stocks/82113776/
The S&P 500 took a sharp downturn after the September 11 attacks. You will also recall that the US exchanges were closed for four trading days after the event. After the Boston Marathon bombings, the market declined 2.3% on the day of the attack but 10 days later was very close to a break- even point.   The index traded up after two terrorist shootings in Paris. After the November 13, 2015 Paris attacks on a number of cafes and the Bataclan Theater, the index traded up the first day and the five, 10 and 30 trading days following the tragedy. The S&P 500 did decline after the San Bernardino shootings, but the numbers cannot be used as a comparative base with the market effects during September 11.
This particular downturn was accompanied with other concerns.   Investors were worried about a possible Federal Reserve interest rate hike. Oil was continuing to decline in price and worries of a recession aided in the market decline.
Bill Stone, Chief Investment Strategist at PNC Asset Management Group, is quoted as stating, “Economies and markets tend to adjust and become desensitized to terror attacks over time. The fact remains that the impact of terror attacks on the market has always faded over time”.   (1]
The market’s reaction to terrorist attacks from September 11, 2001 to December 2, 2015 seem to illustrate Mr. Stone’s point.
