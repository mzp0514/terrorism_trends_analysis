IN February 1993, terrorists bombed the parking garage beneath
the World Trade Center in New York City.  The damage was relatively
minor and the twin towers re-opened.
Now the World Trade Center is under attack again, this time by
more efficient predators _ lawyers.
The port authority that owns the building has been hit with 181
lawsuits from tenants and insurers.  They seek $ 1.9 billion in
damages.  That is three times the $ 665 million in property claims
paid in 1993 in the state of New York.
"I'm still trying to figure out how you're negligent if it's an
act of terrorism," said Jeffrey Green, general counsel for the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey.
It is interesting to see who has filed the suits.  Insurance
company officials, who often bad-mouth America's legal system, are
trying to get back the $ 510 million they paid in claims for property
damages and the interruption of business.
"It's called subrogation.  Insurance companies do not pay any
large losses without a fight," said insurance lawyer Eugene Anderson
.  "I call it insurance nullification by litigation."
The other suits are filed by tenants.  Stock brokerage houses
and other businesses seek reimbursement of their insurance
deductibles.
As usual, punitive damages are sought.  Wouldn't be a civil case
nowadays without the plaintiff seeking bushels full of money beyond
the actual damage suffered.
So there's really no need for terrorists from the Middle East
.  U.S. lawyers need no help in undermining America's judicial system
