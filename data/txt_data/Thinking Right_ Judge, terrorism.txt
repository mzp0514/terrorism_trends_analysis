Thinking Right on the week gone by:
 
* 911. In Gordon County, it's when you get time, come. (If a murder's been reported, a gentle knock at the door is probably insufficient. But that's just one guy's opinion.)
 
* Judge Charles Pickering is a monument to the political smear. Had that smear by interest groups on the Democratic left kept him from getting the appointment he deserved on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, it would have been a grave injustice. President Bush appropriately gave him a recess appointment. I didn't recommend it for other judicial nominees awaiting Senate confirmation, but Pickering is 66 --- and this smear should not be allowed to stand as the final chapter in his judicial career.
AJC* Howard Dean's a flash in the pan.
 
* How expectations have grown: A bedridden 21-year-old would be provided nursing home care valued at $56,000 by taxpayers. Not good enough, say advocates, demanding home care that would cost $187,479 per year.
 
* When the war on terrorism is won, a badge of courage should go to Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, target of two recent assassination attempts linked to al-Qaida. He's one of the front-line soldiers taking risks he could have avoided.
 
* Yes! From Bush's State of the Union: "From the beginning, America has sought international support . . . There is a difference, however, between leading a coalition of many nations and submitting to the objections of a few. America will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our people." Write it in stone.
 
* When church members "invest" $3,000, expecting a $500,000 return, it's confirmation of the sucker-born truism. I can't find the victim.
 
* The good thing about the Marcus Dixon case is that there was no victim. Oh, you mean there was one? She and her feelings about whether she consented or was raped while going about her school custodial duties seem to have disappeared.
 
* More reason that organizations' agendas should be fully identified to readers and listeners. What, for example, is Americans Coming Together? Or MoveOn.org? Ah, yes, groups funded by billionaire George Soros dedicated to George W. Bush's defeat. Organizations and foundations that crop up in the news may sound neutral, do-gooder or bipartisan, but they usually have clear --- but rarely fully identified --- special-interest agendas. Campaign finance reform? It just means the rich, like Soros, and the Hollywood famous have more influence in politics.
 
* Georgia legally defines marriage as the union of one man and one woman. That law is one activist federal judge away from being discarded. Amending the state constitution, as Senate Majority Leader Bill Stephens (R-Canton) and others propose, is necessary.
House Democratic leaders, whose political instincts are usually sound, are dead wrong in arguing that the current law is sufficient. Georgia's law is two steps away from being worthless paper: One is Massachusetts recognizing same-sex unions as marriage. The other is a federal judge forcing Georgia to recognize that contract.
 
* Druid Hills Golf Club is a private club with membership rules consistent with Georgia law that properly distinguish between marriage and other relationships. Another reason for a constitutional amendment: to remove all temptation from local governments to use their authority over liquor licenses to force some constituency's social views on private organizations.
 
* Terrific appointment: Alpharetta lawyer Garland Hunt, a solid conservative, named by Gov. Sonny Perdue to the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles. Republicans should aggressively seek out and promote minorities of ability, like Hunt, whose views are compatible with the party's philosophy of free enterprise, limited government and personal responsibility.
