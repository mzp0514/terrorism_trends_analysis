Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi announced a plan Thursday to distribute half of his country's oil wealth in cash grants to his people, but observers said the plan could be merely a propaganda ploy.  Under the plan, each family will be given $7,000 to $10,000 beginning early next year, Gadhafi saidt.
But he broadcast the plan as talk persists in New York that the U.N.  Security Council might expand punitive sanctions against Libya to include an oil embargo.  Such an embargo would cripple a country that derives 95 percent of its income from oil. If Gadhafi were to implement the cash-distribution program in the meantime, he could achieve major propaganda gains by telling his people - when he had to stop it - that the West was cheating them out of their money.  The sanctions are for harboring people suspected of terrorism.  The Libyan leader disclosed his s plan at the final session of the 3,000-member General People's Congress.  JANA, the state-run news agency, said the delegates had interrupted Gadhafi's address with chants of "Long live the leader!" Gadhafi said priority in distributing the cash would be given to Libyans who would emigrate to Egypt, Sudan or Chad, an indication that one aim of the plan was to help people survive the economic woes that have provoked dissent.
