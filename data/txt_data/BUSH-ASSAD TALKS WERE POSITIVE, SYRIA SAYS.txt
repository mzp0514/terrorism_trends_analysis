DAMASCUS, Syria - Syria has described as positive the talks between President Hafez Assad and President George Bush, foes drawn together in the standoff against Iraq.  Syria's official newspapers welcomed the Bush-Assad meeting in Geneva on Friday night, the first between U.S. and Syrian presidents since Assad met Jimmy Carter in 1977.
Officials in Damascus said the two leaders had ''condemned terrorism and stressed the need for defining what distinguishes terrorism from national struggle.'' The United States has accused Syria of sponsoring terrorism, a charge Syria fervently denies.  The White House said the two presidents again had called for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, which it invaded Aug. 2.  Syrian officials said Saturday that the ''atmosphere which prevailed during the Assad-Bush talks was positive.'' Syria is Iraq's chief Arab rival. Along with Egypt and Saudi Arabia, Syria is a key member of the 27-nation alliance in the gulf.  Assad also told Bush on Friday that he would continue seeking the release of Western hostages held in Lebanon, Damascus radio reported Saturday.  The Syrian radio report said Assad had ''declared that Syria would continue to make efforts to help obtain'' the release of the 12 remaining Westerners, including five Americans, held by pro-Iranian Shiite Muslim groups in Lebanon.  Commenting on the talks, al-Thawra, an official daily, warned Iraq that failure to withdraw from Kuwait would lead to ''disastrous consequences.'' ''The chance which is available now for Iraq could not be repeated and Baghdad should seize it and adopt a correct decision and leave Kuwait. .  . .  By doing so Iraq would save itself and the region from a terrible nightmare.''
