WASHINGTON-As expected, the Treasury Department's conclusion that the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act should be not be extended in its present form drew a mixed response on Capitol Hill.
Although the initial enactment of TRIA was a bipartisan effort, and although as recently as last September, the House Financial Services Committee unanimously passed a bill that would have extended TRIA through the end of 2007, reactions to Treasury's report broke on party lines.
In fact, Financial Services Committee Chairman Mike Oxley, R-Ohio, issued a statement praising the report, saying ``a simple extension of the program is not in the best interests of American consumers or the economy.'' After calling for greater private sector involvement and narrowed federal involvement, he added, ``I am confident that we can achieve a comprehensive, fiscally responsible solution to deal with terrorism insurance by the end of this year.''
But Democratic members of the committee made public a letter they sent to Rep. Oxley. They disagreed with Treasury's call for a narrower program and instead called for expanding TRIA's backstop to include group life insurance. In fact, they called on the chairman to ``schedule a hearing and markup on H.R. 1153, which we sponsored, as soon as possible.'' H.R. 1153 would extend an expanded TRIA through the end of 2007.
Enactment of the measure, however, is a long shot at best. It has only one Republican co-sponsor.
