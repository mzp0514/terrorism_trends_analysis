TORONTO â€¢ A Canadian man who spent 10 years at the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay plans to appeal his U.S. terrorism convictions, his attorney said Sunday.
Omar Khadr, 26, has decided to go ahead with the appeal, which will be filed "not too long from now," lawyer Dennis Edney said.
Khadr, the last Western detainee at Guantanamo, was transferred in September to a maximum security facility in Ontario to serve out the remaining six years of his eight-year sentence for war crimes. The Toronto-born son of an alleged al-Qaida financier, Khadr pleaded guilty in 2010 to several charges, including killing a U.S. solider in Afghanistan when he was 15.
Edney said that the defense team would first file an appeal with a U.S. military commission and that if that was unsuccessful, the team would turn to a U.S. civilian court.
A U.S. civilian appeals court recently reversed the verdicts of the only two Guantanamo Bay prisoners convicted in trials by military tribunals.
In both cases, the reasoning was that before enactment of the Military Commissions Act of 2006, which authorized the tribunals for the terrorism suspects at Guantanamo, only violations of the international law of war and pre-existing federal offenses were subject to trial by military commission, a special court for wartime offenses.
The court said the charges of material support for terrorism and conspiracy did not meet that standard.
