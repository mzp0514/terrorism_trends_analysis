Israeli leaders warned Syria on Wednesday that it bears the blame for a double suicide bombing by Hamas militants because it harbors the group's leadership, and they hinted at possible retaliation.
In a first response to Tuesday's attack that killed 16 people in a southern Israeli city, Israeli troops blew up the home of one of the bombers and isolated the West Bank city of Hebron, where the attackers lived.
But Israel was looking farther afield to assign blame.
"The fact that Hamas is operating from Syria will not grant it immunity," said Raanan Gissin, an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.
The overall leader of Hamas, Khaled Mashaal, and his deputies are based in Syria.
The Israeli army chief, Lt. Gen. Moshe Yaalon, said Wednesday that those who support terrorism "cannot sleep quietly at night," mentioning Palestinian leaders, Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas, Syria and Iran.
Sharon added his own implied threat: "Israel's struggle against terrorism will continue unabated. We will apparently need to decide on additional steps to stop terrorism." He did not elaborate.
Last Oct. 5, Israeli planes attacked the training camp of another militant group, Islamic Jihad, outside Damascus, the Syrian capital, a day after a female suicide bomber blew up a restaurant in the Israeli port city of Haifa, killing 21 people.
