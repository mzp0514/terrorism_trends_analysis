Four books on terrorism are on the USA TODAY Best-Selling Books list, which ranks 300 titles. At No. 25: Germs: Biological Weapons and America's Secret War by Judith Miller, Stephen Engelberg and William Broad (Simon & Schuster, $ 27).The rest:
56 Bin Laden: The Man Who Declared War on America by Yossef Bodansky (Forum/Prima, $ 17.95). From the book: "Now in his mid-forties, a university graduate with computer skills, Osama bin Laden lives with his four wives and some fifteen children in a small cave in eastern Afghanistan. Had he followed the path chosen for him by his father, bin Laden could have been a respected building contractor in Saudi Arabia and a billionaire in his own right." The author, who has written eight books on international terrorism and global crises, examines how bin Laden turned into a terrorist leader of radical Islam.
107 Taliban: Militant Islam, Oil & Fundamentalism in Central Asia by Ahmed Rashid (Yale University Press, $ 14.95). Rashid, who has covered Afghanistan for more than two decades, gives an account of the Taliban's rise to power and tells why Afghanistan has become the center of international terrorism. For a really chilling read, the appendix includes a "sample of Taliban decrees relating to women and other cultural issues, after the capture of Kabul, 1996."
266 Living Terrors by Michael Osterholm, John Schwartz (Delta, $ 13.95). Subtitle: What America Needs to Know to Survive the Coming Bioterrorist Catastrophe.
