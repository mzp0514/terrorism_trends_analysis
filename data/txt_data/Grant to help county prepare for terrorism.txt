Federal authorities have granted Hillsborough County $ 250,000 to help prepare  for the fallout from a terrorist attack.
The money is meant to aid local fire rescue departments, which would be  first on the scene of a terrorist assault.
TPA BRFSHillsborough was one of 120  metropolitan areas to receive the grant from the U.S. Bureau of Justice.
Officials are concerned that a terrorist attack could come from violent  domestic groups or foreign factions, said Wade DeHate, special operations  chief for Hillsborough County Fire Rescue. And with 50 percent of Florida's  hazardous material shipped through Tampa's port, officials are concerned about  a dangerous sabotage. The grant will buy protective gear for firefighters,  remedies for exposure and communications equipment to coordinate local and  federal responses, DeHate said. 
 
Planning department director to step down 
 
  TAMPA - Gene Boles, the director of Hillsborough County's planning and  growth management department for seven years, has decided to step down and  work as a special projects planner.
In his new job, Boles will oversee a community planning project in Citrus  Park and Brandon, as well as other projects.
"Your time is taken in management and administration," Boles said of his  current job, "and I would like to do a little planning."
Boles will initially keep his salary of about $ 86,000. His salary will be  evaluated later, Deputy County Administrator Pat Bean said.
Burt Folce, head of the development services division, was named acting  director while officials search for a replacement.
