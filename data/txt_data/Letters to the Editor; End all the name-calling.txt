"Our politics are poisonous enough already" without name-calling, as John Leo said in his opinion piece "Comparing Bush to Hitler goes mainstream" (June 29 TH). The problem is that he focuses only on critics of the present occupant of the White House. Mr. Leo should also decry the Bush campaign's online video that associates Sen. John Kerry with Adolf Hitler, and the Bush administration's preferred tactic of calling their critics unpatriotic, instead of engaging in open debate on the facts and issues.
If our political bloodstream is to be cleansed of poisonous rhetoric, both sides need to stick to "actual arguments." Let's have a serious debate about ways to combat global terrorism that reduce, rather than increase, terrorism and lead to sustainable peace with justice in the world; ways to strengthen ties with our historic allies and build new allies and friends, instead of trashing our allies and deepening hostilities among nations that have not yet become our friends; and ways to avoid rushing to war based on false intelligence. Bush invites this debate when his campaign to keep his White House address claims that we need to keep him on the job of combating global terrorism because he is better at that job than Kerry would be. That's debatable, so let's hear actual arguments, and no name-calling.
