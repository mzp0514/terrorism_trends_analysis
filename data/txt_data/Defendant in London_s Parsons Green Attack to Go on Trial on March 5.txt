LONDON — The trial of Ahmed Hassan Mohammed Ali, an 18-year-old Iraqi orphan charged with attempted murder in connection with a terrorist attack at a London Underground station last month, will begin on March 5, according to British news reports on Friday.
At least 30 people were wounded when the bomb partially detonated on a crowded train on Sept. 15 at the Parsons Green Station in Southwest London. Lee Ingham, the prosecutor, said on Friday that Mr. Ali’s motive for the attack was political and fell under the definition of the Terrorism Act.
Mr. Ali, who appeared via video link for a hearing at the Old Bailey, London’s criminal court, has been charged with “maliciously” causing an explosion “by means of triacetone triperoxide (TATP) or other explosive substances,” according to court documents.
The incident was the fifth terrorism attack in Britain this year. The explosion on the city’s heavily used commuter rail network revived memories of bombings in 2005, which left 52 people dead in the deadliest attack on Britain since World War II.
Mr. Ali, who had been in foster care at the home of a retired couple in Surrey, a county in the Southeast England, was arrested a day after the attack in the departures area of the port in Dover.
