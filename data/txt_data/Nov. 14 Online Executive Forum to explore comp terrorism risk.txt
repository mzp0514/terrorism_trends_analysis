Business Insurance on Nov. 14 at 11 a.m. Eastern Standard Time will host a free Online Executive ForumTM on ``Workers Compensation: Protecting People in the Age of Terrorism.''
The threat of terrorism has not abated since Sept. 11, 2001, and concentrations of workers in office buildings present significant exposures for employers and insurers in the event of another attack. A catastrophic loss could easily result in workers comp losses in the billions of dollars. Attend this Online Executive ForumTM for an in-depth discussion of risk management and insurance issues, ways to minimize the risk to concentrations of workers, and the latest status of the TRIA backstop, among other issues.
Panelists for the Nov. 14 webcast are:
David R. Holmquist, chief operating officer of the Los Angeles Unified School District.
Mark J. Noonan, managing director and workers compensation practice leader at Marsh Inc.
Richard L. Thomas, senior vp and chief underwriting officer, Domestic Brokerage Group, at American International Group Inc.
BI Senior Editor and Western Bureau Chief Roberto Ceniceros will moderate the interactive panel discussion.
The webcast will feature an interactive question and answer period for the live audience. To register for this Online Executive ForumTM as well as view archived prior webcasts, please visit www.BusinessInsurance.com/webinars.
