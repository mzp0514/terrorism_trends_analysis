Without fanfare, senators debating defense spending for next year have proposed eliminating all money for the Pentagon's development of a vast computerized terrorism surveillance program that has raised privacy concerns.
 In the past, Congress has limited the Defense Department's ability to implement the system now known as Terrorism Information Awareness while allowing research to proceed, but the new provision goes further to ban funding outright.
"No funds appropriated or otherwise made available to the Department of Defense â€¦ or to any other department, agency or element of the federal government, may be obligated or expended on research and development on the Terrorism Information Awareness program," the provision says.
 Jan Walker, spokeswoman for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, where the program is being developed and tested under the supervision of retired Adm. John Poindexter, declined to comment on the provision. But the administration sent Congress an analysis of the proposed defense bill that said the provision would "deny an important potential tool in the war on terrorism."
 Poindexter's plan is to develop computer software that can scan vast public and private databases of commercial transactions and personal data globally to provide advance warning of terrorist attacks.
 The research ban was backed by Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, the Senate Appropriations Committee ranking minority member, with tacit approval of committee Chairman Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska.
