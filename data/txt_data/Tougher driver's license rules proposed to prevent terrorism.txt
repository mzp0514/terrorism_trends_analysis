Can Utah driver's licenses be used by terrorists as a form of I.D. to help them get into the country and kill innocent Americans?
Former Utah legislator Matt Throckmorton says it's possible.
And he encouraged a legislative committee Wednesday to tighten up state government's licensing procedure.
"I will bring (Sept. 11 survivors) to the 2004 Legislature" so lawmakers can hear the sad stories for themselves, Throckmorton, who left his Springdale district last year to run for Congress, told the Legislature's Transportation Interim committee.
Five of the 19 Sept. 11 terrorists had Virginia driver's licenses, and Virginia is one of four states along with Utah that make it easy to get driver's licenses, said Throckmorton.
On the other side, Judy Hamaker-Mann, head of the state Driver License Division, says while national security may be one consideration, history shows it is much better to license people who are going to drive anyway, because it forces motorists to register their cars and buy automobile insurance.
Throckmorton also complained that Utah still accepts what's called an ITIN -- an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number -- as I.D. for a driver's license.
The Social Security Administration issues ITINs to someone who doesn't have a birth certificate or regular Social Security number. And Throckmorton says an ITIN can be obtained without being a properly-documented alien, who can get a "non-work" ITIN.
But Hamaker-Mann said the federal government will stop issuing ITINs this year.
