Sinema faced a backlash for not responding more forcefully to the El Paso, Texas shooting, which killed 22 people, other than sending her thoughts to victims of the massacre. “Thinking of all the first responders, victims, and families affected by this senseless act of violence,” Sinema had tweeted out. 
The responses to her tweet can be summed up this way: Why don’t you do something? The Republic’s EJ Montini also criticized Sinema for towing the “Republican line of offering thoughts and prayers (LINK). ” Montini complained that Sinema bills herself as someone whose reason for joining government is to get things done, but, “at first glance, for one of the most important problems of our day, she’s doing exactly what her Republican colleagues in Congress have been doing for decades  nothing,” he wrote. Reaction from Arizona officials to the shootings fell along ideological lines. Gallego went further than most and directly blamed Trump for the shootings, saying America has a president who “rallies the crazies. ” “To be clear for the press @realDonaldTrump + NRA + GOP complicity + white nationalism = domestic terrorism,” he said in another tweet. Gosar, on the other hand, said the blame lies squarely with the shooter. “It is his decision alone. It’s not society’s fault. It’s not the internet’s fault. Peace and love to the families,” he said (LINK). Both McSally and Biggs offered their thoughts and prayers.
