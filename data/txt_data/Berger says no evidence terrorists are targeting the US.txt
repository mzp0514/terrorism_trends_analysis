WASHINGTON -- President Clinton's national security assistant Monday said there is no evidence terrorists are planning attacks against targets in the United States.
Nevertheless, Sandy Berger said, Americans "should be vigilant as they go about their plans for the new year."
Speaking to reporters about the arrest of an Algerian at the Canadian border with Washington state, Berger said there was "a very vigorous investigation going on on what his plans may have been."
But, he said, "we are not aware of any other specific threats against targets in the United States."
White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton had been briefed on counter-terrorism efforts in the pre-New Year's period, including the capture of the Algerian, Ahmed Ressam, near the Canadian border.
"We have ongoing efforts that look at both international terrorism, protecting against domestic terrorism," Lockhart said. "That work is something that the president has closely involved himself in and has done a lot of work on."
Berger said on CBS' "Face the Nation" on Sunday that authorities were still trying to find out whether Ressam, arrested for allegedly bringing explosives into Washington state last week, was part of a terrorist network.
Berger said people should report suspicious packages or activities to the police and take extra care when traveling.
The State Department issued a statement Dec. 11 cautioning U.S. citizens abroad to be alert and to avoid large crowds.
Meanwhile, Customs officials said security was tightened along U.S. borders after Ressam's arrest. Police say he carried bomb material in the trunk of a rented car on a ferry he took to Port Angeles, Wash., from Victoria, British Columbia.
