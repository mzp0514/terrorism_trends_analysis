President Obama is sticking with his view climate change is a global threat on the order of terrorism, in part because groups such as the Islamic State will be defeated in traditional ways.
“But if you start seeing the oceans rise by 5, 6, 7 feet” and if weather patterns change to where “bread baskets to the world suddenly can no longer grow food, then you’re seeing the kind of crisis that we can’t deal with through the deployment of the Marines,” Obama said in an interview on CBS This Morning. 
“We can’t deal with it through pouring money at it,” Obama added. 
As for terrorism, Obama  who is seeking a global climate change agreement  said “we’re gonna get” the Islamic State. 
“They will be defeated,” Obama said. “There will be ongoing efforts to disrupt the world order from terrorists, from rogue states, from cyber attacks. There’s always some bad people out there trying to do bad things. And we have to be vigilant in going after them.” 
Obama’s critics have mocked his efforts to equate climate change and terrorism. Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, called one of the president’s comments “one of the dumbest statements I’ve ever heard in politics.” 
Asked about Trump’s criticism, Obama said: “Mr. Trump should run back a tape or quote on some of the stuff he’s said.” 
Said Obama: Nearly all of the world’s scientists and most of its political parties see climate change as “a really urgent problem.”
