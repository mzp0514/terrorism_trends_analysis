Considering the context of the war on terrorism, its unexpected length, its confounding tactical turns including wholesale introduction of improvised explosive devices, and its limited target - those involved or implicated in the 9/11 terrorist attacks - any presidential escalation of the war into Iran or directly against its military forces without further Congressional authorization constitutes an executive coup against our Republic.
Congress has been complicit by failing to rein in previous military excursions by Presidents Barack Obama and George Bush.
The U.S. was in at the birth of modern Islamic terrorism, activating it against the USSR in Afghanistan 35 years ago. We've sowed the whirlwind.
In any event, Iran is no direct threat to the U.S. It's a large, historically dynamic county whose natural position is as a regional power. We can't cork it up any longer without precipitating a disastrous explosion.
Guess who'd have to pick up the pieces!
