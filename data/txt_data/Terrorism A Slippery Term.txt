TO THE EDITORS:
Should we care that the federal government is storing all our digital communications for future reference? We're not terrorists.
Problem is, "terrorism" has become a slippery term. In May, a federal court jailed a peaceful, Bible-quoting nun for trespassing at a nuclear weapons production facility because, the judge said, she had committed a terrorist act.
Some of us worship in congregations that proclaim the same Jesus that got that nun into trouble.
Some of us work to save the planet from certain collapse if we don't leave most existing fossil fuel reserves in the ground.
Some of us stand in public opposition to our government's highest goal: global domination of land, sea, air, space and communications.
Some of us support the boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign against companies doing business in areas illegally occupied by the State of Israel.
Some of us stand committed to holding government accountable to the Constitution and the rights to peacefully assemble, bear arms and carry on a private life
If a nun who peacefully challenges the morality of building more nuclear weapons is a terrorist, then many of us are at risk. Now is the time to make our voices heard.
