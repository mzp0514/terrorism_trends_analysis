MOAMMAR Gadhafi recently celebrated the 25th anniversary of his
assumption of control of the Libyan government.  His quarter-century
of rule has been marked by terrorism, political repression, and a
wacky home brew of socialist and Islamic tenets.
The world can thank President Reagan for silencing this nut case
in 1986 with a strategic bombing of Tripoli in retaliation for the
bombing of a Berlin discotheque.
In 1988, the United Nations finally cut off economic trade with
Gadhafi and Libya following the bombing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie,
Scotland.
How sad that it took the world 19 years to finally stand up to
Gadhafi, who along with Fidel Castro, Saddam Hussein and the Kim
family of North Korea continue to threaten civilization with
terrorism.
At his anniversary fete, Gadhafi accused the United States of
being "crazed with power."
Who? Us?
And he called President Clinton a friend.
The president should be insulted.
There's only one way of dealing with the Gadhafis of the world
.  Presidents Reagan and Bush knew how.
When the United States isolates menaces like Gadhafi, the world
becomes safer.  When terrorists like Carlos the Jackal run out of
places to hide, isn't it odd how groups such as the Palestine
Liberation Organization and the Irish Republican Army suddenly want
to talk peace?
The U.N. embargo against Libya must continue as long as Gadhafi
is in power.  It's unfortunate that 4.5 million Libyans must suffer
in the meantime.-30-
