TO THE EDITOR: I read the article on the volunteer citizens group that recently started to patrol the California-Mexico border. Ordinary citizens would patrol the border and contact the Border Patrol if they noticed any suspicious activity.
#725599.wrk#The article also mentioned that they were armed, but group members stressed the guns were for their own protection only. There was a protest against this organization, and the protestors said, Racists, go home! That anyone would protest a citizens group trying to protect our borders from illegal immigration and terrorists is absolutely ludicrous. The protesting is analogous to someone protesting a volunteer fire company. I am surprised that more organizations like this are not being formed. The Border Patrol is understaffed and, as another recent article about illegal immigration pointed out, the number of illegal immigrants has grown exponentially since 2000. I wonder why the protesters assumed these concerned citizens are racists. Is it racist to aid the enforcement of the law? Is it racist to fight terrorism? Or is it just racist to try to prevent Mexicans and other Central and South Americans from coming into the United States illegally? Perhaps I am simply a racist myself. After all, I believe in the enforcement of the law; I believe terrorism must be stopped; I believe people should have to immigrate legally; and I believe in being proactive when I have a concern.
