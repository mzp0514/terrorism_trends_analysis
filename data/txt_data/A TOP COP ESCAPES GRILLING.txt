A federal judge rejected yesterday a bid by civil liberties advocates to grill the NYPD's top terrorism expert in a dispute over the right of police to investigate political groups.
But Judge Charles Haight left open the possibility that Deputy Commissioner David Cohen, a former deputy director of the CIA, might yet be hauled into Manhattan Federal Court.
Haight questioned whether the Police Department was going too far with its proposal to ease the 1985 Handshu Agreement, which restricts police monitoring of political activities.
He called it "the functional equivalent of altering a full-dress formal evening suit resplendent with white tie and tails into a pair of gym shorts."
In a 15-page decision, the judge said he may yet have Cohen testify about terrorism threats that he argues make the changes necessary.
Haight said he might want Cohen to explain why new FBI guidelines for terrorism probes run 25 pages while the proposed modified Handschu guidelines fit on two pages.
Cohen said in court papers that requiring the NYPD to adhere to the agreement and get the approval of a three-person panel to investigate political groups is unworkable in the context of terrorism.
Plaintiff attorney Jethro Eisenstein argues that relaxing the agreement would lead to racial profiling and jeopardize civil rights.
