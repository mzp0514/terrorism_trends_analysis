Pasco deputies deal every day with people who abuse pain pills and drive drunk, people who steal and throw fists and break windows.
But Sheriff Bob White plans to spend as much as $45,000 to make sure his officers can deal with suspects who haven't made many arrest reports here:
Radical Islamic terrorists.
Since January, White's office has paid terrorism experts about $22,500 for five classes for his officers. He plans to put on as many as five more $4,500 classes focused on Islamic terrorism.
Another $1,000 class for volunteer safety officers and honorary deputies is also scheduled.
That course includes lessons on how radical Muslims groom their facial hair and wear their pants, as well as a "behavioral analysis technique to distinguish visually between moderates and radicals."
Though the money makes up a minuscule portion of his $85.5 million budget, such spending could raise some eyebrows given White's recent decision to take his fight for another $4 million in funding to the governor and Cabinet.
Spokesman Kevin Doll said the sheriff believes the money is well spent.
"Sheriff White believes it's appropriate training for our current world," Doll said.
The money for the deputies' courses comes out of the training budget, which is made up of state funds, not county property tax revenue, Doll said. Last year's total training budget was around $361,000.
The civilian course will be financed out of a separate fund, which also consists of state money, he said.
The courses at Pasco Hernando Community College will be led by Sam Kharoba, who runs a Coral Springs business called Counter Terrorism Operations Center.
Kharoba compared his course to the training law enforcement officers receive in dealing with gangs or drugs.
Officers in those cases learn about gang markings, for instance, or how to differentiate among drugs.
"The training I do makes an officer effective in identifying signs associated with jihad," Kharoba said.
Doll noted that the 911 terrorists trained in Florida. "Unfortunately, terrorism is a fact of life, and we want to be prepared for any attempts that might occur in Pasco," he said. "Pasco is not a target-rich environment ... but that doesn't mean home-grown terrorists might not try something in the county."
