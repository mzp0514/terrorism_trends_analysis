The United States and its allies should not pursue "hidden agendas" in their widening war on terror because the campaign is not the world's overriding concern, the head of the Arab League said Friday.
Rather, the Arab world's major worry is "the Israeli military occupation of Arab territories and the infringement of the rights of Palestinians," said Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa.
Moussa warned Washington and its allies against using their worldwide hunt for terrorists for "settling accounts and imposing a different world order" - an apparent reference to Arab fears of a planned U.S. attack on Iraq.
Even though Middle East countries also consider terrorism "evil," joining the Western campaign against it was not the region's top priority, Moussa said.
Moussa spoke at an international conference planning anti-terror strategies that was convened by the Austrian Defense Ministry. His comments appeared to indirectly criticize Western participants, who depicted the need for worldwide mobilization of resources against terrorism as the main concern of the international community.
He also argued that terrorism is not linked to any one region, race or religion.
"We see an attempt to link Islam to terrorism," Moussa said.
