Chicago may have good reasons for restricting unlicensed peddlers outside of sports arenas, but let's not drag terrorism into the discussion.
The ordinance in dispute was enacted in 1995, back in the days when domestic terrorism was a remote fear.
It was based on dealing with congestion problems -- or so Chicago officials claim.
Others see it as a way to control who makes money, not just to control congestion.
Calling the ordinance a restraint on free speech seems almost as far-fetched as saying it's a tool to fight terrorism. However, the target wasn't selling peanuts. Mark G. Weinberg was selling books critical of Chicago Blackhawks owner Bill Wirtz outside the United Center, where the hockey team plays.
His free speech claim prevailed in the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which struck down the ordinance.
Now representatives of Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, the National Basketball Association and the National Football League-rallying behind the city to get the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the ruling -- based on the argument that terrorists masquerading as vendors could strike outside a stadium.
It's difficult to see how terrorist "peddlers" outside a sporting venue would be any greater security threat than terrorists disguised as fans.
Even if it's feared the vendors could more readily conceal weapons or explosives amid their wares, it's hard to see how the challenged ordinance would prevent that.
Pressing the terrorist threat argument could backfire on the sports leagues if it causes fear among fans who find it safer to just stay home.
