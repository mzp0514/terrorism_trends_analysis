Today, almost all warfare centers on terrorist activities. And upon terrorist nations that add their support. Such as Iran and North Korea. From whence do these terrorists originate? Basically, from the radicalists of the Islam religion. Whom leaders know the names of said terrorists. Likely their wives and children as well.
Specifically, scripture points out that these terrorists are descended from the tribe of Amalek. Amalek that attacked Israel's stragglers, as they were nearing Mount Horeb. Scripture also tells us that said Amalekite terrorists would be enemies from "generation to generation,"  from then until today.
Consider the terrorist leader Osama bin Laden. He was from Medina in Arabia. Medina being the capital city of Amalek. Mohamed's tomb is in Medina. His youngest wife was of Amalek. Osama's second in command was/is a "doctor" of Egypt. An Amalekite via a prince of Amalek that fled to Egypt during the reign of Solomon. He married a daughter of the king of Egypt. The founder of today's "terrorists" in Egypt. What of the Taliban? Yes, Amalekites. Look up Haman the Agagaite in the book of Esther. Agag was a king of Amalek in King Saul's day.
But today, many of the countries in the United Nations are tired of said Amalekites. Especially those of Christian Europe. In present secret, they are beginning to unite to put an end to terrorism. The pope is working with them to try to get the various "church/religions" to work with the state/military to unitedly go to war against Amalek. The U.N. has a mandate to put an end to terrorism. Hopefully by the year 2030. And scripture shows that they will indeed do so.
