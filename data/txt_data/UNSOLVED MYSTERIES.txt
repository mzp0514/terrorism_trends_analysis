Do law enforcement agencies fail to pursue justice when foreign-born journalists are murdered in the the United States? The Committee to Protect Journalists raised that question in a recent report that told how employees of foreign-language media were murdered and their cases investigated half-heartedly.
Twelve journalists were murdered in the United States during the 1980s; 10 were immigrants.
Eight of the cases remain unsolved. "If 10 white American reporters had been killed in cold blood on U.S. soil, the shock waves would have galvanized the media and law enforcement officials," said Ana Arana, principal researcher of the report. She charged that in many cases the homicides were "deliberate, coldly coordinated acts of terrorism" that failed to attract the attention of mainstream reporters because the issues weren't deemed important.
Law enforcement officials often do not coordinate the efforts well in such cases, the report said. A greater problem is the lack of understanding of the immigrant community, where language and customs may be unfamiliar.
Attorney General Janet Reno has vowed renewed investigations. In this nation of immigrants, the so-called immigrant press should not be dismissed.
