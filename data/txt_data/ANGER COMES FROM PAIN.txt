I am writing in response to Marshall A. Hershberg's Aug. 4 letter, ''It's Up to Chairman Arafat.''
I wonder if Mr. Hershberg has ever considered what makes a young Palestinian give up his own life in order to kill Israelis, who, he feels, have occupied his land for the last 30 years.
Could this terrible act be the result of despairing of ever being free from the yoke of a brutal Israeli occupation?
Mr. Hershberg seems to think that it is only the Palestinians who are guilty of terrorism. Evidently he did not read Ari Shavit's (a columnist for Ha'aretz, a Hebrew language newspaper) article, ''How Easily We Killed Them'' in The New York Times.
I quote from his article: ''We killed 170 people in Lebanon last month. Most of them were refugees. A good number were women, children and the elderly. We killed them under the umbrella of a peace campaign. We killed them out of a certain naive hubris. Believing with absolute certitude that now, with the White House, the Senate and much of the American media in our hands, the lives of others do not count as much as our own.''
Mr. Shavit said the Israeli government believes that it has the right to instruct 400,000 people to leave their homes within eight hours and when those eight hours have passed, to treat their homes as military targets.
I guess Mr. Hershberg does not object to terrorism as long as it is high-tech terrorism directed towards non-Jews; it is the low-tech terrorism directed against Jews that he finds barbaric.
