Mail opposing more United States arms for El Salvador was piled high on his desk last week when Representative Silvio O. Conte, Republican of Massachusetts, voted for $5 million more in military aid. The request, for this fiscal year, passed a House appropriations subcommittee by an 8-to-7 vote; under Congressional rules, no higher approval is required.
US military aid to El Salvador grows as does public opinion against such aid
Explaining why he had gone against the wishes of his constituents, Mr. Conte said he felt obliged to support the President because, ''This is the first foreign policy issue that the Administration has had out of the box.''
Many Americans wish Washington would slam the lid, however. On college campuses and in cities throughout the country, demonstrators last week protested President Reagan's decision to send 54 military advisers and $25 million in arms to a regime whose war against leftist guerrillas has been blemished by its own terrorism. A Gallup poll found that two out of three Americans who knew about the war feared it would become ''another Vietnam.'' White House mail was running 10-to-1 against Administration policy.
Mr. Conte, the ranking Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, said he would not approve further military aid until the Salvadoran Government caught and punished the murderers of four American missionaries and ''no longer permitted its security forces to kill innocent civilians.''
The junta's guerrilla opponents protested in their own way, bombarding the United States Embassy with submachine guns and rocketpropelled grenades. The fourth such attack in three weeks, it caused extensive damage but no casualties.
