The latest report to Congress on released Guantanamo Bay inmates shows more returning to terrorism, confirming yet again that the Obama administration's desire to close the prison and release its inmates is no way to fight terrorism. 
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence report confirms that among 603 released Gitmo detainees, 100 - up from 97 as of January - returned to terrorism, including 56 now at large. Another 74 ex-inmates, including 47 now free, are suspected of returning to terrorism. 
Released with no guarantees regarding their whereabouts, contacts or activities, former Gitmo inmates have made America and the world less safe. The Washington Free Beacon reports that ex-inmates formed Yemen-based al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula - which has tried to bomb U.S. airliners and prompted last month's closure of 19 U.S. embassies - and one leads al-Qaida affiliate Ansar al-Sharia, which trains jihadists in Libya to join al-Qaida-backed forces in Syria. 
Thus, it's astounding that in May, President Obama lifted a ban on sending inmates to Yemen in favor of case-by-case reviews - and renewed his call to close Gitmo, a step that would further fuel Syria's conflagration. 
Unlike Mr. Obama, the House Armed Services Committee holds no illusions about the ongoing terror war. It has language in the fiscal-year 2014 defense bill prohibiting Gitmo's closure and inmate transfers to Yemen - commonsense safeguards against this administration's self-defeating tendency toward coddling terrorists.
