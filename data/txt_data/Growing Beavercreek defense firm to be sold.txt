A growing Beavercreek-based defense contractor will be acquired by larger firm near Washington, D.C.
Alion Science and Technology Corp., headquartered in McLean, Va., announced has a pending agreement to buy MacAulay-Brown.
 "MacB's offerings are truly differentiated in the government contractor market, and through this acquisition we strengthen our inroads into emerging technologies in electronic warfare, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and cloud solutions," stated Steve Schorer, president and CEO of Alion.
 MacAulay-Brown is one of the largest locally-based defense contractors, leading classified projects in fields like engineering and technical services, cybersecruity and counter-terrorism analysis.
 Ailion is part of the portfolio of private equity company Vertias Capital.
 Sid Fuchs, president and CEO of MacB, as the firm is often called, said in a statement that he was looking forward to working with Alion and Veritas Capital "to take this enterprise to the next level."
 "This acquisition creates a uniquely competitive and innovative company focused on NextGen engineering and product solutions for national security missions," Fuchs said.
 While MacB's corporate capital has been in Beavercreek, it has also operated a national capital headquarters in Vienna, Va. and has about 450 local employees and 1,500 employees nationally.
