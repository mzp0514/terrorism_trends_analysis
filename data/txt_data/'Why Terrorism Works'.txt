To the Editor:
Barry Gewen, in his review of "Why Terrorism Works" (Sept. 15), seems to approve of the way I seek to strike a balance between liberty and security, but he misstates my positions on racial profiling and deportation. I favor a limited telemetric national ID card precisely because "it would eliminate much of the justification now offered for racial or ethnic profiling." 
I believe it is "far better for everybody to be deprived of a little bit of anonymity than for one specific ethnic group to bear a disproportionate part of the burden." I am against any system under which "all members of a particular race become suspect," but I favor the use of race or ethnicity "where the crime has a racial or religious component" or where the assailant has been specifically identified by reference to such characteristics. This is not racial profiling. 
I do disagree with the current "twilight zone," under which "millions of people are de facto accepted as residents while de jure being illegally here," and argue that the status of those we want to have remain be regularized through an amnesty so that we can keep track of those aliens who are truly here illegally.
     Finally, I resent Gewen's characterization of "Why Terrorism Works" as "an instant book." I have been writing and teaching about terrorism for more than 30 years and devoted seven months to writing this well-documented (30 pages of footnotes) book published by a well-respected academic press (Yale University).
