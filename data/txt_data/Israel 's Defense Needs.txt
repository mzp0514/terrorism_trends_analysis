To the Editor: 
  Re ''Israel Directs High-Tech Prowess at Covid-19, With Numerous Promising Leads'' (news article, May 8):
  It's really unfortunate that your otherwise legitimate and important story about how Israel's military is developing innovative responses to the Covid-19 pandemic starts out with language accusing the Defense Ministry of being ''best known for pioneering cutting-edge ways to kill people and blow things up.''
  Wow. That's sensationalist, degrading and demonizing language. Would The Times use the same verbiage to describe the U.S. Department of Defense?
  The Israeli Defense Ministry's research and defense arm is in fact critical to Israel's defense and security. In the face of murderous regimes like the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah, and a reign of terrorism from Palestinian suicide bombers, tunnels and homemade rockets targeting civilians, Israel's military has unfortunately had no choice but to innovate again and again over the years to protect its people from harm.
  This gratuitous opener not only diverts attention from this unique story, but also seems to call into question Israel's legitimate defense needs. The Times can do better.
