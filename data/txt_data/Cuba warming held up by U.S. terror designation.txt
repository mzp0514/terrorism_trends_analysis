American hopes of opening an embassy in Havana during a regional summit have been snarled in disputes about Cuba's presence on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terror and U.S. diplomats' freedom to travel and talk to ordinary Cubans without restriction, officials say.
The Summit of the Americas was the scene of the presidents' first face-to-face meeting since they announced Dec. 17 that they will re-establish diplomatic relations after a half-century of hostility.
Negotiators on both sides said they are confident they will be able to strike a deal to reopen embassies in the coming weeks after the summit.
Asked about the latest on the embassies, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters that "when you have a country that has essentially been ostracized by the United States for five decades ... it's going to take a little bit of time to re-establish some trust."
The U.S. and Cuba have held three rounds of talks about restoring diplomatic relations. Cuba's main demand is to be removed from the terror list, a Cold War-era designation that isolates it from much of the world financial system because banks fear repercussions from doing business with designated countries.
Washington has long since stopped accusing Havana of supporting terrorism and Obama made clear in December that he intends to remove Cuba from the list. But U.S. officials said the president must first send Congress a report that says Cuba has not provided any support for international terrorism during the previous six months and has assured the United States that it will not support terrorism in the future.
