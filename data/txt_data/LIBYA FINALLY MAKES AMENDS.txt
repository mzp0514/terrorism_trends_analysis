Body


The book seems to have been closed on one of the nastier episodes of international terrorism.
Libya has paid $1.5 billion to compensate the families of victims of two Libyan-backed terrorist attacks in the 1980s -- the 1988 bombing of Pam Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 280, including 180 Americans, and the 1986 bombing of a Berlin disco popular with American soldiers that killed three, including two Americans, and wounded 230.
In retaliation for the Berlin bombing, then-President Reagan ordered air strikes on Tripoli and Benghazi that killed 41 Libyans including leader Moammar Gadhafi's adopted daughter. Those families will be compensated with an additional $300 million, the source of which is not clear but the Bush administration has said none of it will come from U.S. taxpayers.
Last Friday, President Bush signed an order restoring Libya's sovereign immunity from terror-related lawsuits. Some in Congress have balked at naming a new U.S. ambassador to Libya and releasing the funds to build a new embassy, but these next logical steps should be taken quickly. Libya has enormous oil and gas reserves and U.S. energy firms deserve their shot at that business. Libya needs the investment and, frankly, we need the oil.
The compensation deal completes a remarkable transformation that saw Libya, which seemingly never met a terrorist movement it wouldn't fund, renounce terrorism with apparent sincerity and, astonishingly, agree to the dismantling of its long-range missile program, its development of chemical and biological weapons and a nuclear weapons program that was much further along than Western intelligence anticipated.
