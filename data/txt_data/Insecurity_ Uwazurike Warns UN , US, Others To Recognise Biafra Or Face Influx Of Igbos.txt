Ralph Uwazuruike BEVERLY HILLS, August 09, (THEWILL)  Founder of the Movement for the Actualization of Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), Chief Ralph Uwazuruike, has called on the United Nations, United States and other countries to recognize Biafra as a sovereign Nation or be ready to face the dire consequences as he warned that people from the south east region will be left with no option in the face of the current security threats than to find their way into Europe and other Continents. Uwazuruike said his position is further reinforced by a report in which the Commander of US Special Operations in Africa, Major General David Anderson, who was quoted as saying in a digital briefing on US efforts to combat terrorism in Africa that Boko Haram, ISIS, Al Qaeda, ISWA and others, had penetrated the North East and other regions and were advancing to Southern Nigeria.
 "The world could not afford to witness another major war in Nigeria caused by the inaction of the Federal Government," Uwazurike warned. There have been media reports citing the United States of a possible ISIS, Al Qaeda infiltration into southern Nigeria and to further expand to other parts of West Africa, though the Nigeria military has dismissed the report, saying that "such security alarm from US is not new.
