The NYPD is monitoring locations associated with the billionaire philanthropist and liberal donor George Soros after a bomb was found in the mailbox of his Westchester County home, Commissioner James O'Neill said.
The city's top cop did not reveal which Soros sites were under NYPD surveillance, but two political organizations he is closely associated with - New America and Open Society Foundations - have offices in the city.
"What we've done, out of an abundance of caution is, we're in contact with the Soros organization and we are deploying CRC to locations that are within New York City. Any locations that are connected with the Soros organization," O'Neill said.
CRC refers to the NYPD's Critical Response Command.
O'Neill declined to say if there was a note with the explosive a Soros employee found in the mailbox at the home in the Katonah section of Bedford.
Authorities were able to detonate the device without anyone being injured.
The case is being investigated by the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force, which includes NYPD detectives.
Soros, 88, has long been the subject of right-wing conspiracy theories. A Republican congressman in Florida, Matt Gaetz, recently speculated without evidence that a caravan of migrants traveling north through Mexico to the United States was funded by Soros.
Soros's Open Society Foundations denied involvement. President Trump, apparently picking up on the conspiracy theory, has said Democrats support the caravan and that "a lot of money" has been given to the migrants.
