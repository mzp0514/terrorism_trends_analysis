LOS ANGELES - The nuclear terrorism thriller "The Sum of All Fears" continued to add up with moviegoers, taking in $ 18.7 million to remain the No. 1 film for a second weekend.
"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood" opened in second place with $ 16.35 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.
"Bad Company," another film about a stray nuclear device, proved a bit of a bomb. It debuted in fourth place with just $ 10.5 million.
Rounding out the top five were the year's biggest hits. "Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," was No. 3 with $ 13.9 million, lifting its total to $ 255 million after 25 days.
"Spider-Man" came in fifth with $ 10 million for a 38-day total of $ 370.1 million.
The industry rebounded after last weekend, when the overall box office slumped for the first time in nearly four months. The top 12 movies this weekend grossed $ 101.7 million, up about 8 percent from the same weekend last year.
Still, it was a relatively quiet weekend compared to most of May, when "Spider-Man" and "Attack of the Clones" drove up revenues by 50 percent or more each weekend.
"You get used to expecting record-breaking films every weekend, especially this summer. I think we're just in a lull," said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box office tracker Exhibitor Relations. "It's a little slow now, then some big movie will come along and set the world on fire again."
Next weekend brings three major releases: the live-action adaptation of "Scooby-Doo," Matt Damon's spy adventure "The Bourne Identity" and Nicolas Cage's war drama "Windtalkers."
