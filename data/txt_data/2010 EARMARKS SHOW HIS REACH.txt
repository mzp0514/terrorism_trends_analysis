U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young never shied from the political largesse he secured for Pinellas County and Florida - and over the years he used his clout to bring back hundreds of millions.
"We get calls on a regular basis from people saying 'I'm against earmarks,'" he told the Tampa Bay Times in a 2010 interview. "Well, I say, 'Are you opposed to fixing U.S. 19, to make it a safe highway?' 'Oh, no, no.' 'Well, that was an earmark.' I say, 'Are you opposed to building that new hospital for veterans?' 'No, absolutely not.' 'Well, that was an earmark.' The trouble is the media has reported earmarks as something evil without actually reporting exactly what earmarks can do. I would agree that probably some of the congressional earmarks should have never been approved and there probably should have been a better system."
It's almost impossible to know exactly how much Young secured because disclosure was not required until 2007. But 2010, the final year before earmarks were banned, provides a vivid illustration of Young's reach.
(Note: This is a list of the "solo" earmarks and excludes a not-insignificant amount Young secured with other lawmakers. Also, the odd descriptions are often defense industry related projects.)
