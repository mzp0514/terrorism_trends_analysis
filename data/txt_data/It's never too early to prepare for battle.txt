IT NEVER HURTS to prepare your argument early.
That's exactly what supporters of the federal terrorism insurance backstop did in their comments regarding the availability and affordability of terrorism coverage to the President's Working Group on Financial Markets. The argument offered by backstop supporters is simple and compelling: Without the backstop, an adequate amount of affordable terrorism insurance simply wouldn't exist.
The working group is required to report on the long-term availability and affordability of terrorism coverage to Congress this year. The group also is required to report to Congress on the state of the market in 2013, about a year before the program must be reauthorized or expire.
Supporters of the backstop-risk managers, insurers, reinsurers, brokers and others including Business Insurance-need to start thinking about the argument they will make for extension of the program four years from now. The comments submitted to the working group this year could provide the framework for that argument.
Four years may seem like a long time, but remember that passing the legislation that created the program in 2002 as well as the measures that extended the program in 2005 and 2007 were not easy tasks. There's no reason to believe that getting Congress to agree to an extension in 2014 will be any easier.
In their comments to the working group, backstop supporters have made a compelling case that it is indispensable. It's not too early to begin considering how that case can be made even stronger in anticipation of a battle over extending it four years from now.
