The school board has tapped a retired Coast Guard commander as the manager of school safety and security.
Michael D. Evanish was hired by the board on Sept. 26 at an annual salary of $79,000.
Mr. Evanish spent more than 20 years in the Coast Guard, including serving as deputy incident commander for New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina, and commander/senior reserve officer for an anti-terrorism team.
After retiring from the Coast Guard, he served as branch manager for U.S. Security Associates in Wheeling, W.Va., from 2013-17 and operations manager for PalAmerican Security in Robinson.
"This is a higher profile but very important position. I take it as seriously as it can be taken," he said. "I look at it as an opportunity to continue my public service, but in a very personal way. I'm very excited to get going."
He will oversee the district's comprehensive safety plan to address emergency preparedness, safety and security, and will work with district administrators, building principals, building-level crisis teams and the school resource officers at the high schools.
The board also moved forward with plans to install artificial turf on the intermediate high school fields. It hired Common Ground for up to $39,500 to prepare specifications for installation of the turf, and Tower Engineering for up to $14,789 to prepare the specifications for the installation of power for lights at the fields.
