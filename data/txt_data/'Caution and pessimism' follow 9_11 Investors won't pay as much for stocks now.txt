Five years is a long time on Wall Street, except when it comes to erasing the psychological damage from the Sept. 11 attacks.
Stocks are up since then, though not by much: The Dow Jones industrial average is up 18.6% and the Standard & Poor's 500 18.9% from just before the attacks, a 3.5% annual return that's way below long-term averages.
It's impossible to know how much the terrorist attacks are to blame for the market's malaise. After all, an earnings recession started in late 2000, and the USA has just emerged from one of its worst periods of corporate fraud in at least a generation. But the attacks injected a new permanent variable into stocks: fear.
"There's a chronic sense of caution and pessimism" that didn't exist before the attacks, says Jim Paulsen of Wells Capital Management. That is showing up in:
*Depressed valuations. Heightened trepidation partly explains why investors won't pay as much for stocks, says Bob Doll, chief investment officer of Merrill Lynch Investment Managers.
Since Sept. 11, 2001, U.S. corporate profits have jumped nearly 75%. Yet that has minimal effect on stock prices, which have pushed the price-earnings ratio down. On Sept. 10, 2001, the S&P 500 traded for 23.2 times its earnings over the previous 12 months. That's sunk to 15.9. That quantifies reduced investor confidence. "The threat of terrorism is in people's minds, so it's in their investment lives," Doll says.
*Ripple effects. Since the attacks hit during a recession, it forced the Federal Reserve to slash short-term interest rates more than expected, says Liz Ann Sonders of Charles Schwab. Short-term rates hit an almost unheard of low of 1% in 2003, which helped inflate a housing bubble, she says. Now that bubble's deflation is haunting stocks as investors worry how consumers will be affected, she says.
*Faster reactions.  Investors have learned to react more rapidly and less severely to terrorism, Doll says. When trading resumed after the Sept. 11 attacks, the S&P 500 initially tumbled 11.6% before bottoming. But investors collected themselves: The S&P was up 20.3% six months afterward. The Bali bombings in 2002 had a similar shock: The Jakarta composite index fell 10.4% at first and six months later was up 29.9%. Responses have been more muted since. The IBEX 35, FTSE 100 and BSE Sensex 30 indexes fell just 7.2%, 1.4% and 6.3%, respectively, after the 2004 Madrid, 2005 London and 2006 India bombings.
Investors realized many doomsday scenarios didn't materialize. "We now know that many of the fears ...that emerged in the wake of 9/11 proved to be unfounded," Joseph Quinlan of Bank of America wrote in a report. But Sonders hopes investors aren't forgetting the risk. "With additional time without an attack, (investors) may be lulled into the sense (terrorism) may not affect them."
