ALBANY - Jewish leaders joined Gov. Cuomo on Thursday to denounce recent anti-Semitic attacks and push his plan to create a state law that would treat hate crimes as domestic terrorism.
Cuomo launched a new campaign, dubbed #NoHateInOurState, at the Manhattan event and called on the Legislature to get on board with his budget plan to create a domestic terrorism law, allocate $25 million for religious not-for-profit organizations vulnerable to hate crimes, create an education curriculum on diversity and tolerance for students and invest $2 million to support the State Police Hate Crimes Task Force.
"As New Yorkers, as Governor of New York, I want to make it clear that there is no tolerance for this activity on any level," Cuomo said. "It's not just immoral, it's not just wrong it's also illegal. And we're going to pass additional legislation to make that position clear. We will enforce the law to the fullest extent."
The state has seen 42 acts of anti-Semitism already this year, the governor noted.
This past weekend, several Jewish community centers around the country, including one in the state capital, received anonymous bomb threats via email. Cuomo visited the Albany Jewish Community Center on Sunday after it had been evacuated and searched.
Cuomo's New York Hate Crime Anti-Terrorism Act would include hate crimes as domestic terrorism The measure would include mass violence motivated by hate and create penalties of up to life in prison for offenders.
