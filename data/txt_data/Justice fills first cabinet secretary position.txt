Gov.-elect Jim Justice announced his first cabinet secretary appointment Wednesday, naming former Wood County sheriff and retired U.S. Treasury Department special agent Jeff Sandy as secretary of Military Affairs and Public Safety.
"Jeff served our country and the people of Wood County with distinction, and I am totally confident that he will continue his extraordinary service to the people of West Virginia, Justice said in a prepared statement. "Jeff Sandy is prepared to keep West Virginians safe and make sure our state is ready to handle emergencies.
Sandy also has considerable counter-terrorism experience, and is a member of the U.S. Department of Justice-funded State and Local Anti-Terrorism Training (SLATT) team.
"When the Governor-elect called me, and asked me to be his Secretary for DMAPS, it was an honor and an opportunity to give back to the state that I love, Sandy said in a written release. "I assure the people of West Virginia that I will do everything in my power to keep West Virginians safe from foreign and domestic threats to our way of life.
Military Affairs and Public Safety oversees a number of state agencies including the Division of Corrections, Regional Jail Authority, Juvenile Services, Homeland Security, State Police, and the state Fire Marshal, among others. Joe Thornton is the current MAPS secretary.
