What began as a simple fistfight in a bathroom at the Olympic stadium quickly escalated into a stabbing, a bombing and a hostage-taking incident.
By nightfall, the FBI had been called in and its SWAT teams were trying to evacuate the wounded and determine how many hostages were being held and who was holding them.
That was the scenario played out Tuesday by more than 200 local and federal law enforcement personnel in "Olympic Exercise Bravo," a major exercise to test the anti-terrorist capabilities of agencies involved in Olympic security next summer.
The exercise will continue until about 1 p.m. today and is being closely monitored not only by ACOG security officials but also by top Justice Department officials in Washington, including Attorney General Janet Reno.
"The focus of this is the coordination among the agencies, since we are bringing some elements we don't normally have in Atlanta," said Dave Maples, supervisory special agent for the FBI's Atlanta office.
Among the agencies brought in for the exercise were FBI SWAT members and military explosives experts. They worked with Atlanta police officials, MARTA police, the Atlanta Fire Department and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
"We try to make these as authentic as possible so the players can get a real feel for what they may have to face," said David Johnson, special agent in charge of the FBI's Atlanta office and former head of the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team.
