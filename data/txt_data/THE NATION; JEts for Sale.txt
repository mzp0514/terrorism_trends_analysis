The Boeing Company would like to sell $600 million worth of its big jets to Libya, a spokesman disclosed last week. The trouble is the 1979 Export Control Act severely restricts such sales to countries ''supporting international terrorism,'' and Congress has blocked them in the past.
Boeing Co is seeking permission to sell jumbo jets to Libya
Peter Bush, the chief Boeing spokesman, said that his company asked the Commerce Department last month for permission to sell Libya's national airline a dozen planes, including a 747 jumbo jet, two or three of its new 767's and as many as five 737's. Under the rules for exports to Libya, Commerce can deny the license if it finds that the aircraft would increase Libya's ability to ''carry military cargo or troops or to conduct reconnaissance missions.''
Boeing, which recently laid off several thousand employees, could certainly use the money. But if Commerce leans toward granting the license, President Reagan could find himself taking a hard look at his priorities - he has vowed to punish Mr. Qaddafi for supporing terrorists.
If that pledge goes the way of the President's pipeline sanctions, it will be up to Congress to weigh distaste for Mr. Qaddafi against profits for American companies. Libyan-American relations were strained to the breaking point in 1980, when there were reports that Mr. Qaddafi had sent a ''death squad'' to assassinate Mr. Reagan.
