ZURICH, Switzerland-A public/ private partnership that would pool losses is the most promising way to provide terrorism insurance, a Swiss Reinsurance Co. report issued Thursday suggests.
The Swiss Re Focus Report, ''Terrorism-Dealing with the New Specter,'' says the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks demonstrate that terrorism risks increasingly meet fewer of the important criteria of insurability, ''particularly as it is impossible to accurately assess the probability and severity of terrorist attacks.''
As a result, Zurich, Switzerland-based Swiss Re concludes that terrorism risks are insurable privately only on a ''very limited basis.''
An effective state and private insurance program in the short to medium term should involve three elements, Swiss Re said:
* Mandatory direct insurance under which all property risks are automatically covered against terrorism risks
* A levy on current property premiums, which could be a fixed percentage or scaled according to exposure. Typically, in the United States a levy of 3% to 5% of property premium would be appropriate, Swiss Re suggests.
* A greater sharing of the loss burden by further aligning the interests of all parties-policyholders, insurers, reinsurers and government.
In addition, policyholders should carry a ''significant'' deductible of around 5% to 10% of insured values.
Insured losses would be pooled, and the pool reinsured beyond a given deductible by reinsurers, capital markets and governments, with the governments being the insurers of last resort. Such an approach would mean ''all stakeholders bear a portion of the risk relative to their financial capacity,'' Swiss Re said.
