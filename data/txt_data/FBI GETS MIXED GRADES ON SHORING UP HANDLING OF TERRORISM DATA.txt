The Federal Bureau of Investigation has made significant progress in its ability to analyze terrorism intelligence, but it still faces persistent problems in training and making full use of its analysts, the Justice Department's inspector general said in a report released yesterday.
 The FBI's failure to "connect the dots" on intelligence before the Sept. 11 attacks was seen as a critical shortcoming, and past assessments have found that the bureau's ability to pull together, analyze and quickly disseminate such intelligence was essentially broken.
In its new report, the inspector general's office offered a mixed assessment of the FBI's progress in shoring up its intelligence analysis. It found "significant progress in hiring and training quality analysts, although significant issues remain."
 One concern, it said, was that analysts continue to be underused at times and pressed into largely administrative tasks rather than reviewing important terrorism and intelligence reports.
 "Many analysts are still asked to perform duties that are not analytical in nature, such as escort, trash and watch duty," the report said. "As the name implies, escort duty is following visitors, such as contractors, around the FBI office to ensure that they do not compromise security. Trash duty involves collecting all 'official trash' to be incinerated. Watch duty involves answering phones and radios."
