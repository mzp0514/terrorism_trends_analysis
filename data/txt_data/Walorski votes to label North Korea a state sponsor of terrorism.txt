April 05--WASHINGTON -- U.S. Rep. Jackie Walorski voted for two resolutions aimed at labeling North Korea a state sponsor of terrorism on Monday.
According to a press release, the resolutions would also condemn the regime's efforts to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of carrying a nuclear warhead.
House Resolution 479, the North Korea State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act, would require the U.S. State Department to decide whether to formally designate North Korea a state sponsor of terrorism. It passed in the House by a vote of 394 to 1.
House Resolution 92 would condemn North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missile development program, which violates United Nations Security Council resolutions. The resolution passed by a vote of 398 to 2.
"As North Korea poses an increasing threat to our national security, it's time to call this rogue regime what it is: a state sponsor of terrorism," Walorski said in a statement. "With these measures, we are taking action to hold North Korea accountable and send a clear message that Kim Jong-un's illicit missile program and provocative maneuvers are unacceptable. Congress is committed to working with the Trump administration to confront this threat and keep America and our allies safe."
The measures both head to the Senate for further consideration.
