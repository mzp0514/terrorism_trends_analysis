VILLA RICA, Colombia - Assailants in pickups fired homemade mortars at a police station in this western town Thursday, killing at least six people and wounding more than 20, the regional police chief said.
The Cauca state police chief, Col. Ricardo Alarcon, said it was too early to assign blame.
But President Juan Manuel Santos and his defense minister both said they had no doubt the perpetrators were the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the country's main insurgency.
The 1 p.m. attack in this town of 15,000 people about 15 miles southeast of Cali, the country's third-largest city, came a day after a bomb planted in a tricycle killed nine people and wounded 76 outside a police station in the Pacific port of Tumaco as lunch hour was ending.
FARC rebels are active in both areas and their arsenals include homemade mortars. Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon blamed Wednesday's attack on the insurgents in league with a drug-trafficking gang.
"What is the FARC looking for?" Santos said as he toured Tumaco on Thursday. "Why do they speak in the language of peace but on the other hand commit acts of terrorism like this?"
The peasant-based FARC, which has been fighting a succession of governments since 1964 demanding a more equitable distribution of wealth, is seeking to open a peace dialogue with Santos.
But Santos insists the rebels must first halt hostilities and release 12 security force members whom the insurgents have held captive for more than a decade.
