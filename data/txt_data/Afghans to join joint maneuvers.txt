The United States and fractious neighbors Afghanistan and Pakistan will hold their first joint military maneuvers next month to boost cooperation in the war on terrorism.
U.S. forces have joined exercises with Pakistan's army, but the involvement of a small contingent of Afghan troops in the air-assault drills will be a first and is an apparent effort to patch up relations.
"We feel that it is important that the only way we will solve the terrorism and insurgency problem is to work closely together," Col. Laurent Fox, a U.S. military spokesman, said yesterday at a news conference in Kabul, the Afghan capital.
Afghan and Pakistani officials have accused each other of not doing enough to prevent Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters from crossing between the two countries. As attacks have escalated on both sides of the frontier, relations have plummeted.
Fox said the maneuvers, called Inspired Gambit, would take place at the border in May.
Military exercises are a sensitive issue in Pakistan, as the government forbids U.S. troops from carrying out offensive operations on its soil. More than 18,000 U.S. forces are based in Afghanistan, and forays across the poorly marked border have sparked diplomatic complaints and street protests in Pakistan.
The frontier has been the suspected hiding place of Osama bin Laden and his top deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, since late 2001, when the U.S.-led offensive ended Taliban rule in Afghanistan.
