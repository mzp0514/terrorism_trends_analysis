The United States is committed to a long-term partnership fighting terrorism in the Horn of Africa, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Tuesday. Leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea pledged support but struck no new deals on U.S. access.
Rumsfeld said that he did not come to this region to negotiate the use of military bases for U.S. forces, but he left open the possibility that the United States eventually would expand its presence.
The sea lanes in this region, where the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden meet, are increasingly important since they are used for commercial shipping and to move U.S. war materiel to the Persian Gulf, where U.S. forces are building up for a possible attack on Iraq.
Today, Rumsfeld is flying to the desert hinterland of Djibouti, which borders Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia near the Gulf of Aden, to visit hundreds of American troops stationed at Camp Le Monier, a French air base that has become the headquarters of a U.S. anti-terrorist task force.
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi told reporters after a palace meeting with Rumsfeld that members of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida network were filtering into the area, increasing the threat of terrorist acts in the region.
"Due to the migration of some of these people out of Afghanistan, things might have become a bit more serious in the Horn of Africa," Zenawi said in a joint appearance with Rumsfeld.
Earlier in the day Rumsfeld said, "I'm not here to put pressure on anybody. I'm here to demonstrate that the United States values what these countries are doing."
