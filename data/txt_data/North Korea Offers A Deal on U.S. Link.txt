The leader of long-reclusive North Korea has said he would open ties with the United States right away if it removed his country from a list of terrorism-sponsoring nations, South Korea's state news media reported today.
"The U.S. is putting a cap of a terrorist nation on us," the news agency Yonhap quoted Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader, as saying. "As soon as they remove it, we would open ties with the U.S. -- even tomorrow."
North Korea has been identified by the State Department as a sponsor of terrorism, making the government ineligible for most forms of American aid and ruling out bank loans from international organizations, many of which are heavily influenced by the United States.
The two nations recently held talks in Pyongyang, the North's capital, on removing the Communist North from the list. The State Department called the meeting "productive" but did not disclose details.
North Korea was put on the list of terrorism sponsors because of its suspected involvement in the bombing of a South Korean airliner in the skies near Myanmar, the former Burma, in 1987. All 115 people aboard the Korean Air plane died.
Mr. Kim's comments on ties with the United States came last week during a meeting with South Korean news executives, Yonhap reported. Mr. Kim invited the executives after meeting the South Korean president, Kim Dae Jung, in Pyongyang in June -- the first summit meeting between leaders of the two Koreas.
