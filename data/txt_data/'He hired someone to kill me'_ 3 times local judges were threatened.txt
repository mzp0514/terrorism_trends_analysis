An increase in the number of threats against local judgesâ€” the I-Team investigates what's being done to protect judges from acts of revenge, or attempts to influence rulings. And how these threats of violence are changing the way our courthouses operate.
WATCH: Jim Otte has the I-Team investigation Thursday, May 10, beginning at 5 p.m. on News Center 7.
 Recent local cases aren't the first time judges across the country have been threatened because of their jobs. Here are five times threats and acts of violence impacted judges:
 1. 2nd person indicted for threats against juvenile court judge
 A second person accused of making social media threats against a juvenile court judge was indicted by a Montgomery County grand jury. Marquan D. Cooper, 22, of Dayton, is charged with intimidation. READ MORE
 2. No indictment for man accused of retaliation against judge
 A man charged with allegedly threatening former Middletown Municipal Court Judge Melynda Cook Howard was not indicted by a grand jury. Timothy Wayne Abney, 41, of the 2300 block of Waneta Street, was charged with retaliation, a third-degree felony, in December for words he allegedly uttered after a hearing. READ THE FULL STORY
 3. Local judge receives death threat
 Montgomery County Common Pleas Court Administrative Judge Mary Katherine Huffman said she has received a death threat from a man who she had sentenced to prison for complicity to commit murder.
 "He was attempting, from prison, to hire someone to kill me, his intended victim and the prosecutor on the case," Huffman said.

 Huffman said judges are well aware of the security challenges they face, including death threats. "It really comes with the territory. I really have to say it's not the first one," Huffman said.
 Huffman and other judges in Montgomery County have begun taking a closer look at potential security improvements in the Common Pleas Court but have not said publicly what they might have planned.
 Nationally, there are even more examples of judges being threatened:
