U.S. Rep. Ginny Brown-Waite on Thursday angrily refused calls by a Muslim advocacy group to condemn Hernando County Commissioner Tom Hogan and his wife, Mary Ann Hogan, who called Islam a "hateful, frightening religion."
Brown-Waite instead blasted Ahmed Bedier, the executive director of Council on American-Islamic Relations' Tampa chapter, accusing him of anti-Catholic comments, saying he staged a 2004 political "ambush" of her meeting with a local doctor and has done little to condemn terrorism by Muslim extremists.
Brown-Waite also accused Bedier of saying: " 'Catholic priests pose more of a terrorism threat by having sex with young altar boys than those who flew the planes into the World Trade Center.' "
"That's a lie. She's twisting it," Bedier said Thursday. "I said we cannot stereotype and blame Islam for the actions of a few individual criminals, just like you cannot blame Catholicism for the actions of a few criminal priests."
Echoing Tom Hogan Sr.'s comments last week, Brown-Waite said Thursday, "It is an accurate truism that by far and wide not every Muslim is a terrorist, but it's historically accurate that every terrorist has been a Muslim with the one exception of the bombing of the Murrah building by Timothy McVeigh."
As for terrorist acts by the Irish Republican Army, Brown-Waite said: "That wasn't in our country."
Brown-Waite's letter follows more than a week of controversy surrounding the Hogans' comments.
While prominent state leaders and local politicians condemned the couple, the pair say they enjoy wide support from the community.
