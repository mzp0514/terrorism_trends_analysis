 So here we were, preparing to write yet another screed scorching Barack Obama for his nonchalance in the aftermath of the botched airline bombing on Christmas. Surely the president should have cut short his vacation in Hawaii and returned to Washington, we probably would have said. Then, we retrieved an item from Politico.com, in which Josh Gerstein explained:
 "Eight years ago a terrorist bomber's attempt to blow up a transatlantic airliner was thwarted by a group of passengers, an incident that revealed some gaping holes in airline security just a few months after the attacks of Sept. 11. But it was six days before President George W. Bush, then on vacation, made any public remarks about the so-called shoe bomber, Richard Reid, and there were virtually no complaints from the press or any opposition Democrats that his response was sluggish or inadequate."
 On the day it occurred, the Obama administration described the attempted attack on the Northwest flight from Amsterdam to Detroit as terrorism. According to Politico.com, Bush aides did not make the "same explicit statement" about the shoe bomber.
 Obama's approach to terrorism has its faults. His predecessor's record also was imperfect. His successor's will be, too.
