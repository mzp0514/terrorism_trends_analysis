John Reyna, officer with the Department of Public Safety at Southeast Missouri State University, has been selected to participate in the Missouri Counter Terrorism Officer Program.
 The Missouri Department of Public Safety, Office of Homeland Security selected Reyna after he was nominated by Ken Gullett, Captain of Police Operations of DPS, based on job performance and skill. 
"We identified John because of his work on building assessment review from crime prevention perspectives, work with active shooter training and military background, Gullett said. "This is a well-rounded training that helps in identifying risks and strengthening readiness." 
The training will help educate first responders about the critical role they play in the detection and disruption of potential terrorist actions in Missouri.  The goal of the Missouri Counter Terrorism Officer Program is to develop a group of law enforcement officers throughout the state that have received an advanced level of training in counterterrorism preparedness/response, large scale emergency preparedness, and intelligence gathering and sharing.  As recognized leaders with their respective agencies, training participants will then be able to bring this training back to their departments and share it with them.
