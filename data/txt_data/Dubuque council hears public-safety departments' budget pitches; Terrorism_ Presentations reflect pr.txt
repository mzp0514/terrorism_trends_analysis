The Dubuque City Council on Wednesday heard about the new roles public-safety departments are taking to prepare for terrorism incidents.
The Emergency Communications, Emergency Management, Fire, Health Services and Police departments presented their fiscal year 2003 budgets to the council at the Carnegie-Stout Public Library auditorium. The presentations reflected the departments' recent cooperative efforts to develop ways to handle acts of terrorism. Some programs have been initiated in a manner that will allow city staff to provide future training at minimal city expense. While the preparations require time and training, the 2003 budgets do not show significant costs for these.
The Emergency Communications proposed budget increased 12.5 percent from $$ @656,475 for 2002 to $$ @738,357 for 2003. The department's equipment maintenance leapt from $$ @2,049 in 2002 to $$ @20,656 in 2003. There also was a significant increase in office equipment rental. Mainly due to line charges, which the state bases on usage, the rentals went from $$ @24,000 in 2002 to $$ @38,400 in 2003. 
The center's calls recently have increased because of wireless 911 calls. When it first had the capacity to accept wireless calls, it received 49 wireless 911 calls. That grew to 962 in December - more than half the center's monthly calls, said Sandi Hutchcroft, emergency communications manager.
The city's portion of the Emergency Management Department's fees increased 26.3 percent from $$ @23,204 for fiscal year 2002 to $$ @29,318 for fiscal 2003. The department is moving away from using an accumulated balance for support. The balance provided $$ @25,147 for 2002. It will provide $$ @15,047 for 2003. 
The department's initiatives for this year include adding a section on terrorism to the Multi Hazard Plan. It also will prepare to help evacuate people who would need special assistance if a disaster occurs. It will compile information on where to find people with special needs and what help they need.
The Fire Department's proposed budget increased 6.9 percent from $$ @5,833,884 for 2002 to $$ @6,239,179 for 2003. It calls for $$ @112,300 of equipment replacements, including $$ @60,000 for defibrillators, $$ @20,000 for high-pressure rescue tools and $$ @6,000 for hazardous-material response gear. 
Later this year, the entire Fire Department will be trained by local firefighters to respond to terrorist bombings. It also will participate in a city- and county-wide terrorist incident drill.
The Health Services Department's budget increased 1.4 percent from $$ @392,062 in 2002 to $$ @397,679 in 2003. Health Services also is helping with potential terrorism and bioterrorism threats. 
"The whole effort has increased our partnerships with law enforcement, fire, everybody here tonight," said Mary Rose Corrigan, public-health specialist.
The Police Department's proposed budget increased 6.7 percent from $$ @7,048,518 for 2002 to $$ @7,521,987 for 2003. It includes $$ @271,049 for equipment replacement. This includes $$ @216,900 for 10 patrol vehicles, $$ @13,392 for body armor and equipment such as gas masks.
