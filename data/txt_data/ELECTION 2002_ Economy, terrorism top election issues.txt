A selection of polls on the Nov. 5 election:
 
* Public concern about the economy essentially even with concern about terrorist attacks, according to a CNN-Time poll released Saturday. In late September, this poll indicated that terrorism was a bigger concern, by a 56-33 percent margin.
From staff and wire reportsDemocrats had a slight advantage on which party would best handle the economy, by a 44-39 percent margin. Democrats, at 47 percent, were slightly ahead of Republicans, at 43 percent, among registered voters on the question of which party's candidate voters would support in the upcoming elections.
 
* A Newsweek poll also showed Democrats slightly ahead among registered voters, 43 percent to 41 percent. But among likely voters, the GOP has a narrow 46-43 percent lead.
 
* Democrat Frank Lautenberg, the former senator who replaced Sen. Robert Torricelli on the New Jersey ballot for U.S. Senate, leads Republican Douglas Forrester, 48 percent to 36 percent, according to a CBS-New York Times poll.
Torricelli dropped out of the race Sept. 30 because of questions about his ethics.
 
* Gov. Jeanne Shaheen has pulled about even with Rep. John Sununu in their race for the Senate in New Hampshire, according to a poll by American Research Group. The poll showed 48 percent support for Sununu, a Republican, and 46 percent support for Shaheen, a Democrat.
 
* Democrat Kathleen Kennedy Townsend and Republican Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. are running neck and neck among likely voters in the campaign for governor of Maryland, according to a Washington Post poll.
Ehrlich and Townsend each claimed the support of 47 percent of likely voters surveyed.
