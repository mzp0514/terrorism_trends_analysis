FBI Director Louis J. Freeh finds the nation's skies safer and its law enforcement authorities better prepared for terrorism almost a year after TWA Flight 800 exploded, setting off one of the largest criminal probes in U.S. history.
Although investigators are now leaning toward mechanical failure as the cause of the explosion, they have not entirely ruled out the possibility of a criminal act.
Freeh said initial fears that a terrorist might have blown up the Boeing 747 led to better airport security and stronger ties between the FBI and foreign governments.
"We have a better capability today, I think, to identify and prevent both domestic and international terrorism acts," Freeh said in a telephone interview during the weekend.
Freeh said the FBI investigation is in its final stages, scrutinizing holes in the skin and structure of the Flight 800 mockup. The agency expects to release its findings in 60 to 90 days.
"We are not at this point saying that we are ruling out any criminal act or act of terrorism," he said. "On the other hand, we have found no evidence of that. . . . Hopefully, in the end, there is no criminal part to this tragedy."
Today, investigators will conduct more tests. They've installed monitors on the fuel tanks of a Boeing 747 and will measure vibrations and temperatures under various conditions during a rigorous set of flight tests.
Paris-bound TWA Flight 800 exploded off Long Island shortly after takeoff last July 17 and fell in pieces over a five-square-mile section of Atlantic Ocean, killing all 230 people aboard. The wreckage sank 120 feet, leaving the FBI scrambling to preserve potential evidence.
