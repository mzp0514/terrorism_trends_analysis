I wanted to acknowledge the giant elephant in the room, which is that Americans are ever so slightly hypocritical about how they want the country to go about protesting things they believe in. Some may be upset with what I have to say but this needs to be heard.
First and foremost, our first amendment right states that we have the right to peacefully assemble and petition the government for a redress of grievances. In 2016, Colin Kaepernick peacefully kneeled during the national anthem in response to the racial injustices, police brutality and systemic oppression that Black people have been facing for years in America. Kaepernick kneeled because it was his first amendment right to protest to do so, but some football fans were angry because he "disrespected the country" or yet, a polyester flag that you can get from anywhere for about $13.
Next, Black Lives Matter protests then took it to the streets where 93% of those protests were peaceful marches around cities and towns. Yet, some Americans didn't like that and tried to call the BLM protestors a "terrorist group." Terrorism is the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives according to the FBI website.
