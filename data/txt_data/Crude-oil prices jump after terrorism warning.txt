Crude-oil prices in New York surged above $40 a barrel Thursday for the first time in more than a month after the Homeland Security Department signaled that terrorists are scheming to disrupt the fall's U.S. elections.
The rally reinforced the market's pattern of buying whenever terrorism worries surface, despite data showing builds in petroleum inventories last week.
"Credible reporting now indicates that al-Qaida is moving forward with its plans to carry out a large-scale attack in the United States in an effort to disrupt our democratic process," said Tom Ridge, the secretary of homeland security.
August crude futures jumped $1.25, or 3 percent, to settle at $40.33 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The rally was fed by a technical rise as prices neared the $40 benchmark as well as a slimmer-than-expected rise in U.S. commercial-oil inventories and the strongest demand for gasoline in four weeks.
Crude inventories increased only slightly on an uptick in refinery use, despite imports holding above 10 million barrels a day for the seventh consecutive week.
Also on the Nymex, wholesale gasoline for August delivery rose 5.43 cents to $1.3278 a gallon, the highest closing price in more than a month.
On the International Petroleum Exchange in London, futures for August Brent closed at $37.77, up $1.16 a barrel.
