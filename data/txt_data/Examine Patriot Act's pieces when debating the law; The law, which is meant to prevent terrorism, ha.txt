When the USA Patriot Act was passed by Congress in the weeks following Sept. 11, 2001, there was little discussion or fuss about it.
In the years following, however, even lawmakers who voted for the bill had questions about its scope.
This week marked the beginning of hearings on the bill, parts of which are due to expire at the end of the year under a sunset provision that lawmakers rightly put in place. It's important for lawmakers to carefully review the law this time around. It's equally important not to discuss the law in black-and-white terms so that it's not either vilified or deified as a whole.
It's not all bad. It's not all good. Much of the discussion about the law has been unfortunately polarizing, and that doesn't help the legislative process.
The Patriot Act has helped law enforcement agencies better share information with each other. It has updated laws to include modern technology. There are real concerns, however, that the law infringes on the civil liberties of regular citizens, and that shouldn't happen.
The law should be carefully reviewed - to ensure law enforcement can do its job but also to make sure a system of checks and balances is in place.
When lawmakers give the Patriot Act another go, they should discuss it in terms of its pieces and how those pieces are contributing to its intent as a whole.
