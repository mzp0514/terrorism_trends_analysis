The Republican Congressional leaders who oversee Department of Homeland Security operations reached agreement Thursday on a plan that would give federal officials the power to shut down high-risk chemical plants that do not comply with proposed new anti-terrorism measures for that industry.
  The proposal is more stringent than an industry-backed plan that many other Republican senators had already endorsed.
Under the agreement reached Thursday by Senator Susan Collins of Maine and Representative Peter T. King of New York, the regulations would apply to all high-risk plants, instead of just those defined as highest risk.
  The regulations would also give the Department of Homeland Security the power to review and approve plans devised by plant owners, to inspect facilities to determine compliance and to shut any noncompliant plants, according to a statement by Ms. Collins and Mr. King. To encourage Congress to enact more comprehensive regulations, they would expire after three years.
  It is not yet clear that this language -- which may be considered too stern by some Republicans and too relaxed by many Democrats -- will be approved by the full conference committee, which is scheduled to meet Monday evening on the department's budget. The provisions on chemical plant regulations are supposed to be inserted in that bill, with the goal of final approval of the measure next week.
