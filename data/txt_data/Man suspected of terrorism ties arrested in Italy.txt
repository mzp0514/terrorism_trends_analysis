PARIS - Italian police have arrested a Frenchman suspected of links to a network recruiting fighters for Afghanistan, a French official said Sunday.
The man was arrested in Naples in southern Italy in early September, based on a French probe underway for several months into alleged involvement in a terrorist enterprise, the official said. The official was not authorized to be publicly named because terrorism cases are classified.
The official said the man is suspected of having fought in Afghanistan and belonging to a network for recruiting fighters.
Two Italian newspapers say the man is 28 years old, of Algerian origin and suspected to be a member of al-Qaida.
Il Mattino, a newspaper based in Naples, and the Naples editions of La Repubblica said Sunday that the suspect had notes and a kit for making bombs when he was arrested. The French official, however, said the material seized was "insignificant."
Il Mattino said the arrest took place two weeks ago but only became public during a closed-door hearing in Naples that approved the suspect's extradition to France.
The arrest comes at a time of heightened concerns about a terrorist attack in Europe.
The U.S. government issued a travel alert Sunday.
