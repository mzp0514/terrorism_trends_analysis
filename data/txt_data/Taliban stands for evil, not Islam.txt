In May 2010 there was attack on two Ahamdi Muslim (minority sect in Islam) mosques in Lahore killing 80 people. In January 2013 militants bombers target the Hazara Shia Muslim minority in the City of Quetta leaving 120 dead. In September 2013 80 people were killed at a church in Peshawar. In November 2014 a bomb blast on the Whaga border between India and Pakistan left 50 people dead. This month a Taliban attack on school in Peshawar leaves at least 141 people dead, most of them were children – our children. 
How much more do we need to endure in the name of false and revolting beliefs? Terrorism, no matter where, has no religion. The Taliban and other proponents of these abhorrent acts have no right to claim that they stand for Islam — the religion of peace; they stand for pure evil. This is plain and simple brutality, taunting at the face of modern and noble humanity. 
This is the time to take definitive actions — not as a Muslim, Christian, Pakistani, American or other, but as humans standing together against all sorts of evil acts. No tolerance towards any type of terrorism, absolute rejection of all horrendous activities against humanity, no more acceptance of fanatic ideologies against any nation. 
I appeal to the sanity, humanity and dignity of all the people. Let's all get up and become a voice of reason and compassion in the uproar of hatred and abhorrence before it is too late.
