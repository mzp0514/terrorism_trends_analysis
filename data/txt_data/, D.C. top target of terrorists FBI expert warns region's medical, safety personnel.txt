WASHINGTON - The Washington metropolitan area has become "the No. 1
one target in the world" for possible terrorist attacks, a top FBI
expert on domestic terrorism warned a group of local law enforcement
officials, adding that the region's safety and medical personnel must
be ready to respond swiftly and work together to minimize deaths after
such a disaster.
Jim Rice, special agent in charge of the FBI's national capital
domestic response team, said downtown Washington receives three to six
suspicious packages a day that must be handled carefully by experts
trained to detect explosives as well as chemical and biological
weapons.
He also said the FBI has investigated 225 new cases of
possible chemical and biological terrorism nationwide this year, an
increase over the 181 new investigations that the bureau conducted all
of last year.
Speaking to about 100 police and fire officials from the District,
Maryland and Virginia Thursday night, both Rice and James C. Carter,
head of the FBI's Washington field office, said the nation's tough
stance against terrorism has angered terrorists around the world, who
now view the nation's capital as a primary target.
"Everyone in the world has looked at us through the cross hairs at
some time," Rice said.
Carter said the question about terrorism in the Washington area is not
whether, but when. By "going after terrorists," he said, the United
States has found many
enemies.
