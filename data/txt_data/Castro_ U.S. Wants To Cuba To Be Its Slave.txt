(RTTNews) - Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro on Friday criticized the U.S. administration for not removing Havana from its list of countries that support terrorism, saying that Washington wants Cubans to "return to the fold of slaves."
"Today they are willing to forgive us if we will resign ourselves to returning to the fold as slaves that, after knowing freedom, will accept again the whip and the yoke," Castro wrote in his May Day message published in official newspapers on Friday.
"The adversary should not have any illusion that Cuba will give up," he added.
Castro&apos;s remarks comes a day after U.S. retained Cuba on the list of countries regarded as "state sponsors of terrorism," which also includes Iran, Syria and Sudan. With the Obama administration making serious efforts to restore relations with Cuba, there were speculations that Cuba would be taken off the list.
President Obama recently lifted travel restrictions for Cuban Americans, but retained the 47-year old U.S. trade embargo on the communist nation, saying that it will not be lifted until the communist nation takes notable steps towards democracy, including the release of some 219 political dissidents currently jailed in Cuba.
Fidel Castro had ceded power to his brother Raul in February 2008, following an emergency stomach surgery in July 2006, and has made very few public appearances since then. However, his essays on Cuban and international politics appear frequently on government websites and state-run news agencies.
