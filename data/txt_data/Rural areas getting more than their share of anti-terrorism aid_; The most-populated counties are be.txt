Some government officials and security experts say that rural areas in Iowa are getting an unfair share of federal anti-terrorism dollars, according to a report in The Des Moines Register.
Of the first $$ @28 million coming to Iowa, $$ @250,000 will go to the city of Des Moines - where the population of 198,700 people is larger than any Iowa county outside its own. Meanwhile, largely rural Sioux County, with 31,600 residents, will get $$ @299,000 from the federal grant. 
While some small counties plan to use the federal money to purchase things like traffic cones and paper shredders, law enforcement officials in Des Moines say they can't afford helmets for their officers.
An analysis by the newspaper found that Iowa's five largest counties - Polk, Linn, Scott, Black Hawk and Johnson - while home to 33 percent of the state's population, are combined getting 15 percent of the federal grant money.
Polk County, with 13 percent of the state's residents, is getting 4 percent of the total dollars. The first anti-terrorism equipment requests to the federal government include $$ @6,700 in traffic cones, signs and barricades for Warren County; $$ @21,000 for six squad car cameras in Fayette County; $$ @4,500 in night-vision equipment in Dickinson County; a $$ @500 underwater camera for Decatur County, and a $$ @370 wall clock with a built-in hidden camera for Howard County. 
Other counties plan to spend grant money on megaphones, pagers, work gloves, rubber boots and paper shredders.
Sioux County officials said they were delighted to get $$ @299,000 in grants, but Mark Dunlop, Sioux County's emergency management coordinator, acknowledged that Iowa's homeland security money might be better spent in the state's bigger cities. 
"I would be the first person to agree, when you talk about a terrorist threat, that a city like Des Moines is much more vulnerable," Dunlop said. Des Moines, he said, "is a much more realistic target than somewhere in Sioux County."
