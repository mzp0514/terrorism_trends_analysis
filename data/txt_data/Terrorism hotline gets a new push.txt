Calling the public's help invaluable in the fight against terrorism, state officials plan to launch an advertising campaign for a toll-free hotline.
New Jersey State Police have followed up on more than 4,000 leads from calls made to police departments and through the state's hotline at 1-866-4-SAFE-NJ, according to law enforcement authorities.
Of those tips, 136 came from the hotline this year, said Capt. Al Della Fave of the state police.
Police now hope to increase the public's awareness of the hotline through a series of radio spots, billboards, and ads on NJ Transit trains. The campaign will be launched at the end of the month, security officials said. The cost was not immediately known.
"There is so much going on out there," said Sid Casperson, head of the state Office of Counter-Terrorism. "It helps us to keep on top of it."
The hotline number is posted on highway signs when the risk of a terror attack is elevated. It is also listed on the state's Homeland Security Web site, but there has been no widespread advertisement of the hotline.
Authorities would not provide details about how many investigations were prompted by leads from the hotline because of the confidential nature of such probes. They said the public's help is vital in the fight against terrorism.
"Without a doubt, the future [success] of law enforcement really rests with the help of the community," Della Fave said.
Terrorists involved in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington lived in New Jersey. The Prudential building in Newark was recently named as a potential target by federal homeland security officials.
