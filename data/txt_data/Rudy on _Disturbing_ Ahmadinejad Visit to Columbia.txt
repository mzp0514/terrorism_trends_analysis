Here's what Rudy told ABC'd5s Portland affiliate, WMTW in Maine today about Mahmoud Ahmadinejad speaking at Columbia. (As sent out by the Giuliani campaign.)
"I think it'd5s highly inappropriate that Columbia University asked him to speak. ...  [H]is  government of Iran is considered to be the single  biggest state sponsor of terrorism in the world.  There is very, very strong  evidence that they are giving materials and arms and smuggling people that are  leading to the slaughter of American troops and others who are fighting for  freedom and democracy.  He'd5s denied the Holocaust; he'd5s threatened the future  survival of Israel.  I believe he'd5s even  threatened at various times American interests and he keeps threatening to  develop nuclear capacity.
"So this is not even a close  question.  Literally thousands and thousands and thousands of people would want  to have the right to go to Columbia and speak.  ... So a choice had to be  made, which seemed to me the choice would be made not to bring ... the leader of  one of the governments that'd4s one of the biggest supporters of terrorism in the  world. ... [I]t'd5s very, very disturbing and I think that'd5s why you see such an  outcry against it."
