WASHINGTON (AP) - A decision by France to return three Mirage fighter-bombers to Libya is raising concern at the State Department.  The partial lifting of a French arms embargo was linked by the department to an accord Libya signed in August for a peaceful settlement in Chad.
Libya and France were on opposite sides in a war in the African country.  The department said Libya was supporting rebels in violation of an explicit prohibition in the agreement.  Also, the department said in a recent statement that Libya continued to pursue development of chemical weapons and to support terrorism.  France decided earlier this month to return to Libya three French-made supersonic Mirage fighter-bombers that had been held after being returned to Aerospatiale factories for repairs in 1986.  Foreign Ministry sources in Paris, requesting anonymity, said the return of the three aircraft - one Mirage F-1 and two Mirage-5's purchased in 1970 - did not conflict with a decision by the European Community in 1986 ruling out the delivery of new armaments to Libya.  The sources said the return of the planes was authorized following the Aug.  31 agreement for a peaceful solution to the border dispute between Libya and Chad.  But the State Department said, ''We are quite concerned and disappointed with this decision. We do not believe that now is the time to weaken sanctions against Libya.'' The statement said Libya had not demonstrated concrete changes in its policies of supporting terrorism and destabilization.
