TO THE EDITORS:
I am certain the following will upset a lot of people and, if so it will have accomplished its purpose.
It is time to tone down the political rhetoric and encouragement of acts of violence that are so prevalent from some of our politicians and radio and news media personalities and yes, even ourselves.
I think it would be very easy to assess our current media climate by some of these individuals that espouse their own brand of venom mixed with hate and half truths as close to terrorism in itself.
Encouragement of "acts of violence'' does not belong in political debate in our country. It does not belong in any form in our country. It also does not belong in e-mail or other Internet posts that are so prevalent. Those who write this drivel or forward these posts to others are just as much to blame as the violent attackers themselves.
These people are spreading "terrorism'' and are part of the problem and not the solution. And don't hide behind your right of "freedom of speech.'' This right does not include threats against other people or even hints of threats that may encourage others to do bodily harm to someone.
And don't hide behind your religious beliefs. If you profess belief in Jesus, but don't live your lives according to his words and example, you are not living a Christian life.
I think it is time for personal reflection, by a lot of people, of what you really stand for and what you really want this country to be like in the future.
