NORTHWOOD, Iowa -- A Kensett teenager has been charged in connection with a bomb threat Wednesday at Northwood-Kensett High School.
Ashton E. Trenhaile, 16, 4336 Raven Ave., Kensett, is charged with one count of threat of terrorism, a Class D felony, according to Northwood Police Chief Leo Dorsey.
Trenhaile allegedly made bomb threats by email to the school Wednesday. He is a student at the high school.
He was taken into custody after a search warrant was executed at his residence Wednesday night, Dorsey said.
Trenhaile was taken to the Waterloo Juvenile Detention Center where he is being held.
Assisting Northwood Police in the investigation were Manly Police Department, Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation, Worth County IT/GIS Department, Northwood Fire Department, Worth County Emergency Management Agency, Iowa State Fire Marshal's Office and the Worth County Sheriff's Department.
Public or private?
Juvenile records generally are more public in Iowa than they are in other jurisdictions, such as Minnesota.
However, in both states, when a person 16 years of age or older is charged with felony offense, it is always a public record.
