The Obama administration's story regarding the attack in Benghazi has changed more often than a teenager's excuse. Spokesmen were quick to blame a spontaneous reaction to a movie that slammed Islam. The street had risen! The U.S. denounced the slur against the religion.
More sober minds noted that the assassins used weapons seldom associated with rioting. Certain observers attributed the atrocity to al-Qaida, which may have used the movie as a pretext to doing what it had planned to do. Libyan officials have spoken of organized terrorism.
Mitt Romney endured heavy hits for his criticism of the administration's handling of the situation. This space voiced discouraging words about Romney's partisan boilerplate. The changing tune from the White House makes Romney seem a model of statesmanship.
When Islamists killed a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans, the Obama network shot from the hip. It appeared more eager to placate foreign constituencies than to report the truth. The implications of a terrorist strike may have been more troubling than Washington wanted to confront. The administration confronts an additional reckoning. It apparently was warned about the threats to security but did nothing.
Circumstances such as these prove difficult for officials to explain. The best answer would have been for Obama and his acolytes to have said, simply, "We do not know the details but we will find them -- and tell Americans what occurred and what we will do to counter them."
