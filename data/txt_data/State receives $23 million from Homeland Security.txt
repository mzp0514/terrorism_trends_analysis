Nebraska is getting more than $23.6 million in federal money to prevent and react to acts of terrorism.
U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge on Friday announced $2.5 billion in grants nationwide to help first responders and support resources to prevent and respond to terrorism and other disasters.
Of Nebraska's $23.6 million, the state gets $18.5 million under the Homeland Security Grant Program, to be used for equipment, training, planning and exercises, and Omaha gets an additional $5.1 million as part of the Urban Area Security Initiative, a program that provides additional resources to areas with greater security needs.
The urban grants are based on a variety of factors, including population density, critical infrastructure and threat information.
Nebraska already has received millions in federal money to protect against terrorist attack.
In October, state director of homeland security and Lt. Gov. Dave Heineman said about $71million in federal and state aid had been used for terrorism-related programs and equipment since the 2001 terrorist attacks.
The money has helped create a statewide public health system and a statewide public health communications system. It also has been used to improve emergency communication systems across the state.
