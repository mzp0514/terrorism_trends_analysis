A man arrested in Cedar Rapids last fall in connection with the federal-terrorism investigation has been charged by federal authorities with Social Security card conspiracy along with a Chicago man.
Youssef Hmimssa, 30, already faces federal charges of document fraud in Detroit where is currently being held and is scheduled to go to trial in April.
U.S. Attorney Charles Larson announced Friday that Hmimssa and Brahim Sidi have been charged with one count of conspiring to provide false information to the Social Security Administration. The charge is contained in an indictment filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Cedar Rapids.
The indictment alleges that Hmimssa and Sidi provided false information to obtain Social Security account numbers and cards.
If convicted, they face up to five years in prison or a $$ @250,000 fine or both. 
The case was investigated by the FBI.
The indictment alleges that Sidi, who listed a Chicago address, paid the first month's rent and a security deposit on Hmimssa's apartment in Cedar Rapids in the summer of 2001, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert L. Teig, who will prosecute the case.
Hmimssa had also been driving Sidi's car while he was in Iowa, the indictment alleges.
Hmimssa was arrested Sept. 28 in Cedar Rapids, where he was living under the name Michael Saisa.
Federal agents began looking for him after a raid at an apartment in Detroit, where he once lived, yielded a cache of false documents, including his photo with the alias Michael Saisa.
Sidi is in custody in Chicago.
