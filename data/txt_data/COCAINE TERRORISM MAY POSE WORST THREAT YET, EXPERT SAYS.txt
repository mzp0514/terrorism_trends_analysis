Colombian drug lords pose a terrorist threat to Americans that may prove greater than that of the more-familiar Middle Eastern terrorists, an expert on terrorism says.  ''In some ways they are even more insidious, because we don't know what the limits of the narco-terrorists will be,'' Thomas J. Miller, director of the Counter-Terrorism Office at the U.S. State Department in Washington, said here.
Miller said terrorists in Lebanon, for example, were motivated by politics and generally had refused to take women or children as prisoners.  But the Colombian drug cartels, motivated purely by economics, have shown disregard for their victims.  ''They will strike at anything that gets in their way, that interrupts their economic pipeline,'' said Miller.  Miller spoke Tuesday on ''Terrorism, Hostages and the Middle East'' at St.  Louis University. The lecture was sponsored by the School of Business and Administration and the Institute of International Business.  In an interview after his speech, Miller said he believed that in recent years the United States had improved its security against terrorists.  ''Does that mean we've solved the problem?'' he asked. ''By no means.'' The increasing use of hard-to-detect plastic explosives used in the downing of the Pan Am airliner over Scotland last December continues to pose a danger, said Miller. Costly equipment to detect the explosives is being installed at 100 ''high-risk'' airports around the world, he said.
