 WASHINGTON - Nearly 10,000 foreigners from states sponsoring terrorism have obtained permanent residency in the United States in the past seven years, congressional investigators say.
 The State Department Bureau of Consular Affairs did not implement a recommendation to bar immigrants from those countries, says the report from Congress' Government Accountability Office.
 Of countries designated by the State Department as sponsors of terrorism, 3,100 Iranians, 3,700 Sudanese and 160 Syrians have come into the United States through the special diversity visa program. The State Department has taken steps to strengthen program security.
 Fraudulent visa activity in other countries in the program also is a problem. The GAO report cited the ease with which people can obtain genuine identity documents in any assumed identity, including passports.
 Loggerhead sea turtle populations dropping
 WASHINGTON - After encouraging gains in the 1990s, populations of loggerhead sea turtles are dropping, primarily because of commercial fishing, according to a federal review.
 The report stops short of recommending upgrading the federally threatened species to endangered status. But scientists and environmentalists say it should serve as a wake-up call.
 The Southeast - Florida in particular - is one of the largest loggerhead nesting areas in the world.
