OMAGH, Northern Ireland -- Prime Minister Tony Blair, standing near the spot where a bomb killed 28 people, said today that he was recalling Parliament to enact new legislation intended to lock up terrorists.
Blair said both houses of Parliament would be recalled next Wednesday and Thursday, at the same time the Irish Parliament meets in special session to debate similar steps and just before President Clinton's visit to Northern Ireland.
Under the proposed laws, suspected bombers and gunmen could be jailed for belonging to an illegal organization based on the testimony of a police officer. A suspect's refusal to answer any question during interrogation could be used as corroborating evidence.
The government also will ask Parliament to pass legislation making it an offense to conspire in Britain to commit terrorist offenses in another country.
This legislation "has been strongly pressed upon us by many states who are concerned at what they believe to be U.K.-based nationals of their countries using the U.K. to plan terrorist acts abroad," Blair said.
The domestic anti-terrorist legislation would apply only to specific organizations.
"The days of the men of violence must be consigned to the past where they belong," Blair said, standing at the crossroads bombed on Aug. 15 by the so-called Real IRA, a splinter group which has refused to join in the Irish Republican Army's cease-fire.
