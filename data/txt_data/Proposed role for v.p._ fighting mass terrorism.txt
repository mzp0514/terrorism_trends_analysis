WASHINGTON -- A government panel proposes yet another role for the vice president: stopping the threat of weapons of mass destruction.
Describing "a chilling new reality" for Americans, the commission set up by Congress to assess federal response to the threat of nuclear, chemical and biological attack concludes that the top levels of government are "not effectively organized to combat proliferation."
In a report to be issued next week, it proposes a "special role" for the vice president in overseeing federal response to the danger and appointment of a "national director to combat proliferation."
The director would coordinate diplomatic steps to stop the spread of such weapons and direct a high-level, heavily funded program to prevent the targeting of Americans and respond adequately to any attack.
Carefully avoiding criticism of the current or any other administration, the panel headed by former CIA Director John Deutch recommends strong presidential and vice presidential leadership, a single budget for the effort and changes in several federal agencies.
The Commission to Assess the Organization of the Federal Government to Combat the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction presents its 140-page report to Congress next Wednesday, but commission members discussed their findings in interviews Thursday.
