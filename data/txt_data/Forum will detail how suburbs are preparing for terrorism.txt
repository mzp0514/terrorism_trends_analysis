What is being done in the Northwest suburbs to prepare for a terrorist attack?  
The answers will be given during a public information forum Tuesday night titled, "Terrorism Emergency Preparedness," which runs from 7 to 8:30 p.m. at Carl Sandburg Junior High School, 2600 Martin Lane, Rolling Meadows.  
The event, hosted by State Rep. Suzie Bassi, will feature a panel of local officials talking about what measures are being taken in the Northwest suburbs to ensure the public's safety in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.  
A question and answer session will follow the presentation.  
Panelists include officials from Northwest Community Hospital, the Cook County Department of Public Health, a disaster specialist from the American Red Cross, and police and fire chiefs from Palatine and Rolling Meadows.  
Bassi decided to organize the event because so many people are frightened about the possibility of more attacks and are curious to know how local government agencies and hospitals would respond in a crisis.  
"It's so people can have a comfort level," Bassi said.  
The forum also will offer guidance to parents on how to talk to their children about terrorism-related issues.  
For more information, contact Bassi's office at (847) 776-1880.
