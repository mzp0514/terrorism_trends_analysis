Donald Rumsfeld, the United States special envoy to the Middle East, conferred with Israeli leaders today, but Israel made no commitment on allowing the evacuation of Yasir Arafat and his guerrillas from Lebanon.
Mr. Rumsfeld, who arrived Thursday night from talks in Damascus with Syrian leaders, met alone with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir for 70 minutes. Mr. Rumsfeld said later, ''Any comment might harm my mission.''

But Defense Minister Moshe Arens said tonight that Israel could prevent the Palestinian evacuation and would reconsider its attitude to the pullout only if Mr. Arafat promised to abandon terrorism.
(Mr. Rumsfeld told Israeli television that Syria might agree to discuss the withdrawal of its troops from Lebanon at talks in Geneva on Lebanese reconciliation next week, The Associated press reported.),
A senior Israeli official, speaking about the evacuation of Mr. Arafat and his 4,000 Palestine Liberation Organization fighters from the northern Lebanese port of Tripoli, said, ''I should like to again make it absolutely clear that Israel has given no commitment on the evacuation of the terrorists from Lebanon.''
Israel also said it intended to maintain pressure on Mr. Arafat by sending in gunboats to attack guerrilla strongholds north and south of Tripoli.
