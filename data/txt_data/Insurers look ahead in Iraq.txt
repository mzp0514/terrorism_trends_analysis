AMID ALMOST DAILY reports of attacks by insurgents, we think the insurance industry deserves credit for continuing to underwrite risks in Iraq.
As we report on page 1, personal accident coverage for the approximately 15,000 foreign civilians working to rebuild that war-torn country is getting more expensive.
Not only are rates sharply increasing, but underwriters are also tightening terms and conditions.
Following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, most of the global insurance market quickly backed away from covering terrorism-related losses. In the United States, it took the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, which provides a federal reinsurance backstop for catastrophic acts of terrorism, for the coverage to become widely available again. The price is high, but insurers are not charities.
While a backstop similar to TRIA exists under the Defense Base Act, in which the federal government pays for losses from acts of war or terrorism, insurers that write workers compensation risks in Iraq still face hefty claims.
Noble and humanitarian as the reconstruction may be, not all efforts to rebuild Iraq are necessarily altruistic. As we've noted before, risk and opportunity are sides of the same coin. Businesses stand to make a lot of money when Iraq's infrastructure is restored.
The insurance industry is playing a role in that recovery, and in fact some international insurance leaders are helping to rebuild Iraq's own insurance market. We're under no illusions, though, that this can be done quickly. It will take years for Iraq's economy to become healthy.
But we also think that the groundwork being laid now, with the help of the insurance industry, to make Iraq a stable, self-governing nation will pay big dividends in the future.
