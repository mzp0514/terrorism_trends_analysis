In letter to his Turkish counterpart, France's Foreign Minister, Jean Francois-Poncet, expressed ''great indignation'' over the killings and said ''all necessary efforts'' would be taken to punish those responsible.
Turkey's Prime Minister, Adm. Bulent Ulusu, who returned tonight from a Persian Gulf peace mission, expressed confidence that France would handle ''such deplorable incidents'' properly.
The terror campaign by several Armenian groups has taken the lives of 17 Turkish diplomats, their relatives or aides since 1973. The terrorists are seeking retaliation for the killing of Armenians under Ottoman rule during World War I and are demanding the creation of an Armenian nation.
