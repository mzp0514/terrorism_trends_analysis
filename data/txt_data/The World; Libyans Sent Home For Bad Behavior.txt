Every day, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya sells 640,000 barrels of oil to the United States, and gets back $25 million, or more than $8 for each Libyan man, woman and child. Too often, in Washington's view, this wealth has financed ''provocations and misconduct, including support for international terrorism.''
State Department orders closing of Liby'a mission in Washington, expels it staff membersSo last week, the State Department ordered Libya's mission in Washington to close and expelled its 27 staff members.
The volatile Colonel Qaddafi, who once sought a pipeline to the White House via Billy Carter, usually works one side of the international street -promoting revolutions in the Middle East and Africa, bankrolling terrorists and stockpiling $12 billion of Sovietmade weapons. He preaches Arab ''steadfastness'' against Israel and, with the help of East German ''advisers,'' sent Libyan troops into neighboring Chad to defeat a French-backed regime. Eight Libyan dissidents were murdered in Europe last year and many of the 4,000 Libyans in American schools received threats. A Libyan student was shot and wounded in Colorado in October.
After a mob burned the United States Embassy in Tripoli in December 1979, the staff was called home. That left 2,000 Americans - mainly oil company employees - without consular protection. Last week's expulsion may prompt retaliation, but with storage tanks overflowing, United States officials believed damage from a cutoff of Libyan oil would be slight.
