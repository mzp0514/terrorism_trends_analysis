(RTTNews) - Describing Kashmir as the root cause of tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi, Pakistani Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani Sunday called for a speedy resolution to the decades-old issue over which the nuclear-armed neighbors have fought two wars, media reports said.
Addressing a press conference at Islamabad on his return from the World Economic Forum (WEF) at Davos, he said Kashmir was the "root cause" of the tensions with India and that a solution to Kashmir was tied to regional stability.
"Whenever we met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, we said that all issues must be resolved, including the issue of Kashmir, so that we can focus our attention on the common challenges faced by the two countries," he said.
Gilani expressed disappointment that the Kashmir issue was not included in the mandate of U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke, who has been given the charge of only Afghanistan and Pakistan.
"Until Kashmir is on the agenda, when you talk about terrorism, a problem comes up because when there is talk of self-determination or &apos;azadi,&apos; it gets bracketed with terrorism and that becomes a problem," he said.
Earlier, during his election campaign U.S. President Barack Obama had specifically spoken in terms of stepping up U.S. engagement in Kashmir, but after the verbal rebuke British Foreign Secretary David Miliband received from Indian politicians for his unwanted comments on Kashmir, the United States preferred to err on the side of caution with New Delhi in the appointment of a special envoy to the region.
