 President Muhammadu Buhari has declared that Boko Haram insurgents no longer have control of any part of the country.
He said this in Beijing, China, while addressing some Nigerians residing in the country as he attributed the successes to operations of security agencies deployed to counter insurgency in the North-eastern part of the country.
'You will all recall that we contested the last election basically on three issues, which includes security, especially in the North East,' he said.
'The Boko Haram used to occupy quite a number of local governments in Borno State but they are not in anyone now'.
He, however, stated that the insurgents have resorted to other strategies to carry out their terrorist activities.
'They have resorted to a very dangerous way of terrorism by indoctrinating young people, mostly girls and attacking soft targets, churches, mosques and marketplaces,'' he said.
On the herders and farmers crisis in the country, the President blamed the clashes on the shrinking of the Lake Chad, which according to him, has forced many cattle nomads to seek greener pastures for their herds in other parts of the country.
He, however, said security agencies are doing their best to curtail the crisis.
He also called on the media to complement the efforts of the government by disseminating balanced and accurate information to the public at all times.
