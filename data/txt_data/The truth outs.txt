New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie got boatloads of ink in March by decrying as "disturbing" the NYPD's absolutely legal gathering of intelligence in Muslim neighborhoods in his state.
Well, his own administration, after a three-month review, has now found that the Police Department broke not a single law, civil or criminal, in conducting its anti-terrorism operations.
We knew that, as should anyone with an ounce of sense.
The NYPD used public records - online maps, census data and the like - to gather basic profile information in various neighborhoods. It listened in on open sermons delivered in mosques.
All with good reason.
Around the world, radical Islamist ideology has been fomented not only in target cities, but in surrounding suburbs and towns - as in New Jersey - where local authorities are not equipped to identify or head off terrorist threats.
(Don't forget that some of groundwork for the 9/11 attacks was laid right there in the Garden State.)
What the NYPD did was nothing like "spying," which is how an Associated Press series smeared it. It was typical intelligence-gathering - the kind any responsible law enforcement agency should do when faced with a profound, complex threat.
Now, Christie's own attorney general, Jeffrey Chiesa, has vindicated the department.
"Based on what we saw, their conduct was permissible," the Newark Star-Ledger quoted one official as saying. "There was no evidence of illegal wiretaps or search and seizures. We're not seeing any violations of law."
Let those be the last words on this. Except maybe - don't hold your breath - apologies by those who made a sport of knocking around the NYPD.
