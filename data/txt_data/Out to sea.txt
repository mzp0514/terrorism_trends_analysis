An aircraft carrier will not be moving from its homeport in Hampton Roads to Florida. President Obama's budget does not include funds for the shift.
Virginians welcomed the news. Floridians said the project has been put on hold.
Supporters say they want to disperse the fleet to defend against terrorism, and to minimize disruptions caused by hurricanes. Critics counter that Hampton Roads already serves as the world's pre-eminent naval base. Why alter the happy arrangement?
The decision to keep the carriers in Virginia may have as much to do with dollars as with national security. Although The Times-Dispatch understands the defense budget's contribution to Virginia's prosperity, decisions regarding security should be based solely on ... security. We trust that is what happened here. We commend the state's delegation for making the military case for Hampton Roads.
During his tenure at the Pentagon, Dick Cheney reminded local officials that he served as secretary of defense, not as secretary of economic development. As Virginians cheer the carrier news, they ought to appreciate his point.
