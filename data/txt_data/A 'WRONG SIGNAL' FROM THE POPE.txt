To the Editor:
 In 1933, Eugenio Cardinal Pacelli (later to become Pope Pius XII) negotiated a concordat with Adolf Hitler. The Nazi Government never even pretended to honor this treaty, and in 1937 Pope Pius XI denounced the National Socialist regime and its theories in the encyclical ''Mit brennender Sorge.''
Fred Ehrman letter comments on Pope's meeting with PLO leader Yasir Arafatope John Paul II will also regret his meeting with the leader of a violent political faction. If the Pope truly has compassion for the Palestinian people, giving legitimacy to Yasir Arafat, a foremost leader of worldwide terrorism, is the wrong signal.
The P.L.O., as demonstrated in its covenant and by its indiscriminate murders and assassinations of innocent civilians, is sworn to the destruction of the State of Israel, with which the Vatican still has no diplomatic relations. Mr. Arafat, as the leader of the P.L.O., is responsible for the slaughter of tens of thousands of Christians during the P.L.O.'s occupation of Lebanon.
The Pope would be making a real contribution to peace if he would encourage moderate Palestinians to enter negotiations with Israel within the Camp David framework.  FRED EHRMAN Chairman, Israel Commission, Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations New York, Sept. 15, 1982
