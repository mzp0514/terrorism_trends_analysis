President Bush, meeting with leaders of Kenya and Ethiopia, yesterday expressed his condolences for last week's attacks on Kenya, and pledged to join with the Horn of Africa nations to combat terrorism.
Flanked by President Moi of Kenya and Prime Minister Zenawi of Ethiopia in the White House Cabinet Room, Mr. Bush said, "We welcome two strong friends of America here.
Two leaders of countries which have joined us to fight the global war on terrorism."
Mr. Bush's meeting with two of Africa's most prominent leaders was planned before last week's twin attacks on Kenya's Indian Ocean coast that killed 10 Kenyans, three Israelis and three bombers.
Mr. Bush said America will share intelligence with both countries if their citizens are threatened by terrorists. "The best thing we can do to help secure your countries is to help chase the killers," the president said.
The Kenyan leader replied that security is the most important issue facing the Horn of Africa. Mr. Zenawi of Ethiopia told Mr. Bush, "I appreciate your support and leadership."
Mr. Zenawi told reporters afterward that he and Mr. Bush had discussed drought relief, though the two leaders did not mention specifics.
Dozens of protesters chanted anti-Zenawi slogans outside the White House gates, and surged after his mini-motorcade as it left. They carried signs that said, "Meles Zenawi's terrorist regime must end" and "President Bush, don't reward a terrorist!"
