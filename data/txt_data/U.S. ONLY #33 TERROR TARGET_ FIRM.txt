WASHINGTON- Somalia and Pakistan top the global list of terror targets, while the U.S. ranks No. 33, a new report found.
The U.S. faces only a "medium risk" of attack, according corporate security firm Maplecroft's new Terrorism Risk Index. America had previously been ranked No. 46 in the company's survey of at-risk nations.
The epicenter of violent terrorism shifted between June 2009 and this summer to Somalia, where 556 incidents mostly involving the Al-Shabaab "youth movement" left 1,437 dead, Maplecroft reported.
The firm studied actual terror attacks as well as the potential for mass casualties in plots such as that of the failed Times Square car bomber Faisal Shahzad.
Iraq and Afghanistan were deemed third- and fourth-worst countries for terror attacks. Israel checked in at No. 14.
Regionally, central and East Africa, South Asia and Russia are at greatest risk of Islamic terrorism.
Colombia remains the only Western Hemisphere country at "extreme risk" because of narcoterrorists.
The biggest new Islamic terror threat has been the rise of Somalia's Al-Shabaab. The group has not hatched any known efforts to attack the U.S., despite recruiting dozens of Americans.
Still, the Homeland Security Department last week banned all air cargo from the lawless country.
