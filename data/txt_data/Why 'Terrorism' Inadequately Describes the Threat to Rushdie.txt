To the Editor:
On Feb. 21 a columnist named Norman Podhoretz, writing in The New York Post, attacked me for defending Salman Rushdie while not meanwhile renouncing my view that the word ''terrorism'' is too vague and too ideological to be of any use. He referred his readers to an essay I published in 1986.
On Feb. 24, a columnist named A. M. Rosenthal, in The New York Times, attacked ''a journalist named Christopher Hitchens'' for defending Salman Rushdie while not meanwhile renouncing his view that the word ''terrorism'' is too vague and ideological to be of any use. He referred his readers to an essay I published in 1986.
It's become commonplace lately to ridicule people for excoriating work that they obviously have not read, but not even the most ill-intentioned reader of my essay could deny that I lampooned the word ''terrorism'' for being, among other things, a euphemism. That, I argued, was part of the diminishing return that resulted from its politicization by hypocrites. The threat to Mr. Rushdie, for example, ought to be denounced not with some stale generalization but for what it is - an attempt at contract killing and an incitement to murder; something rather novel on the international scene.
