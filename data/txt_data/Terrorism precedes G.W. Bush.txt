TO THE EDITOR: Its evident that Charles Eshleman, who alleges in his recent letter to the editor that George Bush is responsible for the fomentation of all the evil of terrorism in the world, either is too young to know what has been going on in the world for the last 40 years or is so old he has forgotten what has been reported about terrorism in the newspapers. Here are a few instances of terrorism that many of us remember. In 1968 Bobby Kennedy was shot and killed by a terrorist. In 1972 at the Munich Olympics, a number of athletes were kidnapped and massacred by terrorists. In 1979, the U.S. embassy in Iran was taken over by terrorists. During the 1980s, a number of Americans were kidnapped in Lebanon by terrorists. In 1983, the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut was blown up by terrorists. In 1985, the cruise ship Achille Lauro was hijacked and a 70-year-old American passenger was murdered and thrown overboard in his wheelchair by terrorists. In 1985, TWA flight 847 was hijacked at Athens, and a U.S. Navy diver trying to rescue passengers was murdered by terrorists. In 1988, Pan Am Flight 103 was bombed by terrorists. In 1993, the World Trade Center was bombed the first time by terrorists. In 1998, U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed by terrorists. And, on Sept. 11, 2001, four airliners were hijacked, two were used as missiles to take out the World Trade Centers and of the remaining two, one crashed into the US Pentagon and the other was diverted and crashed by the passengers.
