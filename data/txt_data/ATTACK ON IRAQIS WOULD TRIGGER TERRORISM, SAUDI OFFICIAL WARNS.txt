RIYADH, Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Prince Saud, said Thursday that an attack on Iraq by the United States would anger the Arab world and spawn more terrorism.
Saud pointed to an attack this week in Kuwait in which two gunmen killed a U.S. Marine and said more like it would follow if military action were launched against Iraq without destroying terrorist groups first.
The gunmen, who were shot dead, were "connected to terrorists," said Saud. "You're adding something new for the terrorists to target in doing this (attacking Iraq) before you finish the war on terrorism."
Still, he said Saudi Arabia would cooperate with any U.N.-approved effort to address Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, even one calling for use of force even though the kingdom will not participate in any attack.
Asked by a reporters whether he believed Saddam has weapons of mass destruction, Saud said: "I think the threat is there and and the way to remove that threat is to have the inspectors back to do their job."
When asked if Saudi Arabia would send a clear "no" to the United Nations if asked for the use of its territory in a strike against Iraq, Saud said: "We are not going to join in the military action, but if the United Nations takes a decision in this, we will cooperate with it."
"We will cooperate with the United Nations actions like every other country, (but) not as a member of the forces that will be undertaking missions for the United Nations," he added.
