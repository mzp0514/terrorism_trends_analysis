ORONO — A specialist on the modern history of the Middle East will be the Schonberger Peace and Social Justice Memorial Lecture Series speaker April 14 at the University of Maine.
Ian Lustick, the Bess W. Heyman Professor of Political Science at the University of Pennsylvania, will present “Time, Israel, and the Demise of Developed States: The ‘Solutions’ that History Provides," at 7:30 p.m. Thursday, April 14, in 100 Neville Hall. Lustick also will deliver a luncheon talk earlier in the day, “American Foreign Policy and the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict,” at 12:30 p.m. in the Bangor Lounge in the Memorial Union as part of the Socialist and Marxist Studies Series.
Both talks are free and open to the public.
Lustick has written six books and dozens of articles that appeared in major academic journals. He has received numerous awards and grants, including from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Science Foundation and the United States Institute of Peace.
Lustick is known for his 2006 book, “Trapped in the War on Terror,” in which he argues that the war against terrorism is an irrational policy for fighting America's enemies. He maintains that the war on terrorism was initially conceived of by neoconservatives determined to shift the direction of U.S. foreign policy toward unilateralism.
