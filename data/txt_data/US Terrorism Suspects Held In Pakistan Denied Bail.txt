(RTTNews) - A Pakistani court has denied bail to five American nationals arrested on suspicion of conspiring to carry out terrorist attacks.
Defense lawyer Tariq Asad said on Wednesday that his clients will appeal to a higher court for release from custody.
He complained that the defense was not given access to evidence and police records.
The young students from the US state of Virginia have not been charged since they were arrested in December from a house in the eastern city of Sargodha, home to one of Pakistan&apos;s biggest air bases.
Pakistani Police said emails showed the five men were plotting terrorist attacks in the country with the help of Islamist extremist groups.
The suspects claim innocence, saying they had wanted only to provide fellow Muslims with medical and financial support days after their families reported them missing in Virginia.
Two of the suspects are of Pakistani origin and the three others of Egyptian, Yemeni and Eritrean descent. They could face lengthy prison terms if found guilty.
They accused the US and Pakistani authorities of torturing and threatening them with death while in custody.
