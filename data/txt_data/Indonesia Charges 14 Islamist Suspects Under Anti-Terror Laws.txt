(RTTNews) - Indonesian authorities Thursday charged 14 Islamist suspects under anti-terrorism laws, following their arrest while they were allegedly undergoing military training in northern Aceh province. Officials believe the arrested are to be members of a previously unknown terror group.
"We&apos;ve been able to prove that they planned a series of terror attacks," a police spokesman said in the capital Jakarta. The military training of the suspects included "physical exercise and the use of firearms to prepare the planned terror attacks," he added.
The men were arrested over the past 11 days after the police raided a camp in Aceh Besar, a remote region of northern Sumatra island, where around 50 militants were being trained, police said. While four suspects were arrested during the raid, the remaining were arrested in follow-up raids in which one was shot dead while trying to escape.
Under Indonesia&apos;s counter-terrorism laws of 2003, a conviction for planning a terrorist attack carries prison terms up to 20 years.
Aceh was home to the now-disbanded Free Aceh Movement (GAM) separatist nationalist Islamist group, which became a political party following a 2005 peace agreement and now has members running local governments.
