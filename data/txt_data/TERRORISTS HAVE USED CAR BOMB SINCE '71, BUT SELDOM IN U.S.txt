The phenomenon is well-known in Belfast, Lima, Bogota and Beirut, but if the explosion that rocked New York's World Trade Center on Friday was indeed caused by a car bombing, as the FBI believes, it would be the largest such attack in U.S. history, experts said.
Not since 1975 has anyone used a bomb, delivered in any fashion, to kill so many civilians in the United States.
It was unknown whether a terrorist group might have been responsible for the explosion Friday.
"This is the largest scale bombing on U.S. soil in modern history" in terms of fatalities and material damage, said Brian Jenkins, a security consultant with Kroll & Associates who is one of the nation's leading private experts on terrorism.
But if the U.S. setting is novel, the apparent use of a vehicle as a platform for the bomb is only the latest use of a favorite tool for terrorists.
Ever since the Irish Republican Army first used the car bomb in 1971, Jenkins and other experts said, terrorist groups have found no better way to bring so much explosive power so close to a target. And law enforcement officials have found no sure way to discern whether a parked car might be a weapon.
"Think of how simple it is," said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism specialist with Rand Corp. "Think how many people pull into a garage or park on a street, lock their cars and then walk away. Nobody pays attention, and it happens every day."
