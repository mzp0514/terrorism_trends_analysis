Cruises on eBay for $1.88?
No, that's not a typo. London-based easyCruise,
the maverick budget line, really is auctioning off
cruises on eBay this week starting at just 1 pound
(about $1.88). The 1-year-old line's initial auctions —
a first for a cruise line — are for last-minute space on
upcoming Italian and French Riviera sailings, as well
as for riverboat trips in Holland
and Belgium. The company plans
to add auctions for Caribbean
cruises in a few weeks in an ongoing effort to sell
through the site. Details on the offering are on USA
TODAY's cruise blog at blogs.usatoday.com/
cruiselog.

Love soars, terrorism intrudes on trips
The threat of terrorism plays an increasing role
in where people choose to go on vacation, according
to TripAdvisor.com's just-released annual trends
survey.
A hefty 61% of travelers weigh terrorism risks
when choosing a vacation destination, according to
the e-mail survey of 3,927 members of the Trip-
Advisor community worldwide. That's up from
52% last year.
On a lighter note, love — not just fear — is in the
air. Six percent of respondents say they were asked
on a date or started a romantic relationship with a
stranger while on a flight, up from 4% in last year's
survey.
Twenty-six percent of travelers say they dress
more provocatively on vacation. And 18% say they
have had to invoke the famous Vegas slogan after a
vacation. That is to say, whatever happens in (fill in
the destination) stays there. For the hotel side of the
survey, visit blogs.usatoday.com/hotelhotsheet.
