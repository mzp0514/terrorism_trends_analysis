Kashmir: American aid could be cut off
WASHINGTON (AP) - The United States warned Pakistan on Thursday that it could be branded a sponsor of terrorism - making it ineligible for virtually all U.S. aid - if it gave direct support to a terrorist group that operates in Kashmir.
The State Department also was sharply critical of the military-run government of Gen. Pervez Musharraf for requiring judges to take a loyalty oath.
"This move by General Musharraf undermines the integrity and independence of the judiciary in Pakistan," spokesman James P. Rubin said.
On Wednesday, six Supreme Court justices refused to take the oath, which would shield the military from legal action.
"Gen. Musharraf needs to make clear in a comprehensive fashion how he intends to return Pakistan to an elected government with a functioning legislature and an independent judiciary under a democratic constitution," Rubin said.
President Clinton is expected to decide soon whether he will include Pakistan in a March trip to India and Bangladesh.
Earlier this week, Clinton and the State Department said there was no evidence Pakistan supported the hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane in December.
Rubin said at the time the hijackers might have been linked to a terrorist group that operates in Kashmir.
The group, known as Harkat ul-Mujahedeen, was placed on the department's list of terrorist organizations in 1997 when it was called Harkat ul-Ansar.
