The state House of Representatives was scheduled to vote on 25 bills and resolutions today and Tuesday dealing with terrorism.
Among the bills being considered by the House is one passed a year ago in the Senate, written by Sen. Gibson E. Armstrong, a Refton Republican.

Armstrong's "Son of Sam" bill has been amended to include harsher penalties for suspected terrorists.
The original bill made it impossible for a criminal to write a book about his crime and benefit from its earnings.
Armstrong's bill was amended to allow for more severe penalties against defendants if prosecutors can prove that the offense was an act of terrorism. The penalty could be an additional 10 years in prison and an additional fine of up to $100,000.
"Most of the action government can take to prevent terrorism is on the federal stage, but if there is any way we can plug some holes, we should," Armstrong said.
He explained that the House wants to move the process along so using a Senate bill that has already passed would skip a step in the process.
Armstrong added that he hoped the original intent of the bill stays in, but he's glad to have a hand in getting an anti-terrorism bill into law.
If the bill passes it must go to a joint House and Senate conference committee to reconcile the differences between the bills passed in the House and the Senate.
