A letter that is part of a cache of documents secured from Osama bin Laden's Pakistani complex and released to the public on Thursday reveals that the organization paid close attention to American media and rated it based on each outlet's ability to transmit their message.
The note, written in January 2011 and excerpted in the Wall Street Journal, details spokesman Adam Gadahn's feeling that all American television news outlets were more or less on the same level of fairness except for Fox News, which he said, "falls into the abyss as you know, and lacks neutrality too."
Gadahn had praise for CNN's Arabic version, which he said often uses the wording placed in their videos and press releases; the English language CNN, he said, seemed to cooperate closely with the United States government.
The letter takes issue with MSNBC's firing of Keith Olbermann and Octavia Nasser, prior to which he believed the network was relatively fair. Gadahn also speaks highly of CBS's 60 Minutes, saying that the news magazine was quite respected, while also praising ABC News' terrorism expert, Brian Ross.
Gadahn ponders whether to offer networks an exclusive interview with Bin Laden, and ultimately proposes that, should they not come to an agreement with a specific network on an exclusive, they send a video to "CBS, NBC, and CNN and maybe PBS and VOA [Voice of America].
"As for Fox News," he writes, "let her die in her anger."
