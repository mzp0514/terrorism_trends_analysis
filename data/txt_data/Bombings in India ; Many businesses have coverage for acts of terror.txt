Bomb blasts in two Indian cities could trigger sizable claims for local insurers and foreign reinsurers.
More than 300 people have been killed and buildings have been severely damaged by at least 14 bombs that have exploded in Bombay and Calcutta during the past two weeks.
In Bombay alone, insured damage to buildings and vehicles is expected to total between 300 million and 400 million rupees ($ 9.6 million and $ 12.8 million), according to local sources. Estimates for losses in Calcutta were not available last week.
About 300 people were killed in Bombay by 13 explosions. More than 500 were injured. Among the buildings damaged were the Bombay stock exchange, the Air India building and some high-rise buildings at Nariman Point.
In Calcutta, about 50 people were killed in a single bomb blast last week. The explosion damaged two residential apartment buildings.
Property insurance policies in India do not normally cover damage caused by terrorist attacks.
However, policy extensions covering damage due to rioting include coverage for terrorism.
Many Indian businesses extended their coverage to include damage from riots and terrorism after they incurred losses during riots last year, sources say.
The nationalized local insurance industry is expected to retain about half of the losses, with most of the remainder being reinsured with London and continental European reinsurance markets.
Indian insurers currently are negotiating April 1 reinsurance renewals.
