SALEM, Ore. -- Classified information indicates there are people in Oregon linked to the Sept. 11 terrorism, Sen. Gordon Smith said, the first time such a connection has been made publicly by a high-ranking official.
"I have reason to believe that there are some finding aid and comfort here in the state of Oregon who have been a party to terrorist activities that found ultimate expression in New York City," the Republican said Monday.
Smith declined to provide details, saying they were classified, but said he didn't expect anyone to "pull the trigger in Oregon." He did not say where he got the information.
The FBI, Gov. John Kitzhaber's office and the state Attorney General's office would not discuss specifics of Oregon's role in the nationwide anti-terror investigation.
Previously, no one of authority has publicly drawn a direct connection between the terror attacks and potential suspects in Oregon. Of the 1,200 people who have been arrested or detained across the nation since the attacks, none are held in Oregon.
Beth Anne Steele, the FBI's spokeswoman in Oregon, said "We know of no direct threats in Oregon."
The FBI has said that the terrorists' infrastructure stretched throughout the country, particularly in terms of fund raising, but Steele would not say whether that infrastructure is thought to have extended into Oregon.
