(RTTNews) - On the eve of the G-20 summit meet in London, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown told his Indian counterpart Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Wednesday that most of the terrorist attacks in Britain have their origins in Pakistan, reports say.
With the precarious situation in Pakistan set to figure prominently in Thursday&apos;s summit of the G-20 leaders in London, Brown said the issue of terrorism in Pakistan needs to be dealt with firmly and that "something needs to be done about it." The British premier said he would continue to engage with Pakistani authorities to work together with the international community to confront the problem of terrorism.
Brown made the comments at the fag end of a meeting that lasted over an hour at his office at 10 Downing Street, Indian Foreign Secretary Shivshankar Menon told reporters.
The British premier&apos;s observations came soon after Singh--who earlier landed in London to attend the G-20 meet on the global economic crisis--described India&apos;s nuclear-armed neighbor as the "epicenter of world terrorism," and a country that was either "unable" or "unwilling" to crack down on Islamic militant groups operating with impunity from its soil.
In an interview to &apos;Financial Times,&apos; he said that Islamabad continued to fail to take effective action against militants, and was either "unable" or "unwilling" to clamp down on the militant groups, like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) that New Delhi accused of carrying out the November 26 Islamic terrorist attacks in Mumbai.
