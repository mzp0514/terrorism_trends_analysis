Authorities said 21 people remained in critical condition after a rampage at the iconic London Bridge and a nearby market that left seven dead and dozens more injured on Saturday night.
I'm thankful we have a president who gets it. We dodged a bullet with Hillary Clinton. Terrorism will only stop when we eliminate the threat of radical Muslims altogether.
Frank Monroe
Terrorism is an idea -- so how do you destroy an idea? Can you ban it or build a wall around it? Obviously not.
It can be overwhelmed by a better idea but it will never be completely destroyed.
So many more innocent Muslims are killed by other Muslims, who use their perversion of Islam as an excuse for killing, compared to non-Muslims who are killed by acts of terror. Islam is a religion of 1.6 billion people and, as with most religions, those people can be of any race. You can't tell who is a Muslim by looking at them. Yes, there could be millions of terrorists who are Muslims and that would still only be a small percentage of the total.
In the end, fighting terrorism in a way that creates more terrorists is counter-productive. We could purge the U.S. of every Muslim and build a wall around the nation and there would still be terrorism. But we would sacrifice who we are as a nation to do so. We would no longer be the land of the free but become the home of the fearful.

London is a city of defenseless sheep circled by wolves when people don't have gun ownership rights. The people need to be armed and protect each other from terrorists. This is beginning to look like World War II all over again.
Karl Hicks
I feel so sorry for the victims and everyone in London. America is standing with you to defeat these bad guys.
