Recently, while looking through the calendar, I glanced at the date, Nov. 11, and I wondered how many Americans would even pause to remember the day set aside to honor our veterans.
At the moment, many weak-minded Americans are suffering with a self-induced rage against anything that is remotely patriotic. They refuse to understand how very important our military is to the survival of our country.
Those on the radical left are always eager to demonize our military, our flag and our patriotism. Their adolescent-style tantrums are reminiscent of the anti-everything mentality during the 1960s.
In this age of rampant terrorism, many Americans still don't get it. We are protected from the evils of global insanity by military heroes who keep America safe and our freedom alive.
I once traveled to Dover, England, which will always be remembered for the bravery of its people during World War II. I was fortunate to speak to a local woman who told me that her grandfather fought alongside American troops during the war and that he praised our GIs for fighting heroically to help protect the people of war-torn Europe. She recalled that her grandfather often said that if it wasn't for the Americans, the map of the world would look a lot different.
It's sad to realize that our global neighbors show more respect for our men and women in uniform than many people here at home.
On Veterans Day and every day, our nation's military deserve our respect and gratitude for their service.
