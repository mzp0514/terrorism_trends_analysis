The Feb. 15 headline "Hezbollah Threatens Retaliation" on Page A-4 might be a concern if it were not so laughably offensive. Since Hezbollah and Hamas and Syria and Iran and all their ilk have wanted to constantly wipe Israel off the map since it was created in 1948, why did the PG find this "threat" newsworthy enough to put it in large bold type at the top of the international page?
What makes this bellicose stance any different than the last 247 antagonistic warnings? Why should this be any more ominous than the Palestinians' daily bombings of Sderot, which were not in "retaliation" for some specific alleged "attack"? Islamo-fascists need no excuse to kill every Jew and Westerner they can menace.
These terrorists just echo the years of antagonistic threats by Palestinian militants since long before Israel's generous ceding of Gaza, assassination of a top commander, etc. Israel just wants to be left alone to peaceably exist in its tiny land surrounded by numerous larger Arab nations.
Regardless of whether the underdog Jewish state trades land for peace, frees hordes of Palestinian terrorists with Israeli blood on their hands, pulls out of the West Bank, which it took only in self-defense, or does any other act of concession, it will clearly never satisfy Islamo-fascists who want to wipe Israel off the map entirely.
