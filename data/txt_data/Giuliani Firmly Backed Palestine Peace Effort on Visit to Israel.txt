To the Editor:
Re "The Mayor's Clumsy Visit," your editorial of March 12:
Representing the New York Jewish Community Relations Council, we were pleased to accompany Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani on his recent trip to Israel. We were there -- Kenneth J. Bialkin, Judah Gribetz, Michael S. Miller, Merryl H. Tisch and I -- to show solidarity with the Israeli people during their period of grief -- the true purpose of the journey.
Mr. Giuliani was warmly received at each of nearly 20 stops on the 36-hour itinerary. In our view, the remarks he offered at every venue were substantive, sincere and sensitive. They were not "clumsy." It was evident that he was moved, as were we, by the specter of the physical and emotional devastation wrought by terrorism and murder.
Rather than "injecting himself" or intruding "in the delicate business of the peace effort," the Mayor was consistent in his firm support of both the peace process and Israel's efforts to combat terrorism.
His comments regarding Yasir Arafat, which were in response to a question from an Israeli reporter at a news conference, were reflective, not critical, of current Israeli policies in holding the Palestinian Authority responsible for combating terrorism.
