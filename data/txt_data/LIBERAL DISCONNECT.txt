The Dec. 18 letter by Liane Ellison Norman ("Scared to Death") should have been printed on the funny pages rather than in the Letters to the Editor. When she contends that global warming is a more pressing issue for the United States and the world at large than terrorism, she illustrates the disconnect between extreme liberalism and common sense.
I expect that, if the worldwide coverage of 9/11 or the subway bombings in Spain do not convince one of the immediate dangers of terrorism, then nothing will. One does not need a doctorate to understand the priority of human life when you have such compelling evidence.
The only group that warrants nearly the disdain as the terrorist is the intellectual liberal as they do their best to change others while keeping their lifestyles intact.
They are full of advice, though they fall far short on personal action. They sell books written on dead trees yet chide the logging industry. They teach in institutions heated by natural gas and funded by fuel taxes yet scold oil companies. The real inconvenient truth is that this Republican drives a Toyota Corolla to do my part while Al Gore flies in private jets which expel more harm in one trip than does my Corolla all year.
When Ms. Norman writes of a free nation's need to work with terrorists to solve global warming, I hope she, herself, has volunteered for a trip to Afghanistan or Iraq to do so! I'll pledge $100 to send her.
