Imphal: The National Investigation (NIA) shall set up 3 more branches in Imphal, Chennai, and Ranchi, an official confirmed to reporters on Monday (September 28).
The official said that the opening of 3 more headquarters will help in responding quickly to any emergent situation in the concerned states by the premier anti-terror investigation agency.
He further added that this development will also strengthen the NIA's capability in the investigation of terrorism-related cases and other national security-related matters.
Currently, the NIA has nine branches in Guwahati, Mumbai, Jammu, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Kochi, Lucknow, Raipur, and Chandigarh besides specialized units at the headquarters in New Delhi.
The decision to open three new branches will help in accomplishing its main vision -- to effectively fight terrorism and strengthen the anti-terror response framework, he added.
Meanwhile, calls for a new NIA branch have intensified. Bharatiya Janata Party MP Tejasvi Surya on Sunday claimed that Bengaluru has become an epicentre of terror activities and said he has requested Union Home Minister Amit Shah to set up a permanent division of the investigation agency.
Surya's claim was backed by the state's CM Yediyurappa who said the Karnataka capital has become a hub of criminal activities in the recent past.
