Secretary of State Warren Christopher registered U.S. and Israeli concerns  about international terrorism with President Hafez Assad and surveyed  prospects for "some sort of an understanding" of peace between the two  countries.
Sunday's five-hour meeting evidently produced few concrete results beyond  an announcement by Christopher that he would return to the region in  September.

A senior U.S. official said Assad listened carefully to complaints about  the fundamentalist group Hezbollah but did not give "any set of responses."
Jubran Kourieh, a spokesman for the Syrian president, said Assad told  Christopher his country was serious about the peace process.
Hezbollah is believed responsible for attacks on Jews in Buenos Aires,  London and possibly Panama. It has also dueled with Israel over the border  from Lebanon, where Syria is the dominant political and military force.
The United States and Israel consider Iran primarily responsible for  Hezbollah's attacks. But Rabin said last month in Washington that Syria could  do more to prevent the flow of weapons to the fundamentalist group.
Christopher appealed for greater restraint on all sides, saying the  violence could damage peacemaking in the region, which Christopher has now  visited four times in the past three months.
However, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Israel would never  forego "any military measure that is necessary for defensive purposes." 
The assertion came against a backdrop of growing border tensions. Two Israeli  soldiers died Saturday in a clash with Hezbollah gunmen.
