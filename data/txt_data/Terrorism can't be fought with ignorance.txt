There is no set formula for handling tragedies like the recent terrorist attacks or other senseless acts of violence. Emotions and tensions are running high because of the recent terrorist attacks and many Americans are having trouble dealing with the sheer enormity of the situation.
Oklahoma State U.
As America rushes off to fight a war against an enemy that has no single country, it is time to take a step back and attempt to place things into perspective.
That was one of the purposes of a panel discussion title "Responding to Terrorism" held in the Student Union Little Theater by The Friends of the Forms Tuesday night.
The discussion was an opportunity for everyone in attendance to gain other options to responding to terrorism and allowed them to ask questions concerning recent events. The discussion featured informed, educated and experienced panelists who could offer the public the best weapon against terrorism, another perspective.
While there is no set way for the public to handle a terrorist attack, it is always best to be well-informed and have a better perspective than those who commit such terrible attacks. Expressing our own views and gaining more knowledge about the views of others may be the thing that many Americans need right now.
America will recover from the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, but it will take more than time and money to heal our wounds and our nation's wounds. The healing process will only be hindered by ignorance and blind hatred.
