Several explosions at an Ariana Grande concert are believed to be the work of terrorists, with at least 19 people killed as thousands of terrified concert-goers ran for the exits in the chaos in a Manchester arena, police said Monday.
At least 50 people were injured, and photos from the scene showed carnage as scores of ambulances and paramedics rushed to the area. Grande, who was just finishing her performance  around 10:35 p.m. local time, was not among the injured.
The Greater Manchester Police Department reported via Twitter that the agency was treating the explosions as a terror attack.
Eyewitnesses told local television the concert was just wrapping up when thunderous explosions could be heard. Manchester Arena holds 21,000 people, according to its website.
Locals took to the Facebook page of the Greater Manchester Police Department to offer free rides and even their homes to panicked concert goers.
Witness Kiera Dawber tearfully told CNN that there was a "massive, massive explosion" followed by a chaotic scene of screams, shouts, and shoes and handbags  flung about, and about 20 bodies strewn on the floor of a hallway. "You could see straight off that they were just dead," Dawber said.
Outside, traffic was at a standstill as fleeing concert goers ran through the streets, Dawber said.
