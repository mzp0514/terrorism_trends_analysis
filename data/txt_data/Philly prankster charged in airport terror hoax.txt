A birthday prank that spiraled out of control has resulted in federal terrorism charges for a Philadelphia man. 
 Kenneth W. Smith Jr., 26, allegedly called police at Philadelphia International Airport on Sept. 6 and claimed that a passenger was trying to smuggle explosives on a flight to Texas.
 The intended victim of the terror hoax, Smith's friend Christopher Shell, was celebrating his 29th birthday. Shell was aboard a US Airways flight to Dallas-Fort Worth, only 30 minutes out of Philadelphia, when the plane was ordered to return to the airport. 
 On an isolated portion of the runway, Shell was led from the plane in handcuffs and into a waiting car. A bomb-sniffing dog was taken on board the plane but found no explosives. Shell was cleared, reboarded, and the aircraft took off more than three hours after its scheduled departure time.
 Smith was charged by federal authorities today with making malicious false information about an explosive and false information and hoaxes, announced U.S. Attorney Zane David Memeger. If convicted, Smith faces up to 15 years in prison, a fine of up to $500,000 and restitution costs to the airline.
