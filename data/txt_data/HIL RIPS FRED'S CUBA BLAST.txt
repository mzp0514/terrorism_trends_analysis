REPUBLICAN Fred Thompson hasn't even officially declared he's running for President, but Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton didn't wait to jump on him for implying that some Cubans are involved in terrorism.
Last week in South Carolina, Thompson - an actor and former Tennessee senator - warned that an immigration bill could leave the U.S. open to terrorism: "I don't imagine they're coming here to bring greetings from Castro. We're living in the era of the suitcase bomb," he said.
Clinton, in Florida yesterday for a candidate forum with Latino elected officials along with other top Democratic candidates, seized the opportunity to run Thompson down for the comment.
"I was appalled when one of the people running for or about to run for the Republican nomination talked about Cuban refugees as potential terrorists," she said. "Apparently he doesn't have a lot of experience in Florida or anywhere else, and doesn't know a lot of Cuban-Americans."
Florida, with a primary that has been moved up to late January, has become increasingly important in national elections. The state has a large Latino population, and many Cuban-American voters have leaned Republican.
After his Cuban comment hit the Web, Thompson - who has had healthy showings in GOP primary polls - moved to clarify it in a blog posting, saying he was referring to Cuban spies as a possible threat, not to regular immigrants.
