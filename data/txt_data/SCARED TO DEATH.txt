The United States is mobilized, holding its breath, taking off its shoes, giving up its civil liberties because terrorists might strike something in our country. We're scared to death, which is just what the Bush administration wants as it repudiates our understanding of the Constitution to aggrandize its unaccountable power.
But the real danger is not terrorism, though there certainly are nasty terrorists who would bomb and kill civilians. (The United States, waging what it calls a "war against terrorism" has joined the terrorists, incinerating innocent bystanders.)
The real danger is global warming, the damage we have done to our planet by greedily exploiting the world's natural resources. We have so upset the Earth's protective atmosphere that it is changing rapidly and will so alter sea levels, agriculture, species and climate that we humans will be beset with consequences that will greatly reduce our chances of survival.
These dangers have been proved: Those who dispute them are, in some way, dependent on profitable despoliation and power as the Earth flames out. They seem unable to imagine that what will happen to the least of us will happen to all of us.
We and those we call terrorists have a common interest, which is to buckle down to finding -- and finding quickly -- less destructive ways to live on our shared planet.
