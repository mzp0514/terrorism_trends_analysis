After a nomadic decade that carried him from the Australian outback to the battlefields of Afghanistan, David Hicks ended up locked away at this remote U.S. base in Cuba, accused of training with al-Qaida and fighting for the Taliban.
Now, more than five years since he was hauled to Guantanamo Bay, the former kangaroo skinner is expected to get a chance to contest those allegations.
Hicks, 31, is scheduled to be arraigned today on a charge of providing material support for terrorism. He is the first Guantanamo detainee charged under new rules for military trials, or commissions, adopted after the Supreme Court cast aside the previous system in June.
One of his attorneys, Joshua Dratel, dismissed as U.S. "mythology" that the Australian is a terrorist who threatened the U.S.
The U.S. military originally had charged Hicks with attempted murder, aiding the enemy and conspiracy to attack civilians, commit terrorism and destroy property.
But those charges were dropped.
Military documents depict Hicks - a high school dropout who converted to Islam in 1999 after returning from Kosovo, where he fought on behalf of Muslim Albanians seeking independence from Serbia - as somewhat of a hapless holy warrior.
Hicks spent weeks trying to join the fight in Afghanistan but apparently failed to win the confidence of his al-Qaida associates, according to the documents.
He finally reached the front lines in Afghanistan two hours before they collapsed. His menial assignments along the way included guarding a tank.
