As we draw close to commemorating 9/11, let's leave the grieving to the families who actually lost those near and dear to them. This one act of real terror on American soil, other than our daily murder rate and the Oklahoma City bombing, has now become an excuse for self-indulgence among many in our country.
Meanwhile, in other parts of the world, terrorism is an almost daily occurrence. Consider many places in Africa and Asia where thousands have been murdered in acts of terror. Think of Israelis and Palestinians who target each other in needless acts of terror. Remember the Lebanese who have lived for decades with ongoing terrorism. Especially, think of the Iraqis who now live in a worse state of terror due to Bush's war than they did under Saddam.
As published in The Tribune, 1,809 civilians were killed there in June and 1,760 in July. Since data was first collected in 2005, 27,564 Iraqi civilians have been killed, many by American bombs or American "mistakes" as a result of Bush starting a war linking 9/11 to Saddam's Iraq, a totally false assumption. We would like to blame these deaths all on sectarian conflict, but we must acknowledge the Iraqis' right to grieve.
