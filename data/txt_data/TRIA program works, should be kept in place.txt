A RECENT GOVERNMENT report on the state of the terrorism risk insurance market bolsters the case that risk managers and insurers have been making for years: that federal terrorism insurance backstop is critical to ensuring the availability and affordability of the coverage.
As we report on page 3, the President's Working Group on Financial Markets found that the terrorism insurance market has improved since the panel made its last report in 2006. Although the report suggests policymakers should review parts of the program to encourage greater private sector involvement, it noted that stakeholders told the panel that the backstop encourages insurers to provide sufficient affordable terrorism cover they might otherwise decline to offer.
The report should be considered carefully in light of the Obama administration's call for a scaled-back program to cut government spending. That's a bit disingenuous, given that the program has cost next to nothing and that insurers would repay any government assistance. Any savings merely would be accounting tricks.
Even though some of the improvement in the marketplace reflects general conditions for property insurance, there's no guarantee that such buyer-friendly conditions will persist forever. The working group report shows the current program has worked, and worked well.
Keeping the program intact and in place after its slated 2014 expiration will help guarantee coverage will be available if it is needed in the wake of future terrorism attack.
