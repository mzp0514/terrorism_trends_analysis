PARIS - Alerted by a cryptic warning of attacks unless France pulls its troops from Afghanistan, police found an old pack of dynamite sticks Tuesday in the restroom of a top Parisian department store.
The explosives at the Printemps store lacked detonators, and the message didn't fit the profile of Islamist groups such as al-Qaida. Still, the discovery renewed worry over terrorism, especially in the holiday season.
Shoppers and employees were noticeably rattled, and the scene was chaotic as police evacuated people from the department store in late morning. French television showed women clutching one another or crying as they left the store under a line of police tape.
"Of course, I was scared. ... I was just relieved to get out," said Printemps employee Jimmy Manso, as he waited to go back inside.
Interior Minister Michele Alliot-Marie announced plans to tighten security in Paris and other large cities, and called a meeting today with police chiefs, intelligence and transport officials and department store representatives.
Some 1,500 police reinforcements had already been brought in ahead of the holiday season, mostly to patrol around department stores.
"France will not cede to the terrorist threat," Prime Minister Francois Fillon said.
President Nicolas Sarkozy, who has increased troop levels in Afghanistan and made a surprise visit there a year ago, called for vigilance but said, "We cannot compromise with terrorists." France has 2,800 troops in Afghanistan.
