THE terror attacks in London last week, in which bombs tore apart three subway trains and a double-decker bus, raise a number of questions about the nature and future of the struggle against terrorism.
  Here are a few.

How will the attack affect Prime Minister Tony Blair's standing in Britain, and as a European leader?
   Among his European peers at the Group of 8 summit meeting, the attacks produced a public display of solidarity, but in private European leaders who had opposed the war in Iraq were more likely concluding that they were right to have avoided a similarly close association with President Bush. 
  At home, Mr. Blair won a near-unanimous display of cross-party support in Parliament, which accompanied universal praise for the rescue and security crews who had assisted the wounded. But the bombings nonetheless raised the specter of Iraq, which haunted Mr. Blair through his recent election campaign. 
  By Friday, critical voices on the left and the right assailed him for having drawn Britain into a war on terrorism -- ''whether we like it not,'' in the words of the historian and former newspaper editor Max Hastings, writing in the Conservative-leaning Daily Mail.
  The most serious hazard for Mr. Blair's political standing would, of course, be another such deadly attack.   ALAN COWELL
