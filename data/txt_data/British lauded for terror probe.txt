TO THE EDITOR:
The British use classic police investigative methods and stopped a serious terror threat. George Bush and company use military methods and create a breeding ground for terrorists.
It is very instructive that the motivation for the British-Pakistanis to take out airplanes is the abuse Iraqis are sustaining because of the U.S. invasion. I wish the next person claiming the occupation of Iraq is somehow protecting us from terrorism would explain the linkage between the two.
Comparing the results of the British technique and the U.S. "investigative" technique that managed to entrap a gang of bozo wackos in Miami shows the British get it and the United States does not.
The British managed to catch a group that appears to have been serious about taking out a number of planes, while the U.S. Justice Department had to get their informer to suggest a plot against a building the "terrorists" wouldn't be able to find in order to show the Bush administration's ability to "protect" us from terrorism.
In short, if you want to protect people from terrorists, go the British route. If you want showy public relations that appeal to people's visceral reactions, go the U.S. route. Both programs are goal-oriented, but it depends on your goals - protection of the public or public adulation.
