More than 200 high schools and colleges across the nation participated in YAF’s 9/11: Never Forget project to commemorate the lives murdered on September 11, 2001 by radical Islamic terrorists. Each school placed 2,977 American flags into the ground to remind their peers of the loss our nation suffered on that tragic day.
Without these brave student activists, many schools would ignore this anniversary or promote a politically correct version of what happened 18 years ago today.
Young America’s Foundation created the 9/11: Never Forget Project in 2003 to help students create meaningful memorials to the innocent victims of radical Islamic terrorism, and to inspire commitment to defending our freedoms whenever they are attacked. Since its inception, more than 11 million American flags have been placed in displays across the nation.
