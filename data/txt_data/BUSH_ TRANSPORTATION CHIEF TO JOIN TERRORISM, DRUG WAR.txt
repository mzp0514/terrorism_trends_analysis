WASHINGTON - President George Bush said Monday that he wanted Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner to play a major role in U.S. efforts to stop drug traffic and terrorism.  Bush noted that Skinner was a former U.S. attorney for northern Illinois.
He said he had asked Skinner to ''work closely'' with the administration's drug policy director, William J. Bennett, to help coordinate efforts to stop illegal drug shipments.  Bush made his comments as part of Skinner's swearing-in ceremony Monday as the nation's new transportation secretary. In that post, Skinner will have control over the U.S. Coast Guard and the Federal Aviation Administration, which are part of the department.  In Skinner's remarks, he told about 250 people - including Illinois Gov.  James R. Thompson and numerous Transportation Department officials - who attended the ceremony that, ''We must do everything we can to stop the flow of drugs into this country.'' Bush said he had asked Skinner to travel next week to an international aviation conference in Montreal to ''do all he can at that meeting to hasten the day when the international community puts an end to terrorism in the skies.'' ''I can't think of anyone I'd rather have in charge than Sam Skinner,'' Bush said.  Skinner, 50, is a lawyer who headed the Regional Transportation Authority of Northeastern Illinois from 1984 until this year. He also ran Bush's campaigns in Illinois in 1980 and 1988.
