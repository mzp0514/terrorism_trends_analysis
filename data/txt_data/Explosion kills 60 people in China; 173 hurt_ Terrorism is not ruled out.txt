BEIJING (AP) - Investigators believe a massive explosion on a truck near the capital of China's tense Muslim northwest that killed 60 people and injured 173 was likely an accident, but have not ruled out terrorism, an official said Saturday.
The truck, which was carrying explosives for disposal, detonated during Friday evening's rush hour on a major road in the western suburbs of Urumqi in Xinjiang province.
The blast thundered across the city and sent a thick cloud of black smoke shooting upward, residents said.
More than 200 police, soldiers and medical personnel sealed off the area, sifting through more than 20 scorched and damaged vehicles and buildings for survivors, said government officials and the state-run Xinhua News Agency.
Based on the initial evidence, police believe an accident caused the blast, although they have not excluded terrorism, said an official with the Xinjiang government's foreign propaganda office, who only gave his surname, Zhang.
But the explosion's timing and location - in the carefully guarded heart of a region with a history of separatist violence - has raised doubts about the government's version and fears it might be linked to Muslim separatists waging China's most violent internal rebellion.
"This accident is very strange," said Erkin Ekrem, leader of a group advocating separatism for Xinjiang's Uighurs, the region's largest Turkic Muslim ethnic group.
