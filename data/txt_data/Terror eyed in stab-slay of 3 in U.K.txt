British police ruled the fatal stabbing of three people in Reading a "terror incident," officials said Sunday.
According to local police, three other people were injured in the incident which came around 7 p.m. local time Saturday, about three hours after a Black Lives Matter protest ended at a park about 40 miles west of London.
The rally that preceded the stabbing is not suspected to be related to the attack.
A witness who was in the park said a "lone man" walked into Forbury Gardens Park, "suddenly shouted some unintelligible words and went around a large group of around 10, trying to stab them."
"He stabbed three of them severely in the neck and under the arms, and then turned and started running toward me, and we turned and started running," personal trainer Lawrence Wort said.
Police have not identified the 25-year-old man they said was arrested as the suspect, but sources told the Telegraph that he is Khairi Saadallah, a refugee from Libya. He had previously served time for "a relatively minor conviction," not terrorism, according to the BBC.
The Thames Valley Police were spotted outside a block of apartments where Saadallah allegedly lived.
"There is no intelligence to suggest that there is any further danger to the public," Detective Chief Superintendent Ian Hunter said.
Dean Haydon, the U.K.'s coordinator of counterterrorism policing, said Sunday that counterterror detectives were taking over the investigation.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted Saturday: "My thoughts are with all of those affected by the appalling incident in Reading and my thanks to the emergency services on the scene."
