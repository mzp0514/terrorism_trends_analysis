Mr. Koch said he was talking specifically about Lebanon, Syria and Iran.
Mayor Koch, specifically referring to Lebanon, Syria and Iran, says that despite danger to seven hostages still held or missing in Lebanon, US 'must take diplomatic, economic and military action against those countries which support terrorism within their borders' (S)''I believe we should recall every American citizen from those three countries,'' the Mayor said in a speech before the National Press Club. Mr. Koch was in Washington for a party featuring cast members of ''Mayor,'' the musical based on his book.
He recommended that the United States ''destroy'' the city of Baalbek in Lebanon and Kharg Island in Iran. He also said that ''unless better targets come up,'' the United States should use its military ''to make it impossible'' for Beirut International Airport to be used. To reduce civilian casualties, he said, the United States should give advance notice to its targets.
Mr. Koch has urged military punishment for terrorists since Lebanese Shiites hijacked the Trans World Airlines jet 18 days ago.
