WASHINGTON -- A Saudi man has agreed to be deported from Canada to the United States to tell what he knows about a bombing that killed 19 American airmen in Saudi Arabia last year, his lawyers and sources said today.
Hani Abdel Rahim Hussein Al-Sayegh -- who could face execution if returned to his homeland and convicted of terrorism -- also has agreed to plead guilty to separate conspiracy charges in a deal with the Justice Department, said a U.S. law enforcement source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
His deportation is considered critical because he could provide U.S. authorities their first confirmation of Saudi government claims that Iran was involved in the Khobar Towers housing complex bombing in June 1996 in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.
Al-Sayegh will not be charged in the Khobar Towers attack that killed the U.S. airmen and injured hundreds of others but will reveal what he knows about the bombing, a source said. He could be transferred to the United States as early as Wednesday, the source said.
Canadian authorities alleged that al-Sayegh drove a car that signaled the truck carrying the bomb when to pull up beside the apartment complex.
Michael Wildes, Al-Sayegh's lawyer, said his client will be deported to protect him and help the United States.
"I believe the arrangement serves both the interests of my client's safety and the U.S. government's interest in investigating the Khobar Towers bombing," said Wildes.
Individuals connected with terrorism in Saudi Arabia are usually tortured or killed.
