An Egyptian military court, ringed by sharpshooters and armed police, sentenced to death on Thursday eight militants convicted of plotting to overthrow the government.  Thirty-one other militants were jailed, several for life, court officials said.
The trials were the first major hearings under a tough anti-terrorism law passed in July by President Hosni Mubarak to try to counter a surge in militant violence. Seventy people, one a British tourist, have been killed in the violence during the past year.  The eight sentenced to death, seven in absentia, were among 26 members of the Jihad group that was behind the assassination of President Anwar Sadat at a military parade in 1981.  Jihad emerged in the 1970s as one of the main militant groups willing to use force to topple the government and establish a strict Islamic state, but it was largely crushed after Sadat's assassination.  The court, sitting in Alexandria, acquitted three Jihad members and jailed 15 for between five years and life.  One of the eight sentenced to death in absentia was Mohamed Shawki Islambuli, said by lawyers to be the brains behind the group. He is a brother of Khaled Islambuli, the head of the assassins who killed Sadat.  The court did not set a date for the execution.
