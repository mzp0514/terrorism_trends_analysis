The lower federal courts conduct business in about 600 buildings nationwide. There are 94 district courts, with 592 active judges, and 13 circuit courts, with 147 active judges.
The circuit courts have central offices, but in most cases the judges maintain chambers scattered around each multistate judicial circuit. Circuit courts usually sit as three-judge panels.
 A recent Congressional Research Service report refers to a section of the U.S. Code that provides "in locales of the United States where federal courts could not function due to an emergency, the president might temporarily declare martial law and vest trial court authority in military tribunals convened by commanding officers in the field dispatched to enforce federal law."
 But federal judges say the main terrorism fear facing them is a long-standing one: that a court could be targeted as a consequence of holding a trial of terrorists.
 "Acts against us are likely to be acts of retaliation in connection with a particularly high-profile case," a lower-court judge said. "An attack on the Supreme Court would be someone trying to make an institutional statement."
 Several judges are under round-the-clock protection by U.S. marshals because of various threats, according to Richard Carelli, a spokesman for the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.
 The Judicial Conference is pressing a request for an immediate infusion of $240 million to blast-proof the windows at courthouses nationwide. But the White House has said the money is not available.
