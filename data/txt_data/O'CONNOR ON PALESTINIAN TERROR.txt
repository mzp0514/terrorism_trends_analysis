John Cardinal O'Connor, the Archbishop of New York, said today that the plight of the Palestinian people, if left unresolved, ''has to spawn terrorism.''
At a news conference after a meeting with Pope John Paul II, Cardinal O'Connor sought to make clear that his support for ''a Palestinian homeland'' did not in any way imply a criticism of Israel, or a political proposal.
But he used strong language to press his case for a solution to the Palestinian refugee problem. He also conditioned his support for formal diplomatic recognition of Israel by the Vatican on a solution to the Palestinian problem and safety guarantees for Christians living in the Middle East.
Asked about his comments on a Palestinian homeland in an interview on Wednesday, Cardinal O'Connor said every new generation of Palestinians ''is being reared in a situation that I would think would have to spawn a great deal of bitterness and hatred.''
''The Palestinians need some security, some roots,'' he said. ''If the situation continues, it would seem to me that it has to spawn terrorism.''
Cardinal O'Connor's statements on the Palestinian problem had created ''concern'' among some Jewish leaders, Rabbi Marc Tanenbaum, the director of international relations for the American Jewish Committee, said today.
''There is a danger,'' Rabbi Tanenbaum said in a telephone interview from New York, ''that they will be misunderstood as an unfriendly statement toward Israel and the Jewish people.''
''It is important to record that Cardnal O'Connor is a devoted friend of the Jewish people and is deeply committed to the security and well-being of the people and of the State of Israel,'' he said.
