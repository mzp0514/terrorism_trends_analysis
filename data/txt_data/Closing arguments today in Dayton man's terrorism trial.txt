DAYTON â€”
Federal prosecutors and defense attorneys will have one more chance to argue about the guilt or innocence of Laith Alebbini, who is standing trial on charges that he tried to travel overseas to join ISIS.
 Closing arguments in the bench trial before U.S. District Court Judge Walter Rice are scheduled for this morning in Dayton's District Court.
 The first terrorism trial in the Southern District of Ohio will conclude after prosecutors give their closing, defense attorneys give theirs and prosecutors finish with their rebuttal.
 The defense rested Tuesday without calling a witness.
 Prosecutors rested on Monday after eight days of testimony related to Alebbini, 28, who is on trial for conspiracy and attempting "to provide material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organization in the form of personnel to work under ISIS's direction and control."
 Prosecutors questioned 12 witnesses, including a local confidential FBI source and Alebbini's childhood friend, who prosecutors said tried to talk Alebbini out of any terrorism plans. Alebbini moved to the Dayton area in early 2017.
 Numerous exhibits were read, played or entered into the record during the prosecution's case. Court records do not indicate any timeline for Rice to announce a verdict. Alebbini waived his right to a jury trial.
 In April 2017, Alebbini allegedly tried to travel overseas from Cincinnati's airport in an effort to join ISIS and fight in Syria. He was arrested and has been detained ever since.
