Serious career consequences for four of its own officials following release of the State Department Accountability Review Board's report on the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi are fitting, but more is needed to assuage well-founded concerns about that fatal fiasco and its aftermath. 
The report's unclassified public version blames "systematic failures and leadership and management deficiencies" at State for the deaths of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans at the compound in Libya. 
It says the Benghazi security plan, "inadequate" for months prior, was "grossly inadequate" to repel the attack, despite "repeated requests" for more security staff. Appropriately, Eric Boswell, assistant secretary of diplomatic security, has resigned, and his deputy, Charlene Lamb, is among three officials placed on administrative leave. 
The report also says "there was no protest" before the attack, contradicting initial administration spin about reaction to an anti-Muslim, U.S.-made video. But that's a long way from fully explaining why the Obama administration took so long to get its Benghazi story straight , and from accountability for what looks like an attempted cover-up of a botched response to terrorism. 
The Obama White House not only must tell the whole Benghazi truth; it must impose consequences on all who are culpable , and ensure that more Americans do not suffer the fate of Mr. Stevens and his colleagues.
