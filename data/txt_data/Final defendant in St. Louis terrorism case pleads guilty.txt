ST. LOUIS - A New York man pleaded guilty in federal court here this week to supplying money and equipment to a former St. Louis County man who fought and died in Syria for the Islamic State, prosecutors said.
Nihad Rosic, 31, of Utica, also tried to travel to Syria himself, officials said. Rosic pleaded guilty Tuesday in U.S. District Court to one count of conspiring to provide material support to terrorists and one count of providing material support to terrorists.
He admitted helping Ramiz Hodzic, of St. Louis County, send money and supplies to Abdullah Ramo Pazara, who lived in St. Louis County until he left for Syria in 2013.
Prosecutors have said that Pazara rose to become an Islamic State commander and boasted of murder, beheadings and supporting slavery. He later died fighting for the group.
Richard Quinn, head of the St. Louis office of the FBI, said the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force stopped Rosic from making the trip to Syria twice, adding in a statement that Rosic "will now be held accountable for providing assistance to terrorists."
Rosic is scheduled to be sentenced in April. Last month Hodzic was sentenced to eight years in prison.
All of the original defendants in the case have pleaded guilty. Armin Harcevic, then 41, was sentenced in August to five and a half years. Jasminka Ramic, who pleaded guilty in 2015 to a lesser conspiracy charge, was sentenced to three years in prison and has already been released. Mediha Medy Salkicevic, of Schiller Park, Illinois, was sentenced in June to six and a half years.
