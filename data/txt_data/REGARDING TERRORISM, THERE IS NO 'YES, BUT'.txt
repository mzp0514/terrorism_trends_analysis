Editor, Times-Dispatch:
The article by Alberta Lindsey, "Cleric Says U.S Aid to Israel Stirs Terrorism," invites comment.
In the aftermath of the attacks on our country on September 11, we have been asked by our President and almost every other political and religious leader in our country not to stereotype or condemn followers of Islam because of what has been done to our country in the name of Islam.
This is the only fair and right thing to do. One of the founding principles of this great nation is the right to worship whom and how you please as long as it does not interfere with the rights of others to do the same. How many countries where Islam is the predominant religion can make the same claim? Saudi Arabia, Iran, Afghanistan? I think not.
Imam Shaheed Coovadia is another Islamic religious leader, in and outside our country, who condemns the acts of the terrorists, and in the same breath voices the "but" that it is our fault for supporting Israel. Such statements implicitly justify and condone the attacks on our country. Where are the unconditional condemnations from the political and religious leaders in the Arab and Islamic world? Where is the condemnation of the acts without the "but"?
We must realize this is war. The terrorists and the countries that openly and covertly support them never will be satisfied with anything but the complete and total destruction of Israel and the downfall of the United States of America. Make no mistake about that.
Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and others profess to be our friends, but what they do speaks so loudly I cannot hear what they say.
