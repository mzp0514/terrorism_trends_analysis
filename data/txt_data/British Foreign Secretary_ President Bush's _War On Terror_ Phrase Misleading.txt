(RTTNews) - British Foreign Secretary David Miliband on Thursday described U.S. President George Bush&apos;s &apos;War on Terror&apos; phrase as "misleading and mistaken," saying that it paved the way for various terror organizations to unite against the western nations.
"Ultimately, the notion is misleading and mistaken," Miliband said. "Historians will judge whether it has done more harm than good."
He said that the War on Terror phrase gave a false notion "of a unified, transnational enemy, embodied in the figure of Osama Bin Laden and the organization of al-Qaeda".
"The more we lump terrorist groups together, the more we play into the hands of those seeking to unify groups with little in common," he added.
He described terrorism as a "deadly tactic, not an institution or an ideology," adding that the "forces of violent extremism remain diverse."
"Democracies must respond to terrorism by championing the rule of law, not subordinating it," he said. "If we want to promote the politics of consent instead of terror and of democratic opportunity rather than fear and oppression, we must uphold our commitments to human rights and civil liberties both at home and abroad."
Miliband made the remarks while addressing a gathering at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel in Mumbai, one of two luxury hotels targeted in the November terrorist attacks that killed more than 180 people.
