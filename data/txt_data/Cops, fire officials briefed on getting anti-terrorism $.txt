Federal money is available to help local police and fire officials deal with terrorism, but they have to tell their representatives in Washington exactly what they want, says U.S. Rep. Curt Weldon.
At a seminar on counter-terrorism yesterday hosted by the Philadelphia Police Department, Weldon, a Delaware County Republican, urged local law-enforcement officials to tell Washington what their needs are - not the other way around.
About 150 people from local police departments and other agencies attended the seminar, and heard experts offer advice on how to prevent and deal with terrorism.
Among those who spoke were James Kallstrom, a former top official in the FBI's New York office, and John Whiteside, a retired FBI specialist in foreign counterintelligence.
Most of the seminar was closed to the public. However, reporters were invited to hear a speech by Weldon, a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee.
To dramatize the danger of portable nuclear weapons, Weldon displayed a normal-looking briefcase containing a mock nuclear device. Weldon said he had it designed by a CIA expert, based on specifications from a U.S. Department of Energy Web site.
Weldon said that of the 132 nuclear suitcase bombs built by the Soviet Union, more than 80 were unaccounted for.
