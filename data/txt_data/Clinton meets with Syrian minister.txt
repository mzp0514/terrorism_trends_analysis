Compromise:The president wants to restart Middle East peace talks
WASHINGTON (AP) - In an unusual White House meeting, President Clinton made a personal pitch to the Syrian foreign minister on Wednesday to restart stalled talks with Israel in hopes of forging a comprehensive Middle East peace.
The hour-long discussion between Clinton and Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa was inconclusive, U.S. officials said.
Clinton - who normally meets with the heads of foreign governments on matters of such magnitude - spoke with al-Sharaa about "how to get the Israelis and the Syrians to resolve the outstanding issues and achieve a lasting, permanent peace agreement between them," said Mike Hammer, a White House spokesman.
"This is part of the ongoing process," Hammer said. "We are in contact with both Israel and the Syrians, and this was part of our effort to try to get both parties to come to the table and discuss the situation directly."
Al-Sharaa did not talk to reporters after the White House meeting, which was not announced in advance. He then went to New York to talk with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright for the second time in a week.
The United States still regards Syria as a sponsor of terrorism, although Syria's last known export of terrorism was in 1986.
