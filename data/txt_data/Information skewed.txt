Regarding the article, "U.S. attacks rebels in 2 Iraq cities/ Maine soldier dies in combat near Baghdad" (BDN, April 28).
"Rebels"? If we in America were combating foreign invaders, we would be called "patriots."
Such skewing of information is what makes some people liken this conflict to the Vietnam War, which is seen very differently than it was at the time. Certainly the same will prove true of this conflict. I'm doing my best to see beyond the media portrayal and political jargon to decipher what's really going on.
History tells us that when foreigners step in to try to bring about "good" change, often the opposite happens. How many despots, including Saddam Hussein, have gained positions of power as a result of foreign intervention?
President Bush's re-election ads call the war in Iraq "a war on terrorism." The Iraq conflict has nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism. Bush is a good person trying to make the world a better place, but I'm very unsettled that soldiers are dying and their families suffering without justification. Time has shown that concern about the weapons of mass destruction is unfounded. Saddam is in custody. The terrorism issue lies elsewhere.
