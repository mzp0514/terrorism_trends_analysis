A group working to dedicate a monument to honor veterans of the war on terrorism 20 years after the 9/11 attacks will hold an informational program in Tarentum. 
The Westmoreland County Veterans of the War on Terror will hold the free event at the Alle-Kiski Valley Heritage Museum at 3 p.m. Sept. 22. 
The program will focus on the group's efforts to establish the monument. Several supporters and veterans will talk about the monument's purpose, location, site concept, fundraising efforts, design and volunteer opportunities. They also will accept donations. 
The group said more than 5,000 Westmoreland County residents have served in the war on terrorism, and 14 have been killed in action in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
The monument is expected to cost about $350,000. The group anticipates that most of the cost will be covered by grants and corporate sponsors. 
The group wants to place the monument at Twin Lakes Park in Hempfield, and dedicate it on Sept. 11, 2021. In March, the group placed a "future home" sign at the location at Georges Station Road and Streetpark Loop at the entrance to Peach Plaza. 
The group is pursuing nonprofit status. In the meantime, Westmoreland Human Services is acting as its nonprofit fiscal sponsor.
