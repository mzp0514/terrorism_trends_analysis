-
THE explosion of TWA Flight 800 and the bombing of Centennial Olympic
Park in Atlanta were monstrous affronts - the work of despicable men.
The nation still grieves for the lives lost and the people injured.
Unfortunately, President Clinton seized the moment to grab more power
for the federal government in the name of fighting terrorism.
Old bills already rejected by Congress were dusted off and repackaged
as an "anti-terrorism law."
Clinton's bill would make it easier for federal officials to trace
telephone calls. Computer messages would be decoded by the federal
government. Taggants would be added to a whole bunch of common
chemicals.
Let's not throw the Bill of Rights out the window in our attempt to
deal with terrorism.
We still don't know what happened on TWA Flight 800. As for the
Olympic explosion, how would tracing phone calls and overseas spying
stop a local person from making a homemade pipe bomb?
The Clinton White House got its hands on the not-so-confidential FBI
files of 900 Republicans. This is being blamed on a political dirty
trickster that no one at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. now admits hiring.
Congress should politely decline the president's request to tread on
more liberties in the name of security.
Oh, be impolite. The proposal goes too far.
