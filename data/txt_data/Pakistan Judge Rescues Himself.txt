(RTTNews) - The trial of seven Pakistani suspects linked to last November&apos;s terror attacks in Mumbai suffered a set-back when the judge hearing the case sought to recuse himself, citing "unavoidable reasons."
Judge Baqir Ali Rana of the anti-terrorism court, who has been conducting the trial of the suspects, including key Lashker-e-Toiba (LeT) operatives Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi and Zarar Shah, within the high-security Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, sent a formal request Wednesday to the Chief Justice of Lahore High Court seeking transfer of the case to some other judge.
Some reports say Rana cited "security issues" as the reason for his request.
The development came amid reports that the judge had received death threats from the LeT--the Islamist terror group behind the Mumbai attacks in which 183 persons, including many Americans, were killed and over 283 others injured.
Adding to Justice Rana&apos;s discomfort, defense lawyers charged him with being biased against the accused after they (the accused) were indicted in the absence of their lawyers during a hearing October 10.
The seven suspects--Lakhvi, Shah, Abu al-Qama, Hamad Amin Sadiq, Shahid Jamil Riaz, Jamil Ahmed and Younas Anjum--have been charged under the Anti-Terrorism Act for providing training, financial support, accommodation, equipment and communications gear to the ten Pakistani terrorists who attacked Mumbai on November 26 last year.
The next hearing, scheduled for October 24, remains uncertain.
