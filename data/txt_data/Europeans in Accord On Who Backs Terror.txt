The Interior Ministers of the European Community, except Greece, agreed here today on which countries backed terrorism. But, for security reasons, they did not make public the list.
The British Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd, said the accord would help the police fight terrorism and governments to react politically.
''If this document is to be effective, its details have to remain secret,'' Mr. Hurd said at a news conference. ''We have moved from the exchange of raw intelligence about people and organizations to an agreed analysis of the threat.''
He declined to say why Greece had refused to go along, but said: ''I believe the Greeks are fully conscious of the need to counter terrorism. They simply had reservations about the possible political implications of the analysis.''
Greece has refused to go along with sanctions imposed against Syria that followed an attempt to blow up an El Al jetliner in London on April 17. Greece said at the time that it was not convinced that Syria was involved.
Although the Interior Ministers had said that they were considering a tightening of passport and visa requirements as a way to fight terrorism, Mr. Hurd said the issue was not discussed.
He said the problem was ''how do you reconcile the desire of Europeans for freer movement inside the Community with effective external controls in the Community against drug traffickers, fraudsters, terrorists and the rest.''
