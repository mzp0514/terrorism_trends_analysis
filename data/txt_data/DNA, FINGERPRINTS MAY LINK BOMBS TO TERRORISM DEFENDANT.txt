SEATTLE (AP) -- An Algerian man accused of plotting terrorist bombings in the United States can be linked to explosives found in his car by DNA evidence and fingerprints, government lawyers say.
According to documents filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court, counterterrorism experts are prepared to testify that Ahmed Ressam was part of a radical Islamic group.
The documents were filed in response to motions by Ressam's lawyers that challenged the admissibility of fingerprint evidence and asked Judge John C. Coughenour to dismiss the lone count of terrorism conspiracy.
Ressam, 32, was arrested Dec. 14 at Port Angeles, by U.S. Customs inspectors who said they found explosives and bomb-making equipment in the trunk of his rental car.
Government lawyers have accused him and other Algerian nationals of planning to commit terrorist acts during New Year's Eve millennial celebrations.
His trial is scheduled to begin March 12 in Los Angeles.
In the latest court documents, assistant U.S. attorney Jerry Diskin wrote that some experts will testify that evidence shows Ressam handled explosives and built a timing device for a bomb, while another will describe him as a member of a cell of the "criminal Radical Islamic Fundamentalist Movement," which views America as enemies of Islam.
