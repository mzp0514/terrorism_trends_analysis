NEW YORK (AP) - The largest terrorism trial in U.S. history
starts in earnest this week with opening statements and a warning
from the judge that religion is not on trial.
Prosecutors will try to show that Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman and 11
other Muslims planned a "war of urban terrorism" in America that
could have killed thousands of people.
Prosecutors will argue they plotted to blow up the World Trade
Center, the United Nations, the FBI's New York headquarters, two
tunnels and a bridge, and to kill Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and other politicians and judges.
After 13 lawyers deliver their opening statements beginning
today, U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey will instruct the jury on
seditious conspiracy, the rarely used Civil War-era charge used in
the case. The trial's magnitude can be measured both by the number
of defendants and the scope of what they allegedly plotted as well as
the damage already wrought.
Mukasey told lawyers last week he would tell the jury the
defendants are not accused of trying to overthrow the U.S.
government, only of trying to wage a war against it. He also will
advise them that if someone breaks laws, "the fact that it is
undertaken in the name of religion is no defense whatsoever."
"There is no religion on trial here," the judge said in a
preliminary draft of his jury instructions.
Lawyers for Abdel-Rahman, the 56-year-old blind cleric alleged
to have headed the conspiracy, charge that he's being prosecuted for
his beliefs. If convicted, he could face life in prison.
