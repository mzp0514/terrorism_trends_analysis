After 30 bombings of abortion clinics, including six in the Washington area, President Reagan has finally spoken out in denunciation, but he chose his words carefully. He condemned the bombers' ''violent, anarchist activities,'' thereby distinguishing himself from the National Organization for Women, which has called the bombings a ''campaign of terrorism and intimidation'' against women seeking to exercise a constitutional right.
Topics editorial welcomes Pres Reagan's denunciation, however carefully worded, of recent bombings of abortion clinics; questions his refusal to acknowledge that these are acts of terrorism which warrant action by Federal Bureau of InvestigationWhatever the President's choice of words, the condemnation is welcome. But does the distinction between anarchy and terrorism make a difference?
Yes, in one practical sense. By recognizing the bombings as acts of terrorism, Mr. Reagan might have seemed to overrule William Webster, Director of the F.B.I., who has declined to take the lead investigative role. The bombings don't qualify as terrorism directed against the Government, he said, so they fall more appropriately within the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.  But there's another difference. Anarchy implies violent opposition to authority for the simple reason that it is authority. Terrorism implies violent promotion of intolerant, intolerable zeal. An Administration proud of its opposition to abortion bears a special obligation to condemn and pursue all who destroy in the name of life. Whether or not you call the bombers terrorists, their method is plain enough: terror.
