This is in response to Harold Lessure's "Israel Has No Choice" letter (Feb. 17). I think Mr. Lessure needs a lesson in both history and current events.
But let's focus on current events for now.
 He is absolutely right about targeting civilians; there is no justification for doing that. If Mr. Lessure looks at the statistics he will see that many more Palestinian civilians than Israelis have been killed in this second Intifada, not to mention the tens of thousands who were made homeless, jobless and hopeless.
 Does he not consider that to be terrorism? Does the fact that it's done by a uniformed army make it OK? Make no mistake, the root of all this violence is the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It is the illegal settlements being built and expanded every day on land stolen from its rightful owners (the Palestinians). It is this ruthless occupation with all the misery it brings that is the cause of this vicious circle of violence.
 This occupation, Mr. Lessure, is targeting innocent civilians and is terrorism. Israel does have a choice but chooses not to exercise it. The Palestinians have no choice but to defend themselves and stand their ground. Let us cast away this double standard and face the truth. Ignoring the truth and hiding it will not bring peace. Truth and justice will.
