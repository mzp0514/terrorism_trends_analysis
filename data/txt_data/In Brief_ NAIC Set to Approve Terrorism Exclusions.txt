The National Association of Insurance Commissioners is poised to approve exclusions for terrorism on commercial insurance policies if Congress does not create a federal backstop by yearend, Iowa Insurance Commissioner Terri Vaughan told reporters Monday.
"If the Congress adjourns without enacting a backstop, you will see exclusions being approved," Ms. Vaughan said following an NAIC membership meeting.
"We are currently working on the scope of the exclusions."
Separately on Monday, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle said the Senate would not take it up until Thursday at the earliest, thus dashing the hopes of industry officials who had predicted the Senate would begin debating the bill as early as today.
Ms. Vaughan said if a bill is not enacted this year, insurance companies have three options: elect not to write policies, write policies with state-approved exclusions, or write policies through offshore affiliates with policies that do not need to be approved by state regulators.
She reiterated her concerns in a letter sent to Senate leaders on Friday. "Many insurers have asked state regulators to grant terrorism exclusions against future losses. Some carriers are indicating that beginning Jan. 1 they will not renew workers' compensation coverage.
