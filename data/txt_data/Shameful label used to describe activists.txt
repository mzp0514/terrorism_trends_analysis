TO THE EDITOR:
What a shameful brush David Martosko used, painting animal activists as "terrorists" ("Don't let the name fool you," Intell, Sept. 1). It is an incredible insult to the victims of real terrorism to apply this label to animal and environmental activists, even those who go beyond picketing and boycotts.
In a day and age when terrorism means daily bombings all over the world and hijacking planes and flying them into buildings, it is beneath contempt to apply the same term to people who simply work to expose the activities of companies who are cruel to animals.
Whether you think factory farming is cruel or not, you should care that Martosko and his organization, Center for Consumer Freedom, are working to make it a crime to protest anything having to do with the environment, product safety, consumer health, wildlife or domestic animals.
Intell readers should know CCF is funded exclusively by the fast-food, meat and tobacco lobbies and has fewer than 1,000 individual members - which means they have very little incentive to truly represent real consumers.
Other groups the CCF finds unacceptable? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mothers Against Drunk Driving and the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine.
Even if animal issues don't concern you, how about clean air? Clean water? Safe and healthy food? Better clam up, or the CCF, which heeds only to huge corporations, will be after you next.
