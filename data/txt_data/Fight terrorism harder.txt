Somehow our "war on terrorism" seems to have lost its way in murky waters. I thought that we were asking countries and governments to choose peace or terrorism.
I thought that they couldn't have it both ways. I guess I didn't listen very carefully. But I do know that our efforts to "protect" Americans from terrorism are woefully misguided and sometimes downright silly. Our political leaders do not seem to have the will to do what is truly necessary to keep terrorists out. They could learn from Winston Churchill.
In the following quotation from Churchill, substitute the word "American" for "British" and "radical Muslim" for "Nazi."
"You have to consider the character of the Nazi movement and the rule which it implies. . . . There can never be friendship between the British democracy and the Nazi power, that power which spurns Christian ethics, which cheers its onward course by a barbarous paganism, which vaunts the spirit of aggression and conquest, which derives strength and perverted pleasure from persecution, and uses, as we have seen, with pitiless brutality, the threat of murderous force. That power cannot ever be the trusted friend of the British democracy."
Our government must stop issuing visas of any kind to Middle Eastern men between the ages of 16 and 45. Before any more such visas are issued, we must locate, identify and interview every male Middle Eastern alien already in our country on a visa and verify just what that person is doing here and substantiate his departure at the expiration of his visa. When we do less, the public cannot take seriously the rhetoric of politicians that we are truly engaged in a "war on terrorism."
