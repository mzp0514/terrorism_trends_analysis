OKLAHOMA CITY (AP)-The baby whose picture became a symbol of the horrific bomb attack was a girl who had just celebrated her first birthday.
Until late Thursday, Baylee Almon's name, age and even sex was unknown.
Her mother wept as she told a TV interviewer that she had decided to come forward to show the world how deeply she had suffered.
"If they do catch these criminals, maybe they'll see this and see how much they've hurt me, and hurt my family and hurt other people," Aren Almon said.
The picture of a limp, bloody Baylee in a firefighter's arms brought home the horror of the bombing and hopes of rescue.
Baylee was in the day-care center at the federal building when the bomb went off Wednesday, killing at least 11 other children.
She was pronounced dead at the scene by emergency medical technicians, said firefighter Chris Fields, whose attempt to rescue Baylee was captured by an amateur photographer.
Bank clerk Charles H. Porter IV came upon police Sgt. John Avera carrying Baylee from the smoking ruins of the federal building. As Avera handed the baby to Fields, Porter snapped away. His photos, transmitted worldwide, prompted a flood of calls to newspapers from people concerned about the fate of the child.
