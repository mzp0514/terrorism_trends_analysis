The Supreme Court agreed Wednesday to let the armed forces transfer terrorism suspect Jose Padilla to civilian control so he can face criminal charges.
The decision is at least a temporary victory for President George W. Bush's administration.
The justices overruled a lower court, which had attempted to block the transfer as part of a rebuke to the White House.
The Supreme Court said it would decide later whether to review Padilla's challenge to his military detention.
Padilla was arrested in 2002 in Chicago and put into military custody, where he was held as an enemy combatant -- without either charges or traditional legal rights. His status has been the subject of multiple court rulings and criticism by civil rights groups.
The Supreme Court had been asked to use Padilla's case to define the scope of a president's power over American citizens taken into custody on U.S. soil. The justices had been expected to hear his appeal. But before the Supreme Court could act, the government brought criminal charges against Padilla in Florida.
Those charges do not involve allegations that had been made by the administration since 2002 -- that Padilla was part of an al-Qaida-backed plot to blow up apartment buildings.
Last month, a panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., refused to allow the transfer of Padilla from military custody.
