The White House has proposed an overhaul of the nation's counter-terrorism strategy that would concentrate greater power in the National Security Council and shift key assignments among federal law enforcement agencies, The Washington Post reported today, citing administration officials. Under the proposal, the NSC would assign roles to the 18 federal departments or agencies --- including the FBI, CIA and Pentagon --- now involved in the counter-terrorism effort, and have authority over everything from the development of yearly budget plans to rescue efforts after a terrorist attack.
Attorney General Janet Reno supports the idea of greater coordination but is concerned that decisions normally left to professional prosecutors might be put in the hands of NSC staff members without law enforcement experience, the Post said. Fla. executes 2nd killer in 2 days
Leo Jones, who had challenged the constitutionality of Florida's use of an electric chair, died there early today for the murder of a police officer. Jones' attorneys objected after the fiery death of another inmate in March 1997, the second time flames had erupted during use of the chair. His was the second execution since Florida resumed electrocutions Monday.
