THE ACCUSED masterminds of a multimillion-dollar cigarette smuggling ring arrived in New York on Wednesday to face charges as police probe whether they're funding terrorism.
Basel and Samir Ramadan were arrested last week in Maryland in a takedown by state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and the NYPD.
Investigators said the ring cleared $22 million in profits in the last 17 months, but so far they've been able to account for only $7.8 million of that money. The probe is now focused on whether some of the profits wound up overseas.
Sixteen people were charged with enterprise corruption - not terrorism - but one of those arrested has ties to a top leader of Hamas, while a second had financial ties to the blind sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, convicted in a foiled 1993 plot to blow up New York City landmarks, police said.
The NYPD identified another defendant as a "confidant" of Rashid Baz, a Middle Eastern man convicted of shooting at a van full of Yeshiva students on the Brooklyn Bridge in 1994, killing 16-year-old Ari Halberstam.
When accused ringleader Basel Ramadan, 42, was arrested at his home in Maryland last week, authorities say they found three unlicensed handguns and $1 million in cash.
The brothers were taken Wednesday to the 72nd Precinct in Brooklyn and were scheduled to be arraigned Thursday in Brooklyn Supreme Court.
