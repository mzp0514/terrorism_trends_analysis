TO THE EDITOR:
Yes, it's about oil! "But it is also about confronting terrorism." There is evil in this world, and this evil called Saddam Hussein has a vengeance for America!

Saddam is known as the Butcher of Baghdad because of his personal involvement in torture and murder.
Since his defeat by American and allied forces during the Gulf War in 1991, Saddam's main goals are to get revenge on America and eliminate U.N. economic sanctions! He swore personal revenge upon President George H.W. Bush. After the Gulf War, Iraqi terrorists came close to assassinating Bush with a car bomb when he visited Kuwait.
In 1993, when the first World Trade Center bombing took place, the Islamic terrorist Ramzi Yousef used an Iraqi passport to enter America, his accomplice who made the huge bomb escaped to Iraq and allegedly lives there.
Remember the two U.S. Embassy bombings in 1998, one in Kenya and one in Tanzania, and the October 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen.
There is no doubt that Iraq has been using bin Laden's terrorists to attack America.
One reason why a lot of intelligence is not released is because of fear and panic it would cause.
There is no smoking gun. Just add up the facts!
