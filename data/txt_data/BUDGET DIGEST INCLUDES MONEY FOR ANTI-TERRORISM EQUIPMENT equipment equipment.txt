The Legislature has given the state Fire Commission $ 250,000 to buy
anti-terrorism equipment.
The money, for a program to be jointly operated with State Police,
will buy bomb suits, X-ray equipment, a vehicle to transport bombs or
suspected bomb packages, photographic equipment and a robot that can
enter potentially dangerous areas, said Fire Marshal Walter Smittle.  smittle.  smittle.
Also, fire officials and State Police will add three bomb specialists
to the three already at work, Smittle said.
The money was put in the Budget Digest approved Sunday by Del. Barbara
Warner, D-Harrison, a member of the budget conference committee.
The committee uses the digest to tell state agencies how to spend
their money. Agencies do not have to follow the recommendations, but
risk future funding if they do not.
"With the way the world is, even the way West Virginia is right now
with the militia problem, I think it's much needed," Warner said.
Mountaineer Militia leader Floyd "Ray" Looker and six others are
accused of plotting to blow up the FBI fingerprint center in
Clarksburg.
State Police have collected and disposed of explosives for years but
need more sophisticated equipment, Smittle said.
Bombings and bomb threats are rare in West Virginia, but police need
to be prepared, said Maj. Chuck Starcher of the State Police.  police.  police.
