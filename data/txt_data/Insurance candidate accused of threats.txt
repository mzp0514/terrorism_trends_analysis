Republican Tim Ireland, waging an uphill campaign for state insurance  commissioner against former congressman Bill Nelson, says his Democratic  opponent is trying to intimidate contributors.
Ireland, a former state representative from Fort Myers, said insurance  agents and company officials have told him Nelson has threatened them if they  support Ireland in the Cabinet race.

"I'm hearing it everywhere I go. I think it's extremely disturbing,"  Ireland said last week. "This kind of political terrorism has no place in  Florida politics."
Nelson's campaign manager, Brian May, denied the candidate threatened  anyone and said Ireland is trying to pump up a campaign that trails in money  and name recognition. Nelson had raised more than five times as much money as  Ireland through early October.
But some insurance industry officials said Nelson has told them he didn't  like them contributing to both candidates.
A publication for insurance agents said in its October issue that Nelson  was trying to block Ireland's fund-raising within the industry.
"Potential Ireland contributors are being told that an Ireland  contribution is a vote against the Nelson campaign," said the magazine for  Specialty Agents Inc. "Nelson has warned industry contributors that he "will  remember' those who worked against him."
May said contributors "ought to make a decision" about who they support  instead of giving money to both candidates but denied Nelson made any threats.
Florida's insurance commissioner also serves as state treasurer and fire  marshal and sits on the Cabinet.
