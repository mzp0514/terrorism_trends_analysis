The war in Iraq has become a homing beacon for Islamic militancy, threatening to destabilize neighboring countries and embolden terrorists to attack elsewhere, a senior RAND Corp. analyst told business and political elites at the World Economic Forum on Saturday.
"In terms of perception, we've already lost the war," said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism analyst who heads the Washington office of RAND Corp., a think tank known for its problem-solving research.
"I believe that a cult of the insurgency has emerged from Iraq."
Hoffman did not say whether he thought the 2003 invasion was justified, but did criticize the Bush administration for failing to consider its consequences.
"Our failure there was to not anticipate the repercussions and the blowback that Iraq could bring, and the fact that Iraq would become a clarion call for the Islamist cause," Hoffman said.
He said the success of the insurgency has shown potential terrorists everywhere how best to defeat a superpower. That, he added, will come back to haunt the West.
"The insurgents have been able to inflict a degree of pain on the United States military, the most vaunted military in the world, that Saddam Hussein's conventional forces couldn't have achieved," Hoffman said. "The foreign jihadists who have come to Iraq, when this ends, are going to go back to their own countries, particularly Saudi Arabia, but also Europe â€¦ These people are going to have been trained in urban terrorism."
