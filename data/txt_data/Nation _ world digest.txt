Eighth suspect named in N.C. terrorism case
A 20-year-old U.S. citizen who traveled to Pakistan in 2008 "to engage in violent jihad" has been named as the eighth suspect in a North Carolina terrorism case, according to court documents released Monday.
Jude Kenan Mohammad is charged with conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and conspiracy to murder, kidnap, maim and injure persons in a foreign country, according to a newly unsealed indictment. Authorities have said Mohammad is not in custody and is believed to be in Pakistan.
Seven other men were arrested last week and are scheduled to appear today in federal court for a detention hearing. The indictment alleges that Daniel Boyd, 39, bought guns and led the group of men - all but one of them U.S. citizens - who were planning to kidnap, kill and maim people in other countries.

The baby was found two days later at a New Hampshire homeless shelter with Haynes' former neighbor, Julie Corey. Corey has been charged with kidnapping and is being held in lieu of $2 million bail. The infant is now in state custody.

Stewart, 55, is serving 7 Â½ to 27 years. Neither was in the courtroom in Las Vegas on Monday while their attorneys argued neither had received a fair trial.
Michael Jackson's mother wins custody of kids - The wishes Michael Jackson expressed in his will began to come into reality Monday during a lengthy court hearing, with his mother placed firmly in charge of rearing his children and the two men he designated still at the reins of his financial empire.

Iraqi Shiite group vows to put down arms - Asaib Ahl al-Haq, or League of the Righteous, an extremist Shiite group believed responsible for the killing of five American soldiers in a bold raid south of Baghdad and the kidnapping of five British men has agreed to renounce violence, a government adviser said Monday.
