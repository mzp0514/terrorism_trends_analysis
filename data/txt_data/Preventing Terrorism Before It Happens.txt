To the Editor:
  Re ''Security Loses; Pork Wins'' (editorial, ''An Insecure Nation'' series, July 14):
The amendment passed by the Senate emphasizes, for the first time, preventing terrorist attacks and not just responding to them after they occur.
  The amendment offered by Senators Susan M. Collins and Joseph I. Lieberman forges a critical partnership between federal homeland security efforts and state, local and tribal police and other law enforcement officers. 
  Currently, prevention takes a back seat to responding to a terrorist attack. 
  The only source of homeland security money for law enforcement officers -- the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program -- is financed on an ad hoc basis and is not authorized in law. 
  The Collins-Lieberman legislation changes this to ensure that prevention efforts are adequately financed. 
  The amendment also ends wasteful and ineffective spending of scarce homeland security dollars, imposing new audit provisions, mandatory reporting, coordination among grant programs at different federal agencies, and requirements that individual expenditures be tied to achieving essential capabilities.
  The entire Congress now has the opportunity to make our country safer by adopting the Collins-Lieberman amendment.
