To the Editor:
 A single permanent site for the Olympics, in Greece, may not prove to be the panacea that you (editorial May 29) and others suggest.
The political squabbles that have been introduced into the Olympic competition will not necessarily vanish into thin air should the Games revert to Greece.
Nations will in all probability continue to choose not to compete with other nations, no matter where the Games are held.
Neither is the choice of Greece itself a guarantee of strife-free competition. For while democracy appears to be firmly rooted in that country at the moment, what would happen if, for example, a repressive military junta should reappear at some future date? Or what if Greece should choose to exclude Britain unless the Elgin Marbles were returned? Or if Turkey were excluded over some territorial dispute?
The real problem remains: How to divorce politics from the Olympic movement. In this day and age, alas, that appears to be impossible.
All this, of course, assumes that the Olympics really are worth rescuing. In the light of boycotts, terrorism, gross commercialization, steroid and other illegal drug use and the ''shamateurism'' engaged in by both Eastern bloc and Western countries, perhaps the Olympics are, after all, an ideal whose time has passed.
