As the execution of Timothy McVeigh looms for the worst act of domestic political violence in U.S. history, the White House and Senate yesterday explored ways to defend against terrorist attacks.
"Today, more nations possess chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons than ever before.
Still others seek to join them," President Bush said, announcing that Vice President Dick Cheney would conduct a review of America's ability to cope with a terrorist attack on U.S. soil.
The threat of those weapons being used against the United States, "while not immediate, is very real," Bush said. The results of the review are due by Oct. 1.
Although relatively few deadly acts of political violence have occurred on U.S. soil, there is a growing fear of vulnerability.
Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, testifying at the start of a three-day Senate hearing, said he was setting up a center to develop strategies for keeping track of finances of suspect groups and individuals.
In addition to concerns that potentially lethal substances could enter from other countries, "household products combined in the wrong combination can create devastation," he said.
"Just fertilizer with the right mixtures and things that are available on the Internet can create havoc in our country, and I worry about that. You don't need to import it to create terrorist acts," O'Neill said.
McVeigh is to be executed on May 16 by lethal injection for detonating a fertilizer truck bomb that blew up a federal building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people in 1995. *
