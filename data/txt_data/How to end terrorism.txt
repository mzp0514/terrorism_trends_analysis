The public has been brainwashed long enough! Those we call "terrorists" don't commit their acts because they hate freedom or because they are sick. It is clear they do it as a protest against the policies of a government. 
Those who study them all come to this conclusion.
The London and Madrid bombings were committed by those who opposed their government's cooperation with the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq. The attacks on 9-11 and before came about to oppose our government's support for continued violence by Israelis against Palestinians and because of our government and corporate influence over Middle East economies and oil resources.
We won't end potential terrorist acts with red alerts, more "homeland" security money, limiting civil liberties or any kind of "security" precautions.
The only way to end terrorism by others is to end our own, by changing our own govern-ment policies.
We can end terrorism if we are a nation of peace, not war. We can end it if we stop sending foreign aid to countries that use it to oppress others. We can be a nation that respects the people and cultures of other countries and creates trade relationships that are mutually beneficial.
We can end the fear of terrorism if the United States is respected in the world, not feared.
If we want to end terrorism by others and regain our own personal security, we need to "clean house" in Washington and get people in government who want our country to be respected again - not feared.
