The state's highest court on Tuesday threw out the conviction of a Bronx thug on grounds that he had been wrongly charged as a terrorist. It was the right move.
Edgar Morales, an admitted member of the violent St. James Boys street gang, had been found guilty of manslaughter and attempted murder in 2007 for shooting a rival gang member during a melee at a christening party in August 2002. A 10-year-old girl was killed in the spray of gunfire.
Inexplicably, District Attorney Robert Johnson not only filed standard criminal counts, but also charged Morales under an anti-terrorism statute passed by the Legislature after 9/11.
Lower courts bought the argument that gang-on-gang street crime could constitute terrorism. The Court of Appeals unanimously said: no way.
With crystal-clear common sense, the judges ruled that "the concept of terrorism has a unique meaning and its implications risk being trivialized if the terminology is applied loosely in situations that do not match our collective understanding of what constitutes a terrorist act."
But here's the beauty part: The DA who orchestrated this overreach is less aggressive in prosecuting other crimes than his fellow DAs.
Johnson has a shamefully low prosecution rate - just 43% of violent felony arrests, versus 54% citywide - and a policy of refusing to pursue a case unless cops interview the victim within a ridiculously short 24 hours.
On top of that, he has refused to prosecute those arrested for trespassing in public housing based on police stop-and-frisks - unless the arresting officers are interviewed and made to explain that their actions were warranted.
Johnson should focus on getting criminals behind bars - not pursing imaginary terrorists.
