Today marks the 10-year anniversary of the U.S. detention camp at Guantanamo Bay. Since its opening, the vast majority of its 775 detainees were released without charge. Now, 171 remain, and indefinite detention has officially become American law.
On Dec. 31, President Barack Obama signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act. Despite his "serious reservations," the president paved the way for future American presidents to detain prisoners indefinitely without charge with mere strokes of their pens.
Since 2001, the military tribunals at Guantanamo have concluded only six cases while America's domestic civilian courts have successfully prosecuted 523 terrorism related cases between 2001 and 2009.

The values we cherish and fight to maintain, such as the rule of law and freedom from tyranny, continue to erode.
