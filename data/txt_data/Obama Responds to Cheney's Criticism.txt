WASHINGTON -- President Obama has hit back at former Vice President Dick Cheney, calling Bush administration policy on detainees at the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, ''unsustainable.''
  ''How many terrorists have actually been brought to justice under the philosophy that is being promoted by Vice President Cheney?'' Mr. Obama said Friday in an interview to be broadcast Sunday on ''60 Minutes'' on CBS. 
  The president was responding to recent charges by Mr. Cheney that the administration's decision to shut down the Guantanamo prison, along with other policies on the treatment of terrorism suspects, would make the United States more vulnerable to attacks.
  Bush administration terrorism policy ''hasn't made us safer,'' Mr. Obama said, according to excerpts of the interview released Saturday. 
  ''What it has been,'' he continued, ''is a great advertisement for anti-American sentiment.''
  Mr. Obama defended the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, who has come under fire as public anger over bonuses paid to Wall Street executives has grown and the nation's economic crisis has deepened.
  Mr. Obama said he and Mr. Geithner had not discussed whether Mr. Geithner should resign. And even if Mr. Geithner offered to resign, the president joked that his response would be, ''Buddy, you've still got the job.''
