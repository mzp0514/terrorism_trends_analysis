CHICAGO (AP) - A federal appeals court on Wednesday upheld a $156 million judgment against three U.S.-based Islamic groups accused of bankrolling terrorism in a civil suit that was widely viewed as a landmark case. In a decision written by Judge Richard A. Posner, the appeals court held that donors to charities must be held liable if those charities engage in terrorist acts. 
The suit was filed in 2000 by the parents of American-born David Boim, who was a 17-year-old yeshiva student when he was killed by Hamas terrorists in a 1996 drive-by shooting at a bus stop on Israel's West Bank. The Boims' lawsuit claimed that the groups gave to Palestinian charities that ultimately helped fund terrorism. "This is the most significant judicial opinion on liability for terrorist financing ever decided by a United States court," said Chicago attorney Stephen Landes, who represented Boim's parents in their lawsuit. The decision upheld a lower-court judgment against the American Muslim Society, the Islamic Association for Palestine-National and the Quranic Literacy Institute. The appeals court also sent civil allegations against a fourth charity - the Texas-based Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development - back to U.S. District Court for a decision on whether it should have to pay part of the $156 million. But the court dropped a Chicago man, Muhammad Salah, as a defendant, saying he had been in a prisoner in an Israeli jail when the anti-terrorism law was passed, so could not have violated it.
