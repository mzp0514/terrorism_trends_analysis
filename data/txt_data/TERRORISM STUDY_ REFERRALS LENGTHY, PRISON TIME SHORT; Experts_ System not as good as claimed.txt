WASHINGTON - A new study shows that federal investigators have recommended the prosecution of an estimated 6,400 people on terrorism charges since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, but just a handful of those convicted received a prison sentence that exceeds 20 years.
And the median sentence for someone convicted of international terrorism was 14 days, according to the study released today by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), a nonpartisan research center at Syracuse University in New York.
Of the 184 people convicted of international terrorism during the last two years, 171 received no prison time or sentences of under one year, according to the study.
Some legal experts say the study shows that the Justice Department's attempt to crack down on terrorists is not as successful as Attorney General John Ashcroft and other Bush administration officials have claimed.
"This punctures the Justice Department's hype on terrorism in a dramatic and alarming way," said Timothy Edgar, legislative counsel to the American Civil Liberties Union in Washington.
"It is all right to arrest a suspected mobster for spitting on a sidewalk, but it's not all right to arrest everyone who spits on the sidewalk and call them a mobster and that is what they have done here," Edgar said.
The study's statistics were compiled from Justice Department data obtained through the Freedom of Information Act and a lengthy court battle.
Federal prosecutors decided to seek convictions in just one third of the 6,400 referrals. Prosecutors won convictions in 879 of the 2,001 cases.
