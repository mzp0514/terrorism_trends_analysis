MOSCOW (AP) - Russia's prime minister promised Friday to pursue peaceful ways of ending the war in Chechnya even as other reports indicated the rebels were planning a new terrorism campaign to avenge their leader's death.
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said his government will use ''all mechanisms and all possibilities to settle the Chechen conflict,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
He said Russia was committed not to return ''to the blood and terror of the war,'' and that President Boris Yeltsin's peace initiative would go forward.
Yeltsin has been eager to put the unpopular war on the back burner until after the June 16 election, in which he is seeking a second term. But the death of rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev this week has created new uncertainty about a slowing of fighting or possible peace talks in the 16-month war.
Chechen rebel leaders said Dudayev was killed Sunday in a Russian air strike and was buried in southern Chechnya at a site they refuse to reveal.
His successor, Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, has ruled out peace talks with Moscow until Dudayev's killers are found and punished, Russian television said.
Sergei Stepashin, former head of Russia's Federal Security Service, said rebels were planning at least a dozen acts of terrorism to avenge Dudayev's death.
