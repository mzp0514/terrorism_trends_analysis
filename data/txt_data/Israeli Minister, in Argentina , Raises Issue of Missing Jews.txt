BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 14 (AP) -Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel told Argentina's President and Foreign Minister today that Israel is concerned about nearly 1,000 Jews who disappeared during the military regime's war on leftist terrorism from 1975 to 1979.
Foreign Ministry sources said Mr. Shamir expressed Israel's concern about the ''desaparecidos'' - the ''disappeared ones'' - and particularly the Jews among them. Human rights organizations say 6,000 to 15,000 people disappeared in the five-year period, most of them after being rounded up by security forces.
The Foreign Ministry sources said Mr. Shamir and Mr. Aguirre Lanari also discussed Israeli arms sales to Argentina and the possibility Argentina might officially recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization.
