EXPERTS OFFER TIPS TO TAKE BACK NIGHT
TAMPA - Tossing and turning at night instead of sleeping is a problem for millions of Americans and feeling rested after the past two weeks may be even more difficult.
A third of Americans experience chronic insomnia, the inability to fall asleep or stay asleep that produces daytime fatigue, sleep specialist William Kohler says.
But even those who usually don't have sleep problems may be experiencing them now.
Stress or disruption of former routines can create conditions that make it hard to relax and go to sleep, said Kohler, a physician at University Community Hospital.
Kohler suggests that people remember to practice good "sleep hygiene" to return to normal.
For instance, avoid caffeine in the afternoon and evening. Get aerobic exercise during the day, but not close to bedtime. Start winding down at least an hour before going to sleep, avoiding news reports about the terrorist attacks or stimulating movies, TV shows and books.
Because worries can keep people from falling asleep, Kohler teaches a technique that helps his patients let go.
"A half-hour before going to bed, make a list of everything that worries you, then fold it, put it away and do something relaxing," he said.
"My patients tell me this works."
