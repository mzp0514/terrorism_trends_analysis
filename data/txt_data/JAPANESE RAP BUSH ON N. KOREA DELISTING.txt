TOKYO -- A day after the Bush administration removed North Korea from its terrorism blacklist, the country announced yesterday it would resume tearing down its main nuclear plant, and South Korea welcomed the move as a step toward ending its next-door neighbor's nuclear program.
But in nearby Japan -- where North Korea's kidnapping of Japanese citizens is a festering national sore -- the decision to take the country off the blacklist was condemned by family members of the abductees. These relatives are much-honored in Japan, and their opinions have been a powerful force in crafting Japan's hard-nosed policy toward North Korean leader Kim Jong Il.
"I think it is an act of betrayal," said Teruaki Masumoto, a brother of one of the eight Japanese who were stolen away by North Korean agents in the 1970s and '80s and who the government says are still alive in North Korea. Mr. Masumoto is secretary general of the Association of the Families of Victims Kidnapped by North Korea.
"Why did the United States remove North Korea from the list when it is clear to anyone's eyes that the North is a terrorism-assisting country?" asked Sakie Yokota, 72, whose daughter, Megumi Yokota, was 13 when she was kidnapped nearly 31 years ago and is by far the most famous of the abductees.
In Washington on Saturday, Japanese Finance Minister Shoichi Nakagawa told reporters that the U.S. decision was "extremely regrettable." He said that "abductions amount to terrorist acts."
For more than 18 months, the Bush administration has made a seismic shift from denunciation of North Korea toward flexible diplomacy.
