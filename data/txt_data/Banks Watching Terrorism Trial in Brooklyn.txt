Highlight: Arab Bank warns of a troubling precedent if following standard compliance procedures means a bank can still be held liable if transactions get through in error.

Banks are watching the first civil trial against a bank under the Anti-Terrorism Act with some trepidation. Opening arguments start in the United States District Court in Brooklyn on Thursday.
The lawsuit accuses Arab Bank of knowingly handling accounts and money for terrorists. Arab Bank says it checked its account holders against the appropriate lists of designated terrorists. The bank says it could not turn over important records the plaintiffs sought because of foreign-bank secrecy laws. But that is not an argument that the bank will be allowed to make to the jury.
If following standard compliance procedures means a bank can still be held liable if transactions get through in error, that would set a troubling precedent, the bank contends.
A liability finding could cause banks to further pull back from doing business in turbulent parts of the world. Already, HSBC has been closing accounts of some Muslim charities, saying they don't fit its risk profile, while JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup have            all pulled back on money transfers to areas like Mexico.
The case has already divided the Obama administration, pitting treasury and tax officials who did not want foreign-bank secrecy laws to have precedence in United States cases, against State Department officials who felt Jordan, where the bank has its headquarters, was an important ally.
