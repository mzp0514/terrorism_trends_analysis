Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., spoke about the dangers of being unprepared for a cyber attack Wednesday, as the Senate moved forward Thursday with the Cybersecurity Act by voting to allow debate on the legislation.
The legislation, which Rockefeller helped first introduce in February as a chief author of the bill, would create a National Cybersecurity Council that would develop safety defenses against cyber attack. It also would organize research about cybersecurity and work to increase public awareness about the issue.
Rockefeller said in a statement issued Thursday that the country's electric grid, transportation systems, gas pipelines and telecommunications systems all use online networks - and they are all inadequately protected.
"Our intellectual property, perhaps our greatest asset as a nation, is currently being pilfered and stolen because it is connected to the Internet and is unsecure," he said in the statement. "Experts have called this thievery the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of the world."
Rockefeller, a member and former chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said that both parties understand the threat that breaches of government data pose and that Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Robert Mueller told Congress that cyber security would soon replace terrorism as the FBI's primary focus.
To close his statement, Rockefeller said the federal government saw warning signs before 9/11 but didn't heed them. He said the country is once again faced with a choice as it relates to national security.
"Act now, and put in place safeguards to protect this country and our people," he said. "Or act later, when it is too late. We must act now."
