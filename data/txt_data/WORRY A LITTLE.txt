Terrorism might strike this year's Olympic Games in Sydney - but "International Olympic Committee chairman Juan Antonio Samaranch said he is not worried," reports the AP.
Security is the responsibility of the governments of Australia and New South Wales and we have no fears.
A word of advice for Samaranch: Do not take Olympic security - or terrorism - lightly.
Many remember the 1972 Summer Games in Munich, in which Palestinian terrorists seized and killed 11 Israeli athletes.
Montreal, Moscow, Los Angeles, Seoul, and Barcelona proved safer.
Then, Atlanta.
According to a Dallas Morning News story from July 15, 1996, Atlanta authorities viewed terrorism as a threat, but paid more attention to muggings and assaults: "The officials planning for the Games say their biggest fear isn't a bombing, it's a convergence of thieves and robbers that would rival the Games themselves."
The Atlanta Olympics' head of security told the Dallas daily, "We know how to stop terrorism, but focusing just on that would mean ignoring the muggers . . . . We are very aware that if muggings, assaults, and other crimes against visitors become the story of these Games, then we have failed."
The Olympic security team did not fail because of any reporting of pickpockets and such. Rather the headlines of the< ze>*'96 Games focused on (1) Michael Johnson exploding to a record-shattering 19.32 seconds in the 200-meter finals, shaving 0.34 seconds from his old mark, and (2) a pipeir15p10,16l>bomb explosion in Centennial Olympic Park, killing two and injuring more than 100.
While Atlanta knew how to stop terrorism, it focused on other things and could not stop a simple pipe bomb. Sydney's cops and the IOC chairman say possible terrorism does not worry them - but it should.
