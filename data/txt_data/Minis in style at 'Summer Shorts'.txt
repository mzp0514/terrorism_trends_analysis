The famous quote "If I had more time, I would have written less" is attributed to Mark Twain and Blaise Pascal, among others.
Whoever said it, the point is a valid one; writing that is clear, tight and in which every word matters doesn't come instantly.
That holds true for one-act plays, which are the name of the game at Summer Shorts 2012, running through Sept. 1 at 59E59 Theaters, 59 E. 59th St. Tickets are $25.
The sampler, presented in two separate evenings, features the premieres of six playlets by American writers at every stage in their career.
Established dramatists include "reasons to be pretty" writer Neil LaBute, whose mini work about a breakup is called "The Furies," and "I Hate Hamlet" author Paul Rudnick, whose compact comedy about a flight attendant is titled "Cabin Pressure."
Also in the mix are Sam Davis and Sean Hartley's "Love and Real Estate," Nancy Giles' "The Accidental Pundette," Wendy Kesselman's "Spit" and James McLure's "Drive-In Dreams."
A schedule is at summershortsfestival.com.
The festival is billed as a celebration of "theater, summer and the short form." And in the case of the reliably hilarious Rudnick - laughter.
His bite-sized play starring frequent collaborator Peter Bartlett is a portrait of an airline steward fighting terrorism on a trip to L.A. packed with Golden Globes nominees.
He adds, " It is a story of triumph."
Rudnick is totally serious when he says crafting "a short play is a real science. You have to be extremely concise," he acknowledges. "It's about paring things down and focus. Every second counts."
