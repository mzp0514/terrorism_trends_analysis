Two Islamic terrorist cells were competing to become the first to stage a major bombing in Australia, a prosecutor said Tuesday.
He spoke after police arrested 17 suspects in a series of pre-dawn raids in two cities.
About 500 police officers arrested nine men in the southern city of Melbourne and eight in Sydney. Police said they expected more arrests in coming days and weeks. Federal police raided another home in Sydney on Tuesday night but reported no arrests.
"The police forces of this country might just have prevented a catastrophic act of terrorism" in Melbourne or Sydney, said New South Wales Police Minister Carl Scully.
Suspect Abdulla Merhi wanted to avenge the war in Iraq, police said in a Melbourne court. Prime Minister John Howard was a strong supporter of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and has dispatched hundreds of soldiers to that country.
The head of the state's counterterrorism police unit said the suspects were followers of Osama bin Laden.
"That is what terrorism in its modern form is all about, and there's no doubt that this group followed that same philosophy," said the official, Norm Hazzard.
Last week, Howard strengthened counterterrorism laws after saying intelligence agencies had warned of a terrorist attack. After the arrests, he went on national TV to say the risk remained.
"This country has never been immune from a possible terrorist attack," he said. "That remains the situation today, and it will be the situation tomorrow."
