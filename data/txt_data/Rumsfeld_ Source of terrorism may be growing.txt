The United States and its allies are winning some battles in the terrorism war but may be losing the broader struggle against Islamic extremism that is terrorism's source, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said yesterday.
The troubling unknown, he said, is whether the extremists - whom he termed "zealots and despots" - are turning out newly trained terrorists faster than the United States can capture or kill them.
"It's quite clear to me that we do not have a coherent approach to this," Rumsfeld said at an international security conference.
His remarks showed a level of concern about the long-term direction of the U.S.-led global fight against terrorism that Rumsfeld rarely addresses in public.
The Pentagon chief usually lauds the efforts of U.S. troops, denounces terrorist networks, and urges other countries to join the effort to stop terrorist acts.
Yesterday he went further, saying that while terrorists must be confronted, the bigger problem is the extremist Islamic ideology that produces them.
"What you have is a civil war in that religion where a small minority are trying to hijack it," he said.
Rumsfeld said it was impossible to know whether the United States and its allies were winning or losing the fight against extremists.
"How many more of those folks are being trained and developed and organized and deployed and sent out to work the seams and the shadows and the caves?" he asked.
"We need to do even more than simply attempt to capture, kill or thwart terrorists. We have to find ways to persuade young Muslims that the way of the future is through education and opportunity, not through suicide and terrorism."
