WASHINGTON - The United States and Britain demanded Wednesday that Libya surrender two intelligence agents indicted in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 and accept responsibility for the act.  Washington and London also pressed Libya to pay ''appropriate compensation'' and to ''disclose all it knows about this crime,'' including the names of those responsible for the bombing.
A total of 270 people, including 11 on the ground, were killed when a bomb blew apart the New York-bound flight over Lockerbie, Scotland on Dec. 21, 1988.  The two nations gave no deadlines for compliance with the demands or say what action would be taken if Libya did not comply.  They called on Libya to allow full access to witnesses, documents and material evidence, including timers that could be used in bombing devices.  France joined the United States and Britain in a statement declaring their commitment to putting an end to terrorism.  The three countries demanded that Libya comply with all demands made in connection with the bombings of Pan Am 103 and French UTA 772. France is seeking four Libyan agents believed responsible for blowing up the French civilian jet on a flight from Brazzavile, Congo, to Paris in 1989.  U.S. and Scottish investigators charged this month that the Pan Am bombing had been carried out by two Libyan intelligence agents.
