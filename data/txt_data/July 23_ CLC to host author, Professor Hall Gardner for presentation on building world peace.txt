Growing and sustaining world peace, in light of a rapidly-changing international order, is the topic of a presentation by author and Professor Hall Gardner, Ph.D., at the College of Lake County from 6-8 p.m. Tuesday, July 23 in the Room A011 Auditorium on the Grayslake Campus. Admission is free. Gardner's focus is on the diplomatic origins of war, and his research blends history and theory with contemporary international affairs. His work concentrates on questions involving NATO and European Union expansion, and he will discuss key regional conflicts with a focus on the renewed U.S.-Russian-Chinese arms race, as well as the global ramifications of the "war on terrorism." A Q & A session will follow the presentation. Gardner has been professor of international and comparative politics at American University in Paris since 1990, and he has taught and guest lectured worldwide. Among his areas of teaching and research are origins and prevention of war and conflict transformation and resolution. Gardner, who earned an M.A. and Ph.D. at Johns Hopkins University, is the author of 13 books, including "American Global Strategy and the â€˜War on Terrorism,'" and is a published poet.
