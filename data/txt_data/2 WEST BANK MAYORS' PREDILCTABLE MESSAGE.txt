To the Editor:
There should be no surprise that West Bank Mayors Milhem and Hawasme refuse to condemn P.L.O. terrorism. Their statements at Temple Sinai in Washington, on the air and elsewhere depict the P.L.O. in a war of liberation in which everything goes.
AN-A
Anyone of military age, in uniform or not and even if at Olympic Games, is a proper target. Hostage-taking is a legitimate effort to free P.L.O. fighters. Civilian aircraft, buses and cars are in the emergency military transport system. Vegetable markets are part of the military-industrial complex. Supporters of Israel are collaborators.
The mayors go beyond rejecting or evading demands to recognize the legitimacy of Israel. They deny the legitimacy of the request.  Theirs was not an offer of peace at Temple Sinai. It was an invitation for surrender interspersed with humanitarian phrases and hostility-courting statements. Has anyone ever expressed concern about potential U.S.S.R. ICBM's on the West Bank as the security issue?
The record indicated what the mayors would say. There was no reason to expect them to reveal a stance on which peace might proceed. Their U.S. tour is useful, but not in the manner expected by its sponsors.  Waking from the romantic dream of an ultimately reasonable P.L.O. is essential to understanding what the peace process requires.
