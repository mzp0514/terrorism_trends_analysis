Americans should expect something similar to the Beslan hostage crisis within the next five to seven years. Terrorism is a game of copycats and knowledge is passed through the simplest venue, the media.
For a sample, analyze the actions the Chechen-affiliated terrorists took prior to Beslan.
 On Sept. 1 a suicide bombing (the means of Palestinian groups) killed 10. Days later two planes went down (in a coordinated attack similar to 9/11) by bombing (see Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie). These actions connected together as one "offensive operation" (like similar al-Qaida operations) and culminated in a spectacular, bold hostage crisis (like the one in 1995 perpetrated by Chechen Shamil Basayev). This group certainly intensified the hostage crisis by taking children.
 Americans should be prepared for something similar. Imagine al-Qaida storming an elementary school in New York City or Montana, a dormitory at Harvard or Stanford, or even a privately owned preschool. The situation in Iraq will intensify the likelihood of these attacks. If U.S. forces gain more control (hopefully without the Russian tactics of mass killings and mass rape), Iraqis will have no choice but to take the fight to America (just as the Chechens took the fight to Russia).
