ON EARMARKS:"We get calls on a regular basis from people saying 'I'm against earmarks.' Well, I say, 'Are you opposed to fixing U.S. 19, to make it a safe highway?' 'Oh, no, no.' 'Well, that was an earmark.' I say, 'Are you opposed to building that new hospital for veterans?' 'No, absolutely not.' 'Well, that was an earmark.' The trouble is the media has reported earmarks as something evil without actually reporting exactly what earmarks can do. I would agree that probably some of the congressional earmarks should have never been approved and there probably should have been a better system."
