WASHINGTON (AP) -- Osama bin Laden, the elusive Islamic militant who has publicly pledged to drive the U.S. military out of the Middle East, is a focus of the USS Cole bombing investigation, but investigators have no hard evidence he was behind it, several American officials said Friday.
Meantime, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and FBI Director Louis Freeh appealed in a joint statement for greater cooperation from the Yemeni government.
FBI agents have encountered the same problem they had in an earlier terrorism investigation in Saudi Arabia no direct access to suspects.
The FBI, working with Yemeni authorities in the port of Aden, where the Cole was attacked Oct. 12 by a small boat laden with explosives, has finished examining the crippled ship and scouring various locations in Yemen for physical evidence, Albright and Freeh said. They did not identify the sites.
Albright and Freeh praised Yemen for its "early cooperation." The FBI was given full access to the sites, and it sent key evidence to Washington for detailed lab tests. But they are seeking more access now.
"The next critical phase will require Yemeni and U.S. personnel to work as partners in the collection of information and participants in the interview process of witnesses to this criminal act of terrorism," Albright and Freeh said.
