At least two Vietnamese tourists are dead and 10 people are injured after a blast rocked a bus travelling in the Giza area, Egypt's Interior Ministry said.
Two of the killed tourists are from Vietnam.
No one immediately claimed responsibility.
Photos surfaced on social media allegedly showing the attack site with the crumpled wreckage of the bus.
Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly was reported to be following the attack's updates along with the interior minister, Giza Governor and other security bodies.
The bus hit the device after it went off its planned route without alerting security forces, Mr Madbouly added.
An investigator at the scene said the device had likely been planted near the wall.
More than 450 suspected militants and around 30 Egyptian soldiers have been killed since the offensive began, the army said in October. The wounded included 10 Vietnamese tourists.
Egypt has for years been battling an insurgency in North Sinai, which surged following the 2013 military ouster of president Mohamed Morsi.
The government says fighting Islamist militants is a priority as it works to restore stability after the years of turmoil that followed the "Arab spring" protests of 2011.
Egypt's neighbours in the region condemned the attack and the British Ambassador to Cairo, Geoffrey Adams, said the United Kingdom stood "with Egypt in the fight against terrorism".
However, this is the first attack to target foreign tourists in nearly two years.
