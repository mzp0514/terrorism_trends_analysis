An editorial from

Environmental radicals like to envision themselves, in a bizarre sort of way, as guardians of the environment. But environmental terrorism, by its very nature, often amounts to an attack on the environment itself in order to make a political point.
One example is last week's destruction of 500 research trees at a federal forestry laboratory near Rhinelander, Wis., where scientists have spent years looking for a cure for a disease that attacks poplar trees.
The North American Earth Liberation Front, an underground environmental activist organization, has claimed responsibility for sawing down the rare nursery stock.
The group said its attack was aimed at bio-engineering. But scientists at the facility, run by the U.S. Forestry Sciences Laboratory, said their work involved only traditional plant-breeding techniques.
Over the years, those same techniques have made various species of plants, including trees and crops, hardier and more vigorous and thus able to withstand drought, disease and insect infestation.
This irresponsible and mindless attack, in which young red oaks and other species were also destroyed, set back the research project by 10 to 15 years, one scientist said.
The radicals are not tree-huggers; they're muggers.
