Editor, New Era:
In regard to Montaque McFadden's pro-Islam, anti-America letter: The writer is not thinking clearly.
First, any clear-thinking, patriotic American can only hope that our great President Bush never relents on his vendetta against Osama bin Laden.
#MAR.J3.CAP00s#I, for one, don't want bin Laden dead or alive. I want him dead-dead!
Second, McFadden complains that nearly 60 years ago, old Harry Truman dropped the bomb to end the war in the Pacific (thank God he did!). He did right! Many a thousand military personnel have had a chance to live out their lives.
In any event, the United States uses the bomb as a deterrent to save lives, not take lives, as Saddam Hussein and North Korea both plan to do.
As for Israel having the bomb, I hope they have more than just one bomb, for it is surrounded by many larger Arab countries which want to annihilate Israel and its citizens off the face of the earth.
In any event, in one way I think like McFadden. I do not fear bin Laden and his clan, nor Saddam Hussein, nor even North Korea, as much as I fear Hillary Clinton selling the balance of her soul and our country down the river so that she can become our first pro-Marxist president. In this respect, I regret that I do not have the same courage as Patrick Henry.
Shame on a nation which no longer remembers its heroes!
