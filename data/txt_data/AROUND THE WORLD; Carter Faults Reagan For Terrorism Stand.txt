Former President Jimmy Carter said today that President Reagan's denunciation of international terrorism was ''a mistake.''
Mr. Carter, here on vacation, said at a news conference: ''Terrorism can be dealt with quietly and effectively rather than with threats addressed to a world audience.
Former Pres Jimmy Carter, at news conference while vacationing in Corfu, Greece, holds Pres Reagan's denunciation of international terrorism is 'a mistake'; disagrees with Reagan's 'basic premises of an international conspiracy, of collusion in terrorism' and holds it should be dealt with 'quietly and effectively' (S)That's a mistake for the leader of a great nation like ours.''
He said he disagreed with Mr. Reagan's ''basic premises of an international conspiracy, of collusion in terrorism between nations and whole peoples.''
Mr. Carter spoke at the end of a weekend visit to this Greek resort island, where he met Saturday with Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou of Greece.
He said he and Mr. Papandreou had discussed the State Department travel advisory warning Americans to avoid the Athens airport because of what it called inadequate security. He said that the advisory should be rescinded ''in a short time'' and that Mr. Papandreou had assured him that security at the airport was now adequate.
