A FORMER Flushing High School football player who conspired with classmates to wage jihad in New York City using suicide attacks on the subway was convicted Tuesday of terrorism.
Adis Medunjanin tried to console his parents - Bosnian refugees - after he was found guilty of nine charges, including conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction.
"It's okay," the bearded terrorist said.
Then Medunjanin, 28, who faces life in prison when he is sentenced Sept. 7, hugged his lawyer Robert Gottlieb and was led away.
"His conviction stands as a stark reminder of terrorists' desire long after 9/11 to return to the city to kill more New Yorkers," said Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly.
Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said the Medunjanin case "
afforded a rare glimpse into the inner workings of Al Qaeda."
The Queens menace was just days away from setting the twisted plot into motion with two other losers he had met at Flushing High - Zarein
Ahmedzay, 27, and Najibullah Zazi, 26.
Zazi had built a working detonator and Medunjanin offered up the basement of the Manhattan building where he worked as a place to build the explosives.
But after the trio was arrested in 2009, Zazi and Ahmedzay turned and testified against Medunjanin.
They said the plot was hatched after they traveled to Pakistan in 2008 to avenge the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan.
They said they were trained by Al Qaeda and sent home to launch a suicide mission.
Before settling on the subway
system, they considered bombing the New York Stock Exchange, Times Square and Grand Central Terminal.
Their plan was to attack around the eighth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks
