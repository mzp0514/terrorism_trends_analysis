30-year mortgage raterises to 3.62 percent 
WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) - Average U.S. rates on fixed mortgages ticked up for the third straight week, staying slightly above record lows. Cheap mortgages have helped fuel a modest housing recovery this year. 
Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said the rate on the 30-year loan increased to 3.62 percent, up from 3.59 percent last week. Three weeks ago, the rate fell to 3.49 percent, the lowest since long-term mortgages began in the 1950s. 
Survey rates TSAhighly on security 
LOS ANGELES (LAT) - Despite all the griping over full-body searches of children and senior citizens, most Americans think the Transportation Security Administration is doing either a good or excellent job of handling security at airports. 
During a recent Gallup poll, 54 percent of Americans said the agency in charge of security at airports is doing a good or excellent job, with an additional 30 percent saying the TSA does only a fair job. 
Only 12 percent of those surveyed said the TSA does a poor job. 
And how effective are the TSA screening procedures? A total of 85 percent of those surveyed said the procedures are either extremely effective, very effective or somewhat effective at preventing acts of terrorism, according to the survey.
