Investors sent stocks lower yesterday as the market's uneasiness over terrorism and future earnings overshadowed an unexpected drop in wholesale prices and another series of upbeat profit reports.
While second-quarter earnings in the financial and technology sectors came in above estimates, stocks moved in and out of negative territory for much of the day, partly because of options expirations today. Investors also were increasingly concerned about third- and fourth-quarter profit outlooks, as well as a number of economic and political issues, analysts said.
"It's extremely frustrating. Earnings are good, fundamentals are good, but all these other worries - terrorism, oil prices, interest rates, the election - are keeping people on the sidelines," said Richard A. Dickson, senior market strategist at Lowry's Research Reports. "I think the great earnings we have here were baked into the market last year. Now we're waiting for some other reason to go up or down."
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 45.64, or 0.4 percent, to 10,163.16. The Standard & Poor's 500 index was down 4.78, or 0.4 percent, at 1,106.69, and the Nasdaq composite index slipped 2.17, or 0.1 percent, to 1,912.71.
The Producer Price Index dropped 0.3 percent in June, according to the Labor Department - a sign that inflation might not be as serious an issue as some had feared. Economists had expected a slight rise. And the Commerce Department said inventories rose 0.4 percent in May, while sales climbed 0.7 percent, signs that businesses are increasing their investments and that consumers are rewarding their efforts.
Jobs, however, continue to be an area of concern. First-time jobless claims rose by 40,000 for the week to 349,000. The Labor Department blamed seasonal adjustments at the nation's automakers for the increase.
Most investors chose to wait out the session in advance of International Business Machines Corp.'s earnings, which came out after the market's close. IBM, which beat estimates by 4 cents a share, was down 11 cents at $84.02 for the regular session, but rose 37 cents to $84.39 in after-hours trading.
"I think some people are looking to IBM, but there are plenty who are just waiting, period," said Matt Kelmon, portfolio manager of the Kelmoore Strategy Funds. "Nobody's worried that the market's about to cave, but there's no catalyst for the upside either."
Despite a massive one-time charge to settle lawsuits over the WorldCom Inc. scandal, Citigroup Inc. managed to beat Wall Street estimates for the second quarter by 5 cents a share. And Wachovia Corp. exceeded expectations by 2 cents a share on record quarterly earnings. Citigroup was down 89 cents at $44.21, while Wachovia slipped 32 cents to $44.37.
The long-suffering technology sector received a boost from a pair of positive earnings reports. Apple Computer Inc. surged $3.35 to $32.93 after beating Wall Street expectations by 2 cents a share, thanks to strong sales of its iPod music players and its laptop computers. Flash-memory-producer SanDisk Inc. surged past estimates by 8 cents a share on an 85 percent jump in revenue. SanDisk climbed $4.11 to $24.09.
Not all the technology earnings news was positive. Nokia Corp. skidded $1.79 to $12.45 after announcing that sales fell in the second quarter and warning that competition and dropping cell-phone prices could affect its future profitability.
In other earnings news, PepsiCo Inc. fell $1.49 to $51.92 after meeting analysts' estimates but showing weakness in its Quaker brand products.
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 2.42, or 0.4 percent, at 562.16.
Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.5 percent, Britain's FTSE 100 closed down 0.7 percent, France's CAC-40 fell 1.1 percent, and Germany's DAX index lost 1.3 percent.
