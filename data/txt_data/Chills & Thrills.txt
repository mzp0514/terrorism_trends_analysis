The new novel from Karin Slaughter ,
The Last Widow (William Morrow, Aug. 20), $28 , does what all great Slaughter books do: keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's a chilling whodunit for our times (extremism! terrorism!) set in Atlanta and featuring returning reader favorites: medical examiner Sara Linton and her partner Will Trent, an investigator with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Go to Parade.com/slaughter for an interview with the author.
Here, Slaughter shares with
Parade what she's been reading.
We Are All Good People Here (Atria Books), $27 , by Susan Rebecca White "Few books capture the zeitgeist the way this one does. It's a riveting look at the way the past can carve out complications that only become evident with the passage of time."
The Better Sister (Harper), $27 , by Alafair Burke "In addition to being a gripping thriller, this is a poignant look at the lives of two very different sisters-and how seemingly inconsequential events can often bring about great sacrifices. Burke gets better with each new read."
Their Little Secret (Atlantic Monthly Press), $26 , by Mark Billingham "This is the latest entry in the Tom Thorne series, but it reads as pacey and exciting as the first. I love how the reader knows more about the crime than the detectives."
Available in bookstores and online
