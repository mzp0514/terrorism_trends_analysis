To the Editor:
Apparently, there has been a good deal of misunderstanding about my remarks quoted in a Sept. 8 article.
A reporter telephoned to ask my reaction to terrorism; she did not ask for my specific reaction to the ghastly massacre in the synagogue in Istanbul, but rather my reaction to terrorism in general (or so I thought).
We had about a 10-minute conversation, from which one or two sentences of my remarks were quoted, to the effect that I did not condone terrorism, but felt that the reasons behind it needed to be examined and that retaliation was not enough.
I was surprised that these remarks were taken to be insensitive by some members of the Jewish community, with which I have worked closely for at least 36 years. We have had many conferences on Jewish-Christian relations at our cathedral, we have a bay in the cathedral dedicated as a memorial to the Holocaust, and going back many years, we have a pair of menorahs on either side of the high altar given to the cathedral for the helpfulness of my predecessor, Bishop Manning, to the Jewish community.
I abhor any mindless murder, massacre, terrorism of any kind, and I am deeply aware how this kind of persecution has been visited on the Jewish people for centuries. As a Christian, I consider myself Jewish in my religion in the sense that my roots are Jewish roots. Jesus Christ was a Jew, and we are bound together as brothers and sisters under one God.
