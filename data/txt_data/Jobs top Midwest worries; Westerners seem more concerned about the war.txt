The health of the economy weighs heavily on Midwesterners, while the problem of war looms large in the West.
Which problem is the nation's most important depends a great deal on where people live, AP-Ipsos polling found.
When asked in an open-ended question to name the most important problem facing the United States, people in the nation's heartland were very likely to mention the economy and jobs.
"We're more economically challenged in the Midwest than other regions of the country," said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at LaSalle Bank, headquartered in Chicago.
In contrast, people in the West were far more likely to be concerned about war generally. Three in 10 Westerners named that as the top issue, twice the number in the South and Midwest.
"They're dragging it out," Walter Martin, a retiree who lives near Jackson, Calif., said of Iraq. "Troops are getting killed. It's like Vietnam."
Southerners and Northeasterners were more likely to be worried about a cross-section of issues - with war and the economy still playing a big role along with numerous domestic issues like morality, energy and political leadership. But neither the war nor the economy dominated in either of those regions.
One problem mentioned by about one in 20 was the nation's political leadership - from the president to politicians generally.
"It seems to me that Democrats and Republicans can't do anything," said Fred Miller, a retiree from Clinton, Ill. "They are stalled all the time."
The top problem question was asked of 501 adults between April 4-6 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.
