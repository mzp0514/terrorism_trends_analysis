LOS ANGELES - An arsonist swept through the Hollywood area under the cover of dark early Friday, torching vehicles whose flames ignited nearby houses, including one once occupied by Doors frontman Jim Morrison.
The four-hour onslaught started shortly after midnight and sent firefighters scrambling to douse fires in 21 locations in Hollywood and the neighboring city of West Hollywood. In nearly every case, the fire started in a parked car.
Authorities ruled out any possible link to terrorism while bracing for another round of fires and continuing the search for a suspect.
"We are hoping for the best but anticipating and preparing for the worst," Los Angeles City Fire Chief Brian Cummings said.
Los Angeles officials urged continued public vigilance Friday and offered at least $35,000 in rewards for information leading to the conviction of an arsonist or arsonists.
County supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said the county is offering a $25,000 reward and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is adding another $10,000.
The City Council is drafting a motion to add another $25,000 to that sum, but councilman Tom LaBonge urges citizens to come forward with any information they have immediately.
Dozens of people were rousted from their homes, power was disrupted in several neighborhoods and Los Angeles police were put on alert in the Hollywood area.
