To the Editor:
A. M. Rosenthal (column, Nov. 22), writing on nuclear proliferation, mentions the suicide of the Russian scientist Vladimir Nechai. The suicide underscores the circumstances faced by nuclear weapons scientists in Russia and the former Soviet states. With many receiving salaries below a living wage, the potential exists for them to be drawn to work in countries seeking to build these weapons.
The United States has a program to address this aspect of the proliferation problem. It is modest but a real achievement. Under Energy Department auspices, the Industrial Partnering Program has set up projects employing Russian scientists and engineers to identify and vet technologies from Russian weapons laboratories with civilian applications. When American companies identify one they are willing to invest in, the program provides matching funds to support the participation of the Russians.
American universities provide technical expertise and training. The programs have been established with 160 Russian and former Soviet bloc laboratories and have provided matching funds to support 2,000 Russian scientists and engineers in 200 projects.
