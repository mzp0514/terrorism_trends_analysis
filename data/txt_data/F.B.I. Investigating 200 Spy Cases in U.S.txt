The F.B.I. is investigating about 200 spy cases nationwide despite the end of the cold war, a senior bureau official says.
"That's a good number," Raymond A. Mislock, the chief of the national security section of the field office here, said on Friday when asked about that figure in a discussion with reporters. "We have an extremely high number of espionage allegations."
The Russian intelligence agencies in Washington, Mr. Mislock said, are the "largest in the world."
"And it's not just the Russians," he added. "The threat comes from throughout the world. "Some people in Government who should have known better assumed this would die with the end of the cold war."
Mr. Mislock handles both counterespionage and counterterrorism cases in Washington and northern Virginia and terrorism cases against Americans in the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Growing instances of domestic terrorism, like the Oklahoma City bombing, prompted the bureau to assign more agents to counterterrorism, he said.
A year ago, F.B.I. headquarters had one section of agents dealing with terrorism. Now, one section deals with domestic terrorism and another section with international terrorism. For a terrorism analysis section, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is hiring academicians and borrowing experts from the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency.
"The domestic threat has become more of a concern than previously," Mr. Mislock said. "And the international threat has stayed very high."
