A Nov. 12 presentation at Big Bend Community College that's titled "No. I am not a terrorist" aims to better educate Americans about Muslims today.
Zohra Sarwari, an Orthodox Muslim woman who came to the country at 6 years old, will speak at BBCC at 1 p.m. in the Masto Conference Center.
Sarwari mixes humor, enthusiasm, and passion with her personal story to help audiences understand terrorism, Islam, and Muslims today.
Sarwari came to America with her parents as a refugee from Afghanistan.
Since that young age she has been exposed to intolerance and bigotry, initially when living in New York City, then moving to the suburbs of Virginia, to a high school in California and finally residing in Indiana.
She married at 19 then worked, went to college and had four children. She eventually earned a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology and a Master's in Business Administration.
Today Sarwari is an established author, life coach, entrepreneur and speaker. She travels the country with a passion for educating people about diversity, using humor and personal experiences.
Sarwari will discuss what Islam says about terrorism and why Muslim women wear a veil.
The event is sponsored by the BBCC Associated Student Body.
Admission is free and open to the public.
