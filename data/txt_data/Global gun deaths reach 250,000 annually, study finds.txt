About 250,000 gun deaths occur annually worldwide, nearly two-thirds of which were homicides, according to a study published Tuesday by the Journal of the American Medical Association . But the global population expanded more rapidly during that period. The average rate, about 4 per 100,000 people, was mostly unchanged.
The study tallied gun deaths in 195 different countries and territories from 1990 to 2016. In 1990, there were 209,000 firearm-related deaths. The United States, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela and Guatemala together account for more than half of the gun-related deaths worldwide.
In 2016, the majority of globalfirearm deaths - an estimated 64% - were homicides. Suicides accounted for 27% of the gun deaths.
