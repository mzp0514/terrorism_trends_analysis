The Bush administration's first real foreign policy test is likely to come in the Mideast.
The leaders of both political parties are talking vaguely about restoration of nonpartisan cooperation abroad, but it's mostly talk. What both need is more precision on policy toward Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
The parties have long agreed that Israel's security is a ''vital interest'' of America. The same thing has been said about our relations with the NATO allies and Japan, with one important difference. We have made it clear to our friends and adversaries that we would oppose the conquest of the Western European allies or Japan, with military action if necessary. But no such clear commitment covers our relations with Israel.
That country is described as our principal Mideast ally, and no leader of either party has ever suggested that we would permit its destruction. This policy has never been formalized by treaty, and Israel's enemies keep nibbling away at its security as if they could achieve their aims without facing United States power.
The Reagan Administration has taken Yasir Arafat's word that he opposes ''terrorism'' and recognizes Israel's ''right to exist'' within secure borders, in accordance with Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, but he does not recognize Israel's present borders and does not regard the present subversive warfare against Israel as ''terrorism.''
Meanwhile, officials here urge Israel to exchange ''land for peace'' as a basis for compromising the present difficulties, but they don't say what America would do if Israel gave up the disputed land and got no peace. Thus, the Israelis, Palestinians and hostile Arab states that are armed by the Soviet Union are left in doubt.
This vagueness has been tolerated by both parties ever since America presided over the formation Israel, and it's doubtful that any secure settlement in the region will ever be reached until Washington convinces everybody concerned that Israel's existence within fair and defensible frontiers is really a ''vital interest.''
President-elect Bush and his chosen Secretary of State, James Baker, can begin this process by removing doubts about their intentions in the talks with the P.L.O. But to make such a policy credible, they will also have to do some talking with Democratic leaders of the Congress about a security treaty with Israel.
The new administration has a chance to make a new, more practical beginning. This means being sure that Israel's squabbling politicians really want to reconcile their differences and remove the vagueness in their relations with America.
Merely talking with Arafat about ''terrorism,'' ''peace for land'' and U.N. resolutions, without convincing him and his associates that America is ready to back the security of Israel with force, is not likely to make any fundamental change in this endless and intolerable state of semiwar.
Nor is there much future in negotiating a demilitarized Palestinian state, for a future sovereign state could make any military arrangements it liked with the Soviet Union, especially if Israel were not sure of Washington's protection.
This is not simply a formula for the security of Israel. The Mideast, with its vast oil reservoirs and location between the continents, is a ''vital'' interest not only for us but for NATO and Japan, too. And Israel is an essential base for the protection of one of the world's most important strategic areas.
At least the Bush administration, along with its other allies, should take a new look at it. Talking to Arafat alone is no answer to a crisis that will inevitably get worse as the Palestinian population increases and the divided and diminished Israelis find themselves isolated, with only promises from Washington to rely on.
