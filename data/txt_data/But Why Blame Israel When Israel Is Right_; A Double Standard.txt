To the Editor:
Your editorials (Aug. 1, 2 and 3) on the Israeli kidnapping of Sheik Obeid and the murder of Lieut. Col. William Higgins condone Israeli terrorism while rightly condemning terrorism by others. Kidnapping Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid from the territory of another country and holding him as a bargaining chip to gain the release of Israeli and other hostages from their kidnappers is using terrorist means to deal with terrorism.
Your argument that ''Israel and other nations subjected to terrorism have a right to pre-emptive and punitive action'' is an open invitation to all kinds of abuses, especially since those taking such actions determine what constitutes terrorism and who should be punished without process of any kind. Such systematic abuses continue by Israel in the occupied territories, by the Indian army in the Punjab and Sri Lanka, and by South Africa, to mention only a few.
Collective punishment of all residents and aerial bombardment of large areas on the pretext that they are terrorist bases is no less terrorist in intention and fact than sabotage of aircraft or kidnapping. You apply a moral double standard when you term Iran, Libya and Syria as states sponsoring terrorism, while failing to recognize terrorist acts by other states, including Israel. Retaliatory terrorism cannot be termed an act of self-defense by civilized democratic nations.
