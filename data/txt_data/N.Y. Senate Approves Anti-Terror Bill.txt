The state Senate approved anti-terrorism legislation yesterday that would define a new crime of bioterrorism, weaken the civil liberties of defendants accused of terrorism offenses, and increase the penalties of those convicted. One provision would allow prosecutors in terrorism cases to use evidence that was obtained illegally, if police can show that they acted in good faith. 
Civil libertarians and some Democrats opposed the legislation, and the hasty way Republican leaders brought it to a vote, but it passed 52-8. The bills were authored by Governor Pataki, a Republican, and Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, a Democrat, but majority Democrats in the Assembly have declined to take up similar legislation in the past. One of the "no" votes, Senator Eric Schneiderman of Manhattan, argued that the legislation goes too far in weakening the traditional ban on using improperly gathered evidence in court. "It's one of the pillars of liberty in our society, and it's not something that should be tampered with lightly," Mr. Schneiderman said. Democrats also complained that they had less than 24 hours to study the bills, since Governor Pataki provided a "message of necessity" cutting short the usual three-day waiting period. Mr. Pataki said he believes these new tools for fighting terrorism are urgently needed. "The threats against the people of New York are real," he said. "We have got to be proactive and do everything in our power to protect the people of New York." A spokesman for the New York Civil Liberties Union, Robert Perry, said his group opposes much of the legislation and faulted lawmakers for not giving them more scrutiny.
