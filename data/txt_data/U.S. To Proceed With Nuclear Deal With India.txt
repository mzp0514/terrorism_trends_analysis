(RTTNews) - The United States Wednesday assured India that it will proceed with the landmark Indo-U.S. nuclear deal, signed during former president George Bush&apos;s tenure, even as Washington said the two countries needed to ramp up cooperation in counter-terrorism and global issues such as climate change, media reports say.
India&apos;s Foreign Secretary Shivshankar Menon, who is on a four-day official visit to that country, received the assurance from Senior State department officials. He discussed the landmark civil nuclear deal and other bilateral issues with Under-Secretary for Political Affairs William Burns Wednesday.
"The Indo-U.S. civilian nuclear deal, its current status and the way forward too was discussed during the meeting (between Menon and Clinton)," State Department Acting Spokesman Robert Wood said. "I think there was a bit of a discussion on the additional protocol that was just worked out with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)," he added.
Monday, Menon met with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and discussed the nuclear deal, counter-terrorism cooperation, bilateral issues, and the Sri Lankan conflict besides ways to bring the situation in war-torn Afghanistan under control.
Clinton told Menon that the two countries needed to ramp up their cooperation in bilateral and global issues including climate change and counter-terrorism.
During his meetings with U.S. officials and Congressional leaders, Menon said he thanked the administration for the operational level cooperation the two countries had in the wake of last November&apos;s Mumbai strikes.
