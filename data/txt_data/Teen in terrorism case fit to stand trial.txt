Nov. 17--A judge has determined a Godfrey teen accused of acts related to terrorism is fit to stand trial.
Keaun Cook, 18, of Godfrey was charged with one count of making a terrorist threat and one count of material support for terrorism in September.
He is accused of communicating with a terrorist organization and planning an attack.
His grandmother, Debra D. Thomas, said Cook was not provided treatment for a mental illness.
In September, Judge Jennifer Hightower ordered Cook to undergo a mental evaluation to determine his fitness to stand trial, saying at the time that she had "a bona fide doubt about the Defendant's fitness for trial."
Associate Judge Phil Alfeld told attorneys this week that Cook was found to be mentally fit.
Charges were brought by Madison County State's Attorney Tom Gibbons after Gibbons said Cook "knowingly provided material support or resources with the intention that that material support or resources would be used in the support of a terrorist act by a terrorist organization."
Material support for terrorism is punishable by up to 40 years in the Illinois Department of Corrections, and making a terrorist threat is punishable up to 30 years, Gibbons said.
Cook is being held in the Madison County Jail in lieu of $150,000 bail.
