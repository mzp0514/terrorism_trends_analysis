A senior official of the former East German security police, arrested in Athens on Sunday, denied charges of complicity in murder and terrorism, a Greek official said today.
Theodore Anagnostopoulos, Greece's Minister of Public Order, said Helmut Voigt confirmed he was an ex-agent of the East German security police, known as the Stasi, but denied other charges.
Mr. Anagnostopoulos said the German was identified by Bonn as the head of Stasi's Department 22, which was responsible for counterterrorism. The department also had a small section with direct links to terrorist groups, and Mr. Voigt was said to have been responsible for it.
The minister said Mr. Voigt denied that he headed that department or that he had assisted Illich Ramirez Sanchez, the Venezuelan-born terrorist popularly known as Carlos or the Jackal, in the bombing of the French consulate in West Berlin in 1983.
Mr. Voigt is charged with supplying the terrorist with explosives for the attack. The charges against him include complicity in murder because the French consul was killed in the incident.
The minister said Mr. Voigt was charged today with entering Greece on a forged passport and would be tried Wednesday. If he is found guilty and sentenced, he would be extradited to Germany after completing his term in Greece.
