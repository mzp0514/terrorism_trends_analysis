THE bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City was a
hateful act. The nation mourns with Oklahoma City the loss of more
than a hundred people, including dozens of children _ infants, really
Following the explosion, rumors ran wild.
Muslims were said to
be behind the attack.  That was an error that arose from prejudice
.  It was deadly.
The home of a pregnant Muslim woman in Oklahoma City was stoned
.  The mother miscarried.  The child, stillborn, was buried on Monday
The family had moved to Oklahoma from Iraq to escape Saddam
Hussein's persecution of Shiite Muslims.
In London, Abraham Ahmad was taken from his plane en route to
Jordan and sent back to Oklahoma.  His only crime was being Muslim at
a time when Muslims were falsely accused of a horrific crime.
"I was treated like dirt, like a dog," Ahmad said.  "I was
judged guilty because of what I look like."
This is madness, too, like the madness behind the bombing.
Someone thought his beliefs were so correct that he had the right to
kill children.
Mobs thought they had a right to avenge those deaths by
attacking a hapless pregnant woman.
This is a time of mourning in America.  Those who use this time
to plot vengeance still do not get it. The very hate that fueled the
explosion in Oklahoma burns in their hearts.
America must let its justice system prevail.
The Department of Justice must prosecute everyone involved
criminally in the bombing in Oklahoma City.  Authorities also should
pursue those whose actions led to the stillborn death of a Muslim
baby.-30-
