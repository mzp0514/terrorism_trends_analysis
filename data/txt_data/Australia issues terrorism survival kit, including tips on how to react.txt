CANBERRA, Australia - Food and water for three days, sunscreen, a flashlight, fire extinguisher, battery-powered radio, a repair kit for the car and playing cards to keep the family amused.
Sound like a shopping list for a camping trip? It's actually a list of supplies the Australian government is advising citizens to stockpile as part of a terrorism survival kit.
The advice comes in anti-terror packets mailed this week to every home in Australia.
The packets include a refrigerator magnet with the number of a 24-hour national anti-terror hot line.
A booklet, "Let's look out for Australia," gives advice on first aid, how to react in a crisis and tips on spotting possible signs of terrorist activity including looking out for unusual videotaping or picture-taking of public buildings, suspicious vehicles, and unusual behaviors or lifestyles.
"While planning an attack, terrorists may lead lives that appear unusual or suspicious," it says.
The mailing is the second stage of a government television, radio and newspaper campaign that began in December and advises people to be "alert but not alarmed" about terrorism.
It follows a government warning last November that it had received credible information of a possible terrorist attack in Australia in coming months. Australia was already on heightened alert after the Oct. 12 bombings on the Indonesian island of Bali, which killed 88 Australians and more than 100 others.
Prime Minister John Howard wrote in a letter in the mailing that the Australian public is instrumental in the nation's ability to respond to terrorist threats.
