Four Arab students in the West Bank were wounded today when Israeli soldiers opened fire on rock-throwing youths.

TEL AVIV, July 27 - Four Arab students in the West Bank were wounded today when Israeli soldiers opened fire on rock-throwing youths.
The youths were protesting Tuesday's attack by gunmen on the Islamic college of Hebron, in which three students were slain.  Israeli officials, who described the Hebron attack as an act of terrorism, said they had no information on the identity of the gunmen.
Arab demands that militant Jewish settlers in the West Bank be disarmed were rejected today by the Israeli Chief of Staff, Lieut.  Gen. Moshe Levy. He said the settlers needed arms for their protection. Anyone using them illegally will have to be dealt with, he added.
Arab and Israeli officials reported additional rock-throwing attacks on traffic in Jenin, Kalandia, Nablus and other West Bank towns. The most sensitive localities - Hebron, Halhul and the casbah of Nablus - were under curfew.
