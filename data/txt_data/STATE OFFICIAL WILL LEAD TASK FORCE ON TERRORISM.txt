Henry Hungerbeeler, Missouri's transportation director, will lead a national task force that will assess terrorist threats to the nation's transportation system.
Hungerbeeler, a retired Air Force colonel with counterterrorism experience, will lead the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials' Task Force on Transportation Security, the Missouri Department of Transportation announced Wednesday.
The task force will review security and emergency preparedness related to bridges, tunnels and other transportation facilities critical to the nation's transportation system and national defense. It also will review current emergency response plans to coordinate them with national transportation and military plans.
"In light of the Sept. 11 tragedy, our nation's transportation system must be ready to withstand any disaster, and support our defense, our safety and our economy," said Hungerbeeler, who will take on the duties in addition to his state job.
Hungerbeeler spent 30 years in the military. He trained and led the security force that protects Air Force One.
The task force consists of representatives from Wisconsin, New Mexico, Texas, Georgia, Washington, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia, the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Department of Defense and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
