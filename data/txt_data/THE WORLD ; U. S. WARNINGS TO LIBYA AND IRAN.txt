The United States has threatened to retaliate against Iran if the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's followers in Lebanon carry out a threat to kill an American prisoner. Similarly, Libya will be held ''fully responsible,'' the Administration said, if Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's latest endorsement of terrorism is translated into action.
US warnings to Iran on threat to kill American prisoner and to Libya on Col Muammar el-Qaddafi's latest endorsements of terrorism reviewed (S)
The warning to Iran was sent after a Western news agency in Beirut received a telephoned threat in February, it was disclosed last week. The caller, who said he represented an organizatrion called the Islamic Holy War, said one of the half-dozen American hostages abducted this year in Beirut would be executed.
In 1983, when David S. Dodge of the American University in Beirut was released from a year of captivity, it was learned that he had been held in Iran for six months.
As for Libya, Colonel Qaddafi exhorted members of a new ''Pan-Arab command'' to say ''I have decided to die just to spite America.'' He called for violent action against the United States, Egypt and Sudan.
How Washington might hit back was suggested by Robert C. McFarlane, the White House national security adviser. The United States, he said recently, ''should be prepared to direct a proportional military response against bona fide military targets in a state which directs terrorist actions against us.''
