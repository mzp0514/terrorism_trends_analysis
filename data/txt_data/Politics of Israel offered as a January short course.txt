Politics of Israel is returning as a January short course next semester.
Dr. Neal Coates, chair of the department of political science and criminal justice, will offer the course for a third time. Previously the course has been offered online, however, this year the course will be offered on-campus in January.
Any student can take politics of Israel, but the course is designed for upperclassmen. The only prerequisite listed for the course is international relations. If students are interested but have not yet completed the prerequisite, they can contact Coates.
Topics of discussion throughout the course include history, connections between Judaism and Christianity, environment of people and culture, relations with Egypt and Jordan - who are both protected through a peace treaty, major wars, the growing threat of an Iranian revolution, terrorism in Israel and its growing relationships with neighboring countries.
"Israel is in interest to study because it is the only actual democracy in the Middle East," Coates said. "No where else in the Middle East is there anyone who comes close to consolidated democracy.
"Israel is the most exciting and interesting country to study in the region from how they have improved their society from how they have improved their society to how they are facing everyday terrorism."
Coates said if students are interested in religion and the Bible, business, terrorism, ancient history, world economy, innovation and entrepreneurship, they should consider taking this course.
