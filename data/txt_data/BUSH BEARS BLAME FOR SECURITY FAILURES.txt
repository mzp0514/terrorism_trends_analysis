Editor, Times-Dispatch:
For two days running - "Don't Overreact" and "No One Heard" - you tried to spread around the blame for the massive failures of intelligence, security, and preparedness that resulted in the events of 9/11.  We are told that "the Clinton administration did not do its duty," that "the citizenry cannot escape blame," and that "Bush's criticsâ€¦ spent little time from 1993 to 2001 warning that terrorists could and would strike again."
Sorry, no sale. The Hart-Rudman Commission on national security, convened in 1998, spent two-and-a-half years studying the potential threat of terrorism on U.S. soil. The bipartisan 14-member panel presented its report in January, 2001, concluding that "the combination of unconventional weapons proliferation with the persistence of international terrorism will end the relative invulnerability of the U.S. homeland to catastrophic attack." Senators Gary Hart and Warren Rudman then spent the next six months pleading with the new administration to make the issue a priority.
Instead the report and its 50 recommendations were kicked down to FEMA; the Justice Department under Attorney General John Ashcroft shifted away from anti-terrorism efforts to focus on the "war on drugs; the State Department chatted up the Taliban to that same end; and when $800 million was proposed to be moved from the Pentagon's missile-defense program into counter-terrorism, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld successfully blocked it.
This is one of those instances where the blame belongs exactly where it appears to be.
