BY ALMOST ANY reasonable measure, the federal government's terrorism insurance backstop program has been a success. The program restored confidence in the insurance marketplace after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, by helping ensure that insurance coverage would be available against future terrorist attacks, particularly in areas believed to be high-risk targets.
Given the effectiveness of the program, we're more than a little puzzled why the Obama administration's budget proposal calls for scaling it back. In fact, we can't see why the program even would be considered in a budget proposal. To date, the only costs associated with the program had been administrative; it won't pay out a cent unless the nation suffers another truly catastrophic terrorist attack, which we sincerely hope never occurs. Any savings at this point would be phantom savings.
The administration's call for eliminating coverage under the program for acts of domestic terrorism also is puzzling. Determining whether an attack stems from a wholly foreign source could be extremely difficult. Even if such a determination were easy, the fact remains that a bomb detonated by a domestic terrorist can be just as destructive as one detonated by a foreign one.
The terrorism insurance backstop has proved its worth. There's no appetite on Capitol Hill to revisit the issue until much closer to its slated 2014 expiration. For the time being, we think the administration would do better by heeding a bit of folk wisdom—``don't mess with success''—and leave the program intact.
