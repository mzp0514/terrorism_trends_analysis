WASHINGTON (AP) Whether at home or overseas, Americans should be cautious about the threat of terrorism during the holidays, President Clinton's national security adviser says.
"This is a period of heightened risk of terrorist actions involving Americans," Sandy Berger said.
"I would say Americans should be vigilant as they go about their plans for the New Year's."
Berger said on CBS' "Face the Nation" on Sunday that authorities were still trying to find out whether an Algerian arrested for allegedly bringing bomb-making explosives into Washington state last week was part of a terrorist network.
"We're not aware of any other specific threat against particular targets in the United States," Berger said. "Obviously, if that changes we'll alert the American people."
Still, Berger said people should report suspicious packages or activities to the police and take extra care when traveling.
The State Department previously issued a terrorism alert for U.S. travelers.
As well, Customs officials say security was tightened along U.S. borders after the arrest of Ahmed Ressam. Police say he had bomb material in the trunk of a rented car on a ferry he took to Port Angeles, Wash., from Victoria, British Columbia.
On other topics, Berger said Baghdad's rejection of a U.N. plan to resume weapons inspections would help solidify support for sanctions against Iraq and he expressed optimism about the prospects for peace between Syria and Israel.
