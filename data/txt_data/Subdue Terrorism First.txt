To the Editor:
I say to good intentioned but mistaken anti-war protestors, best we protest this war by fighting for a better peace.
The killing of 6,000 innocent people in New York City and Washington DC was not a one-time act of vandalism. Those who set loose this attack intend to continue their war against us until they have destroyed our liberty and the civilization that gives us shelter. If unchecked, they will sneak nuclear bombs into our cities, seed with virulent germs and toxins the food in our markets, and poison with deadly chemicals our air, land and water. Our nation and the free peoples of this world are in a fight for survival.
To win this war and a lasting peace we must subdue two enemies -- terrorism and the injustice that fuels terrorism. To do so, it will take a determined and worldwide effort by all peoples who value peace over war and justice over greed. Thus, our struggle must be to achieve more than victory over a terrorist enemy. Assuming that the protestors of this war do not suffer from a martyr complex and that they care deeply about the fate of humanity, they might consider that they do the cause of peace-with-justice more harm than good. This nation is not going to appease Osama bin Laden and his fanatical allies. To do so would be to make the same mistake that enabled Adolf Hitler and his totalitarian allies to brutalize the people of this good earth.
