Therapists who treat childhood trauma said parents wishing to talk to their children about the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., should address the news directly and soon, allowing the child to lead with questions.
First, find out what they have heard. Listen to their fears. Dispel rumors. And be honest, sharing as much detail as a child is able to handle.
''There's a lot of talk on Facebook and Twitter, and it's important to clarify what's rumor and what's not,'' said Melissa Brymer, director of terrorism and disaster programs at the National Center for Child Traumatic Stress, based at the University of California, Los Angeles, and Duke University. Dr. Andrew J. Gerber, a child psychiatrist at Columbia, said parents should come to terms with their own feelings first. They should ''metabolize the awfulness of the event so that what they pass on when they have a discussion with their children conveys a certain amount of thoughtfulness and understanding, rather than raw trauma,'' he said in an e-mail.
If children are frightened, determine the source of the fear. It may be a worry that their classroom is not safe; or about how to escape school when under threat. ''Ask what their worst fear is, and address that,'' said Dr. Robert H. Abramovitz, a child psychiatrist at Hunter College.
If possible, other therapists said, parents should use family or holiday routines as a comforting structure. Spend extra time with children at bedtime. Engage traditions that remind them what they are thankful for. And remind them of something important: that the world is a good place, even if some people do very bad things.
