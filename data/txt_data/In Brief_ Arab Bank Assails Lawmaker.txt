Arab Bank PLC said "gutter politics" motivated a New York congressman to
introduce legislation that would close its Manhattan branch.
Rep. Anthony Weiner, a Democrat representing Brooklyn and Queens, and
three other Democrats announced a bill Wednesday that would also seize the
branch's assets on behalf of terrorism victims who have sued the bank. The
bill would also require the Treasury Department to issue a public report on
its investigation of Arab Bank.
Rep. Weiner said the bank has ties to terrorists and has "no business
being in business in the United States, and certainly not in New York City."
The bank said in a statement issued through a spokesman that Rep.
Weiner's actions were "deplorable" and "designed to promote his last-place
mayoral campaign by attacking a respectable Arab institution." The bank said
that it is "strongly committed to preventing the financing of terrorism," and
that the bill uses "terrorism to mask blatant discriminatory action against a 
bank and a people based on race."
In February, Arab Bank consented to an order by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency that required it to cease all wire transfers and
wind up banking operations other than trade financing. The OCC said at the 
time that the bank had failed to monitor suspicious transactions.
