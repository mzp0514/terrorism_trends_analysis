Your chronology ''Selected Turns in Israeli-PLO Conflict,'' July
1, distorts and omits several key incidents.
Most egregious is the omission of incidents of PLO terrorism
against Israeli civilians that formed the core and defined the
course of Israeli-PLO relations.
The PLO's current political
approach does not erase 25 years of violence and bloodshed. Also
missing is the 1964 PLO charter, which called for the destruction
of Israel, and PLO support for Iraq's 1989 invasion of Kuwait.
Finally, Israel's invasion of Lebanon in June 1982 did not
scuttle the rest of the Camp David accords. From the beginning, the
Palestinians had consistently rejected the autonomy arrangements
envisioned in the accords. Today's welcome progress in Israel-PLO
relations should not serve as a pretense for rewriting history.
