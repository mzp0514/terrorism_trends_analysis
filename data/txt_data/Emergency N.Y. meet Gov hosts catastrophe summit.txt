ALBANY-State officials are going international in an effort to school New York's emergency service personnel on handling catastrophes like terrorism, massacres and hurricanes.
Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair is among more than a dozen terrorism experts and emergency service officials from around the globe who will take part in an emergency preparedness summit being hosted by Gov. Cuomo in October.
Also on tap will be the veterans who managed the aftermath of mass shootings in Norway and Auorora, Colo..
"We are doing a whole new focus on emergency response in this state," said Jerome Hauer, commissioner of the state's Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services.
State officials expect thousands of cops, firefighters and emergency management officials from around the state to attend the Albany gathering.
Hauer said the state is putting a greater focus on preparing for catastrophic incidents such as Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee, which struck New York last year.
The two storms, which struck within a week of each other last year, caused $1.5 billion in damage, Cuomo administration officials revealed yesterday.
Emergency service officials from Joplin, Mo., which was ravaged by tornadoes last year, are also among those expected to attend the state's preparedness summit.gblain@nydailynews.com
