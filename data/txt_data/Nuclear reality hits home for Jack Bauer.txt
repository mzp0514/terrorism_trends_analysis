For "24" fans, Monday night's ending was quite a shock, and not in the way they're accustomed to.
The episode concluded with Jack Bauer failing to stop terrorists from detonating a "suitcase nuke" in the Los Angeles suburb of Valencia, with casualties estimated in the hundreds of thousands.
Seeing a mushroom cloud over suburban homes is shocking, and some viewers may cry foul about questionable taste. The Daily Bruin Editorial Board, however, doesn't.
Plotlines on "24" are typically implausible, reaching an apex with last season's Oval Office conspiracy. This, coupled with Bauer's seeming invincibility, lulled viewers into a false sense of security: No matter the situation, Jack would prevail.
His failure, however, brings reality to the series and viewers' lives. Not only is Jack not invincible, but we aren't either. Nuclear terrorism is a bogeyman that we are terrified to seriously consider. So much is made of worrying about repeat attacks (shoe bombs, gel bombs, hijacked planes) that we turn a blind eye to new ones. After all, former Soviet National Security Adviser Alexander Lebed claimed on "60 Minutes" in 1997 that the Russian government didn't know the whereabouts of nearly 100 suitcase nukes similar to those on "24."
For many who refuse to be depressed by the news, shows like "24" may be the most exposure they get to world affairs. A ludicrous notion? Maybe.
But if an adrenaline-filled action series is the only medium willing to confront nuclear terrorism, then so be it.
