Too Real: To a certain kind of thriller writer, current events are catnip. Take Daniel Silva, whose novel ''The Black Widow'' enters the hardcover fiction list at No.â€¯1. You and I might be duly terrorized by terrorism, but Silva -- whose series hero is the art restorer and Israeli spy Gabriel Allon -- is tantalized. So ''The Black Widow'' opens with ISIS bombings in Paris and Amsterdam that inevitably call to mind actual attacks carried out since last fall in France and northern Europe. Yet any similarities, Silva notes in a foreword, are coincidental. ''I commenced work on this novel before the Islamic terrorist group known as ISIS carried out a wave of shootings and bombings in Paris and Brussels that left more than 160 people dead,'' he writes. ''After briefly considering setting aside the typescript, I chose to complete it as originally conceived. .â€ˆ.â€ˆ. I take no pride in my prescience. I only wish that the murderous, millenarian terrorism of the Islamic State lived solely on the pages of this story.''
Silva has criticized the Western response to ISIS -- ''I wrote this book as a warning about what was coming,'' he told The Dallas Morning News this month -- but he has no complaints about the response to his series. ''I .â€ˆ.â€ˆ. got to throw a first pitch at Yankee Stadium,'' he said in the same interview. ''Never would have happened without Gabriel Allon. I'm proud to say, by the way, that I threw it from the top of the mound and didn't bounce it. You can't bounce it in Yankee Stadium, because they'll boo you there.''
