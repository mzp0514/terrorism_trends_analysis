No, terrorists have not descended upon the village of Cross Plains today.
Dane County is conducting a full-scale terrorism exercise to test its emergency management "mass casualty plan."
The mock incident involves multiple volunteer "victims" and on-site emergency decontamination of them.
The exercise, paid for through federal grants, will be held from 9 a.m. to noon in the village of Cross Plains, west of Madison, near Bourbon Road and Highway P.
Ray Pena of the Dane County Emergency Management Department said about 20 people will act as if they've been involved in an explosion involving a hazardous chemical.
"The exercise takes it through rescue, decontamination and mass casualty response, and then transport," Pena said.
Today's event completes a series of three exercises that started in June and continued in August, testing the county's and first responders' procedures in dealing with terrorism and natural disasters.
Dane County had been preparing for terrorism or mass casualty events even before the Sept. 11 terrorism attacks.
"These three exercises are based on a terrorism scenario, but what we learn from them applies to other kinds of emergencies, especially those involving hazardous chemicals," said Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk.
