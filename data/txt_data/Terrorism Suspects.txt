To the Editor:
''Politics Over Principle'' (editorial, Dec. 16) says measures in the defense bill that Congress just passed ''will strip the F.B.I., federal prosecutors and federal courts of all or most of their power to arrest and prosecute terrorists and hand it off to the military.''
Nothing in the bill authorizes the military to arrest anyone on American soil; it provides for military detention (subject to a waiver) only for foreign members of Al Qaeda who have already been captured. The bill includes specific language ensuring that it does not ''expand the authority of the President or the scope of the Authorization for Use of Military Force'' or ''affect the existing criminal enforcement and national security authorities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation or any other domestic law enforcement agency.''
You state that the bill ''allows the executive to grant a waiver for a particular prisoner to be brought to trial in a civilian court.'' In fact, the relevant waiver provision deals with detention, not civilian trials, which are specifically authorized in the bill with no requirement for a waiver.
You say the bill includes a ''ban on spending any money for civilian trials for any accused terrorist,'' a ban you argue ''would make that waiver largely meaningless.'' The bill continues an existing prohibition on transferring one small group of detainees -- those held at Guantanamo -- to the United States. That has no application to any other detainees, for whom civilian trial is expressly authorized in the bill.
