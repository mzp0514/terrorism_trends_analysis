Omoyele Sowore BEVERLY HILLS, September 16, (THEWILL) The leader of the #RevolutionNow protest, Omoyele Sowore, has again asked the Federal High Court to grant him bail on self recognisance or any condition the court chooses. Mr Sowore's request is contained in a motion filed on Friday by his counsel, Femi Falana, from section 28(4) of the Terrorism Prevention (Amendment) Act 2013, which states that a person detained pursuant to Section 27 (1) can be admitted to bail by the court.
 THEWILL recalls that Justice Nkeonye Maha on August 28 refused to hear an earlier application filed by Sowore, challenging his detention for 45 days by the State Security Service (SSS), and sent the case back to Justice Taiwo Taiwo, the judge who granted the SSS the authorisation to detain him for 45 days. Sowore was arrested by the SSS after he planned a nationwide protest tagged #RevolutionNow as he was accused of terrorism and plotting to overthrow President Muhammadu Buhari which he denied.
 Prior to his arrest, he met with a fugitive separatist leader, Nnamdi Kanu, abroad, and posted photos of the meeting. Mr Kanu, who is being tried for treason in Nigeria, jumped bail and travelled abroad.
 The meeting is one of the 'evidence' the government is using to accuse Mr Sowore of terrorism. "The applicant herein is seeking the order of the court admitting the applicant to bail on self-recognition or upon any condition the court may reasonably deem to impose in the circumstances of the case," his new motion says.
