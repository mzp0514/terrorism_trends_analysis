Paris suffered a horrific tragedy on Friday when over 120 people died and 350 people were injured in a terrorist attack. France is unfortunately not alone is dealing with major acts of terrorism this year.
The day before the Paris terrorist attack, a bomb killed 43 in Beirut, Lebanon. In Kenya, 147 people, mostly students, were killed in an act of terror in April.
The world has become increasingly globalized, and terror is a global problem that affects the entire world. While it can be easy to compartmentalize terror as something that happens in other places, the Paris attacks and the recent ISIS threats against Washington D.C. should make it clear that terror is a force that affects us all.
The slogan that has arisen after the Paris terror attacks is "solidarité." It represents the idea that we must all stand together to prevent terrorism. We as an editorial staff believe that terrorism is a dangerous threat that affects us all, and we must stand in solidarity with all countries, no matter where, that are working to combat terrorism.
Solidarity does not simply mean changing your Facebook background to the French flag. There is nothing wrong with doing so, but it cannot be the extent of our efforts.
Everyone has the ability to fight terror by making a focused effort to fight for the ideals that terrorists are attempting to take away. All citizens have a vote with which they can advocate for leaders who will stand up to terrorism, while refusing to discriminate against innocent people, no matter the party. Solidarité cannot merely be a trend, but must represent a concentrated effort to put an end to terrorism and fight back against ideology that fosters it.
