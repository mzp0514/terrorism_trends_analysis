WASHINGTON - Congressional negotiators completed work Thursday on a $ 100 billion terrorism insurance package that lawmakers hope will stimulate the economy and help cover the costs of insurance against future terrorist attacks.
House and Senate leaders have yet to officially sign off on the language, but "we believe we've got an agreement," said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., one of the chief Senate negotiators.
"We obviously depend upon other people signing on it to confirm it. I think that's going to happen."
Added House Financial Services Committee Chairman Michael Oxley, R-Ohio: "As in any conference agreement, everyone must compromise and that is what we have done here.
"The U.S. economy must come before our individual preferences in the legislation, and today we have put the nation's workers first."
Lawmakers said they would release details of the agreement later.
President Bush and the GOP have pushed strongly for the legislation, saying as much as $ 15 billion in construction and real estate transactions and 300,000 jobs are on hold because Congress has not passed a bill.
"We are very pleased with the progress that has been made in the last couple of days toward reaching an agreement," said White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan.
"The parties are very close and the main elements of a deal are falling into place. We do not have a deal, but we are very encouraged."
House members have left the Capitol to campaign for re-election. House leadership aides said they had not decided whether to bring lawmakers back before Election Day to consider a final agreement.
