NEW YORK (AP) - Sen. Charles Schumer is calling for a review of the federal response to the recent outbreak of West Nile-like virus and says the U.S. government should appoint a terrorism czar.
Although the CIA concluded the outbreak was not the work of terrorists, Schumer asserted in a letter to the U.S. General Accounting Office that the outbreak provides an opportunity to assess the federal government's ability to respond to a potentially catastrophic biological attack.
"I don't want to be alarmist, but we must be as prepared as possible," Schumer said Sunday.
He said the outbreak revealed troubling gaps in emergency preparedness for a biological attack and called the outbreak the closest example yet of what such a terrorist assault on the United States might resemble.
The mosquito-borne virus was first detected in early September. It was the first time that particular strain of encephalitis virus was found in the United States.
It has killed six people and infected 55 others in the metropolitan area and has been detected in numerous birds.
Schumer said he planned to ask President Clinton to appoint a high-level domestic terrorism official to coordinate and evaluate federal response to terrorist acts.
