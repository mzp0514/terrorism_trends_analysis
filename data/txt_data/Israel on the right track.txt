Days after Israel's Cabinet overwhelmingly voted to pass a peace agreement with the Palestinians, stories of terrorism have burst onto newscasts everywhere, soiling optimism and diverting attention from one of the few stories in the world that is inching toward a quasi-peaceful ending.
From a purely American perspective, the most sensible route of action is to bring the terrorists to justice and send a harsh warning to those who wish to emulate them.
Boston U.But the politics of terrorism are not the same in the Middle East and only a fool could say American ideologies apply.
In a world that is being rocked by horrific stories of riots in East Timor, bombings in Kashmir and guerilla warfare in the Russian republic of Chechnya, Israel should be an example of a country that has consistently made the effort to go to the bargaining table.
Yes, it is true that the overused, yet perfect, adjective for this conflict is age-old. Palestinians and Israelis have been fighting for years and the hatred still is evident in literally every neighborhood. But it is also true that resolving major conflicts takes legislation, leadership, legions of citizens willing to shatter misconceptions and, most importantly, time. Israelis do have legislation in the peace accord, leadership in Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and a public that wants peace, but they do still need time. Time to learn to live with people they have been raised to hate, time to accept the new geography of the Middle East and time to muffle out the constant threat of terrorism.
