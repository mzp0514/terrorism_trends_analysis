National Catholic Reporter, editorial: "The Holy Father needs to directly answer questions, in a credible forum, about his role -- as archbishop of Munich (1977-82), as prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (1982-2005) and as pope (2005-present) -- in the mismanagement of the clergy sex abuse crisis. ... A story that began with reports on trials in a few U.S. cities a quarter-century back has now moved up the Catholic institutional ladder. ... We now face the largest institutional crisis in centuries, possibly in church history. How this crisis is handled by Pope Benedict XVI ... will likely determine the future health of our church for decades, if not centuries, to come.
David Lamb, article, Smithsonian: "The world's most populous Muslim country, with 240 million people, Indonesia ... (has) become what Freedom House, a U.S. think tank, called the only fully free and democratic country in Southeast Asia. ... Arrests, executions and raids (have) seriously weakened Jemaah Islamiyah, a homegrown al-Qaeda look-alike considered Southeast Asia's deadliest terrorist group. ... 'Indonesia has done far better than the United States combating terrorism as far as abiding by the rule of law goes,' said Sidney Jones, a longtime U.S. resident of Jakarta and a conflict analyst with the Belgium-based International Crisis Group. 'There have been no witch hunts, no Guantanamos, no waterboarding.' The Yudhoyono government, she said, treats terrorism as a law-and-order problem for the police."
