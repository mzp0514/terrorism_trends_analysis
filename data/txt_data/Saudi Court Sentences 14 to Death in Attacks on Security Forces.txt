RIYADH -- A court in Saudi Arabia sentenced 14 men to death on Wednesday in connection with attacks on security forces in a Shiite area in the country's east, the Al Arabiya satellite network reported.
Of the 24 people tried, one was acquitted and nine others were given sentences ranging from three to 15 years, the network said. Those sentenced to death were accused of terrorism. 
  The men were arrested a few years ago, when protests by members of Saudi Arabia's Shiite minority roiled the Qatif area of Eastern Province, leading to clashes with the security forces that left dead about 20 protesters and a number of police officers.
  Many Shiites complain of discrimination in the Sunni-majority kingdom whose official creed considers some Shiite beliefs and practices heretical.
  The Saudi government characterized the protesters as rioters who harbored armed groups, and it has put some of them on trial on charges that include terrorism. Western human rights groups have accused the Saudi government of using the courts to stifle dissent and convicting activists on trumped up charges.
  The executions could escalate tensions with Saudi Arabia's regional Shiite rival, Iran. Saudi Arabia's execution of an outspoken Shiite cleric in January sparked protests in Tehran, and Saudi Arabia cut diplomatic ties after protesters stormed its embassy.
  The men's death sentences can be appealed.
