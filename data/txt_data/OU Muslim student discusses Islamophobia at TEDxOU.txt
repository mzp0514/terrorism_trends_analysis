An OU student presenting at TEDxOU spoke out about how both Muslims and non-Muslims can work to solve Islamophobia in the wake of terrorism.
Zainab Shakir, a microbiology senior, discussed the issues that lie behind people's reactions to terrorist acts and what can be done to diminish harmful prejudice.
Shakir recounted her experience as a Muslim and what she and others have gone through since the attack on New York City's World Trade Center in 2001.
"My friends have told me horror stories," Shakir said.
She emphasized how airport security has often held her back for screening, one of several kinds of discrimination she has witnessed.
She said because of how they are perceived and treated, Muslims often hope that whenever news of a possible terrorist attack surfaces the perpetrator is not another Muslim.
Shakir said although non-Muslims need to try to understand the roots of terrorism, Muslims also have their own faults reacting to attacks.
"I want to tell these deluded keyboard Muslim warriors get your head out of the sand," Shakir said, referring the claim that ISIS terrorists aren't really Muslim she said has become common on social media.
Shakir said the Islamic declaration of faith is evidence even "bad Muslims" are still Muslim, despite their actions.
She concluded her talk by saying that the key to solving the problem of Islamophobia is through attempting to understand what causes individuals to commit acts of terrorism, instead of blaming an entire religion.
"Judge people by their actions and not on their faith," Shakir said.
