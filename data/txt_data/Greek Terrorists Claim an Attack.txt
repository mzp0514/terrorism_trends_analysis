A Greek terrorist group has claimed responsibility for opening fire on a private television network in Athens last week, vowing additional attacks against journalists, the police said Saturday.
  The attack was the second this month by the far-left group Sect of Rebels and the latest in a wave of attacks that has gripped the nation since violent riots in December and revived fears of domestic terrorism here after several years of relative stability.
  In the attack on Wednesday, a makeshift grenade was thrown and 14 bullets were fired at the Athens headquarters of the Alter TV network. The group also attacked an Athens police station on Feb. 3. No one was injured in either episode.
  In a statement on Friday, the Sect of Rebels said it intended to expand its campaign. ''We are sending an ultimatum to all journalists,'' it  said. ''The period in which you were target-free is over.'' It condemned journalists as ''colluding with the corrupt establishment.''
  Riots shook Greece in December after the police shooting of a 15-year-old boy in Athens. Youths in several cities caused some $1.3 billion in damage. 
  In the last month, militant groups have carried out more than 20 attacks. Homegrown terrorism had largely waned since the authorities dismantled Greece's deadliest groups  before the 2004 Olympics in Athens.
