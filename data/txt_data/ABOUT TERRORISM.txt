Dr. Safdar I. Chaudhary, president of the Greater Pittsburgh Islamic Council, was perhaps uninformed when he wrote in his Sept. 15 letter ("Muslims As a Whole Are Not to Blame For the Acts of a Few") that worldwide bombings by Muslims and/or Arabs are "not glorified by any Muslim government or responsible political force."
On April 2, Faisal Husseini, Cabinet minister in the Palestinian Authority, delivered the eulogy for senior Hamas bombmaker Muhi a-Din a-Sharif.
On Nov. 23, 1997, Arafat's official newspaper, Al Hayat Al Jadidah, extolled the Arab terrorist who blew up 241 Americans in Beirut in 1983. On Oct. 29, 1996, Hani al-Hasan, a senior adviser to Arafat praised the leader of the terrorist group Islamic Jihad as "a giant among giants of the Palestinian people, one of the giants of the nation" and "the teacher of generations." Recall that Islamic Jihad is responsible for numerous bus bombings that have killed dozens and maimed hundreds.
Chaudhary's comments about political pluralism in Israel were equally inaccurate.  Israeli Arabs, as well as all of Israel's numerous minority groups have the right to vote and are represented in the Knesset, Israel's parliament. In fact, because Israel's Jews are almost evenly divided between the two major parties, the Arab voters are seen as the tie-breakers and are strenuously courted by politicians.
Dr. Chaudhary and others who hope to erase hateful and untrue stereotypes about Muslims would be more successful in reaching this important goal if they spent more time condemning terrorists and less time blaming the victims.
