ATHENS, Greece (AP) - An appeals council has granted Italy's request to extradite a Palestinian convicted in absentia and sentenced to life in prison in the hijacking in 1985 of the Achille Lauro.  But the man has at least two remaining avenues of appeal, and he could also be held for trial on Greek charges.
The three-member panel, a special judicial body that deals with extraditions, ruled Tuesday in favor of Italy's extradition request for Abdulrahim Khaled.  Khaled, 56, has 24 hours to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. Even if the Supreme Court denies an appeal, the final decision on extradition rests with the Ministry of Justice.  Khaled also faces Greek charges of terrorism and attempted jailbreak. If convicted, he may have to serve time in Greece before being extradited.  The appeals council rejected Khaled's claim that he is an Iraqi citizen with the same name as the Palestinian convicted of helping to plan the hijacking of the Achille Lauro, a luxury liner.  The man held in Greece claimed he is Yossif Hoou Khaled. He said he is 57 and owns a garage in Iraq.  In its decision, the appeals council said the Italian request contained material proving the man's identity beyond a reasonable doubt.  According to the Italians, Khaled, a Yemini citizen, is a ranking official in Abu Abbas' Palestinian Liberation Front. He was convicted by an Italian court in 1987 of helping to plan the Achille Lauro hijacking. Leon Klinghoffer, an American Jew from New York, was killed by the hijackers.  Khaled was arrested in Athens two months ago in an apartment containing explosives. He was charged with terrorism.
