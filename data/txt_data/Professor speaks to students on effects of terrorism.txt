University of Missouri professor of political science Paul Wallace told a group of students and community members Wednesday night he does not believe Osama bin Laden is in Afghanistan but that he is living elsewhere in disguise.
In addition, Wallace said he believes the Taliban involvement in Afghanistan has increasingly dangerous consequences.

"The longer this goes on with the Taliban, the more serious the situation gets," said Wallace, a specialist on terrorism and South Asia. "The two sides need to get together without U.S. involvement."
SANGAM, the University of Missouri South Asian Students Association, sponsored the lecture and discussion.
Other topics discussed included Taliban intervention in Afghanistan, effects on surrounding countries, the effects of U.S attacks and possibilities for a resolution to conflicts in India.
Anamika Pandya, vice president of SANGAM, said she mostly agreed with Wallace's views but she said she had her own opinion on the U.S. response to the acts of terrorism.
"I think we took the right action, but I think it would have been more right if we would of waited a little longer to see if any peace talks opened up," Pandya said.
Junior Nishi Gupta said she has been affected by U.S. retaliation to terrorist attacks.
"I think we're doing what we have to do," she said. "There's going to be civilian casualties; that's just a result of war. I know some people who wanted to go to Southeast Asia, and now they're not."
Wallace ended the discussion with an optimistic note.
"Everything is possible in politics," he said. "Politics can create the problems, but only politics can resolve the problems."
