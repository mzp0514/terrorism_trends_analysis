Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva asked rich countries on Friday to make tough compromises in long-struggling global free trade talks, or risk continued terrorism, organized crime and other ills caused by diminished hope in the world's poorest countries.
Silva said it was up to the United States and Europe to tear down the barriers to farm trade that poor countries say are preventing them from developing their economies.
"If we wish to send a signal to the poorest countries on the planet that they will have an opportunity in the 21st century, it is necessary that the United States, Britain, France and Germany, that these countries should assume responsibility," he said. "If we want to avoid terrorism in the world and growth in organized crime, I believe that the Doha round is one of the paths that we should follow."
Trade talks in Doha, Qatar, have stumbled over clashes between rich and poor countries on slashing subsidies and tariffs, particularly for farm goods.
Silva's address came one day before top trade negotiators from Brazil, the U.S., the 27-nation European Union and two dozen other countries are scheduled to meet at the World Economic Forum in an attempt to find a way forward in the talks.
Negotiators are trying to reach an agreement before July, when President George W. Bush's authority to make trade deals that can be sent to Congress for a simple yes-or-no vote expires.
