Israeli officials were disappointed Friday that the first visit by a U.S. president to Syria in 20 years did not do more to advance peace.
Officials had expected Syria's President Hafez Assad to propose something more substantial to Bill Clinton when the president was in Damascus Thursday.
Government spokesman Uri Dromi said that Assad had said little new, despite Clinton's assertion at a news conference in Jerusalem Thursday that in private conversations, Assad "went beyond anything he said before" on making peace with Israel.
In a telephone interview Friday, Dromi said that Israel has "already heard all those things he (Assad) said."
Officials also were disappointed that Assad did not publicly condemn terrorism against Israel, although Clinton said Assad privately had denounced the bus bombing Oct. 19 in Tel Aviv that killed 23 people.
"We did not hear any explicit words from Assad" about his vision of peace, Dromi said.
Even Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who appeared willing Thursday to give Clinton and Assad the benefit of the doubt, sounded dejected in an interview with the Yedioth Ahronoth, a daily newspaper.
"I am not sure what Syria sees in peace, I am not sure when they are prepared to make normalization with us, if at all," Rabin said.
Yedioth Ahronoth said Clinton had failed to get Assad to agree to meet with Rabin or to raise the talks from the ambassadorial level to the foreign minister level.
