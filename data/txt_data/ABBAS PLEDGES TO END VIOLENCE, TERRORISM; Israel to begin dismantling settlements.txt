AQABA, Jordan - Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas vowed Wednesday to end the armed uprising against Israel in exchange for Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's most explicit endorsement to date of Palestinian statehood.
At a landmark summit here, Abbas pledged "a complete end to violence and terrorism" and Sharon promised to begin "immediately" to dismantle some of the Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza that Palestinians regard as their homeland.
President Bush, who brought Abbas and Sharon together for talks aimed at restoring a peace process after 32 months of renewed bloodshed between Israelis and Palestinians, said Wednesday's Red Sea summit had set both parties on the path toward peace.
"All here today now share a goal," Bush said. "The Holy Land must be shared between the state of Palestine and the state of Israel, living at peace with each other and with every nation of the Middle East."
Later, en route from to Doha, Qatar, where he is to meet today with U.S. forces supporting operations in nearby Iraq, Bush said he told the parties he would remain personally engaged in the peace process.
"I used the expression 'ride herd,' " Bush told reporters traveling with him aboard Air Force One. "I don't know if anybody understood it in the meeting today."
The meeting, Bush said, had yielded the "first signs of peace."
"It's progress," Bush said. "These first signs of peace happen when people make up their minds to work toward peace, and that's what you saw."
