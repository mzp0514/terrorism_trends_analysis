A federal judge said Friday he was "distressed" by Attorney General John Ashcroft's public praise of a key government witness at the trial of four men on suspicion of terrorism.
Defense attorneys criticized the attorney general's remarks, and U.S. Di strict Judge Gerald Rosen said he will take up the issue after the trial.
The participants are under a gag order.
At a news conference Thursday in Washington, Ashcroft called witness Youssef Hmimssa's cooperation "a critical tool" in efforts to combat t errorism. He said it should put potential terrorists on notice that there are informers among them. "His testimony has been of value, substantial value."
Defense lawyers argued that the remarks were at least the second time Ashcroft had violated the judge's gag order. The judge said he would decide after the trial whether to consider a defense request to have Ashcroft explain his actions. "I was distressed to see the attorney general commenting in the middle of a trial about the credibility of a witness who had just gotten off the stand," Rosen said.
Justice Department spokeswoman Barbara Comstock said Ashcroft made the comments during a news conference and "certainly had no intent to contravene the judge's wishes regarding publicity."
