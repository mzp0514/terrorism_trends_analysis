WASHINGTON - With Republicans attacking his wife Hillary, Bill Clinton was urged by a strategist in 1996 to "defend the honor of the First Lady" because Democrats were too wimpy to do it for him.
Paul Begala made the recommendation to White House adviser Donald Baer, as Clinton prepared for his 1996 State of the Union Address, according to a memo released Friday.
"The Republicans are attacking her without compunction, in part because they know the Democrats are too chickens--t to retaliate," Begala wrote. "So it's left to the President."
In the address, Bill Clinton called Hillary Clinton "a wonderful wife, a magnificent mother and a great First Lady." It was not clear if Begala had wanted a stronger defense.
The memo was among 4,000 pages of documents from the Clinton administration that were made public Friday - the second such trove released in recent weeks.
An unsigned, handwritten note included among documents on combatting terrorism urged, "Send a Muslim!"
The undated memo did not say where the person would be sent.
But it said a Muslim would help the administration focus on the real issue - terrorism - and not a perceived war between the U.S. and Muslims. It said the State Department should find a prominent Muslim for the task.
