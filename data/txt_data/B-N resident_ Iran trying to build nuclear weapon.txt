NORMAL - The Iranian government supports terrorism and is attempting to build a nuclear weapon, said a native Iranian living in the United States. 
"Absolutely they support terrorism and they are trying to cover up a weapons program. Enriching uranium for nuclear power is a secondary concern," said Daryoush "Dave" Ghashghai of Bloomington, who has lived in the United States for about 30 years and moved to the Twin Cities five years ago. 
He declined to speculate on how close Iran is to a nuclear weapon, but said, "they are a lot closer than anyone thinks." 
Ghashghai, who works with computers at State Farm Insurance Cos., said he’s speaking out because "it has to be said." He has relatives in Iran, but doubts he’ll ever return. 
Jamal Nassar chairman of the Department of Politics and Government at Illinois State University, admires Ghashghai’s courage in speaking out, but doesn’t necessarily agree with his assessment. Nassar said he can’t rule out Iran building a nuclear weapon, but "it’s hard to tell." 
Ghashghai said most Iranians want better relations with the U.S., but they have little control over their government. 
Young Iranians, Nassar acknowledged, identify with American culture, specifically with American music. These young Iranians, he said, differentiate between American culture and U.S. government policies.
