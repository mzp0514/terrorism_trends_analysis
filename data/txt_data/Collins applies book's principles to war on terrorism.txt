Asked how Good to Great might apply to the terrorist situation, Jim Collins wrote the following for USA TODAY:
 * Mr. Bush will need to rise to Level 5 leadership. This means being ambitious first and foremost for the long-term interest of the nation, not the interests of the party or his own political goals. It also means having the personal humility to say, "I don't know all the answers," combined with the will to do whatever it takes -- however long it takes -- to produce the best long-term results. The model here is Lincoln, not Patton.
* The critical first step is not to figure out "what" to do, but to figure out who are the best people in the world to throw at the problem. One of Bush's primary strengths is his focus on getting the right people around him.
 * On the one hand, we need to retain absolute unwavering faith that we will prevail in the end, while on the other hand retaining the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of reality, whatever they might be. As Adm. Jim Stockdale taught about his survival as a prisoner of war, the key is to know that you will get out but know you're not going to be out by Christmas. It is leadership's responsibility to help people see that we have many brutal facts to confront -- we will not be done by Christmas, nor even the next Christmas -- but to also see that we can (and will) win the long struggle.
 * The best results come when you tap the passions of your people, when you build off of what you can do better than any other entity in the world, and when you build a strong economic engine. Fortunately, America is well-endowed on all three dimensions.
 * The most resilient institutions blend freedom and entrepreneurship with discipline and responsibility. The magic of America at its best is the ability to blend these two contradictory elements into a culture where people ask not "what is my job?" but "what is my responsibility?" We became an entrepreneurial culture in the 1990s, but we lost our discipline. Now, we need both.
 * Technology can be a powerful adjunct to well-thought plans. But we should not be lulled into thinking that our technological sophistication alone can bring victory, as we learned all too well in Vietnam.
 * Going from good to great in any endeavor is like pushing a huge, heavy flywheel, one turn upon another. At first, it takes a huge amount of effort to just go one or two turns. But with persistent effort, you eventually hit a point of breakthrough results. We need the patience to build momentum in the war on terrorism and to not fall into a doom loop of frantically searching for a quick fix.
 * The signature of enduring greatness is the ability to remain true to one's core values during times of great difficulty. If we abandon our national core values for the sake of security or expedience, we will begin to erode our greatness as a nation -- and then they will have won.
