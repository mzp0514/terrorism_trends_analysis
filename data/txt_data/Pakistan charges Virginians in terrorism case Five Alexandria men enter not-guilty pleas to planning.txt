 ISLAMABAD - A Pakistani court charged five young Americans yesterday with planning terrorist attacks in the South Asian country and conspiring to wage war against nations allied with Pakistan, their defense lawyer said.
 The men - all Muslims from Alexandria who all are in their late teens or early 20s - pleaded not guilty to a total of five charges, the most severe of which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison, defense lawyer Hasan Dastagir said.
 The men were charged by an anti-terrorism court inside a prison in Sargodha, the city in Punjab province where they were arrested in December. They were reported missing by their families in November after one left behind a farewell video that shows scenes of war and casualties and says Muslims must be defended.
 Their lawyer has said they were heading to Afghanistan and had no plans to stage attacks in Pakistan.
 The trial will begin March 31, Dastagir said.
 The men have been identified as Ramy Zamzam, Waqar Khan, Umar Farooq, Aman Hassan Yemer, and Ahmed Minni.
 The men alleged in a note passed to reporters at an earlier hearing that they had been tortured while in Pakistani custody, with the complicity of American intelligence agents.
 Khalid Khawaja, a former Pakistani intelligence agent turned human-rights activist who has championed the cause of the men, also asserted that they had been "tortured and had false cases registered against them."
 Pakistan and the U.S. have denied those allegations.
