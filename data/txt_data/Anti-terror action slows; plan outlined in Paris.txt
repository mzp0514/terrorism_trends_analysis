Despite pledges to follow the Olympics bombing and explosion of
TWA Flight 800 with tough anti-terrorism legislation, the White
House and Congress remained at odds Tuesday over what to do.
At the White House, President Clinton renewed his call for Congress
to produce "the best, strongest bill" it can.
Among the things Clinton wants are expanded authority for wiretaps
and $ 25 million to study whether chemical tracers called "taggants"
should be placed in all explosives.
But on Capitol Hill, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said Clinton won't
get all the "controversial provisions" he wants.
And Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he doubted
Congress would act this week, as Clinton has asked.
One of the issues of contention: Some lawmakers say expanded wiretapping
authority could lead to invasions of privacy by the government.
As lawmakers in Washington locked horns, representatives from
the United States and other nations were planning an international
response to terrorism.
In Paris, leaders of eight nations vowed cooperative action against
terrorism.
Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the
United States agreed:
-- To police the Internet.
-- To set global standards for detecting bombs.
-- To tighter border checks.
Calling terrorism an attempt to undermine civility, U.S. Attorney
General Janet Reno said, "Today we have stood together, resolute
in our determination not to let this happen."
