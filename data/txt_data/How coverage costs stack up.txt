The costs of commercial terrorism coverage under the new Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) are all across the board, depending on the type of business and its location, experts say. A mom and pop restaurant in a small Midwest town might not have to pay anything to get the terrorism coverage added to its property and casualty insurance.
The cost of coverage for companies in metropolitan areas could equal 10% to 25% of annual property and casualty premiums. But some have been charged much more.
Many companies are willing to pay more for broader stand-alone terrorism coverage. Gail Norstrom, managing director of Aon Risk Services, gives a hypothetical example of how the cost of TRIA coverage might compare with a stand-alone policy:
Suppose a building's owner pays $ 500,000 a year for $ 500 million in property and casualty insurance coverage with a $ 250,000 deductible. Its insurer might charge an extra 25%, or $ 125,000 a year, for TRIA coverage. If the same building's owner wants to buy stand-alone terrorism coverage, it would probably be able to get $ 200 million in coverage with a $ 1 million deductible, Norstrom says. The cost would likely range from $ 600,000 to $ 1 million a year. The advantage is that it would cover domestic as well as foreign terrorism. To add nuclear, chemical and biological terrorism coverage, it would cost much more.
