SALT LAKE CITY - A northern Utah man is accused of putting his juvenile daughter in a chokehold and making her turn purple.
Brian James Gosh, 41, of Morgan, was charged Monday in 2nd District Court with child abuse, a second- degree felony.
According to charging documents, the incident occurred in July. Gosh was angry and yelling at his family because of "a disagreement on how to take care of the family dog," the charges state.
One girl hid in the laundry room, then came out with a broom "to keep Brian Gosh away from her. Brian Gosh walked over, knocked the broom away, then took her down. Once on the ground Brian Gosh, put (the girl) in a jujitsu chokehold," according to charging documents.
The girl said she could not breathe, and Gosh "tightened the grip to the point that (she) could no longer breathe or speak. A witness said that (the victim's) face turned a color of deep purple," the charges state.
When Gosh finally let go, the girl told him "if you're going to kill me get it over with," according to the charges. Charging documents do not say how old the girl is.
Gosh also made headlines when he was arrested in March for investigation of making a threat of terrorism. According to a police affidavit, Gosh threatened to bring a bomb to Intermountain Medical Center after the hospital told him they would not be able to provide him with a COVID-19 test.
