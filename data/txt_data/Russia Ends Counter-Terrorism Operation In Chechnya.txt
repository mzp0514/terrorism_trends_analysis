(RTTNews) - Russia announced Thursday that it was formally ending its decade-long counter-terrorism operation in the volatile southern republic of Chechnya.
The National Anti-terrorist Committee announced Thursday that it has "canceled the decree declaring a counter-terrorist operation in the territory of the republic as of midnight of April 16."
The committee said in a statement that the move is to "create conditions to further normalize the situation in the region, to restore and develop its economic and social infrastructure."
The move comes after Russian President Dmitry Medvedev announced last month that he has ordered the national anti-terror committee to review the tough security restrictions imposed on Chechnya as the security situation has improved in the once restive republic.
Pointing out that "the situation in Chechnya has normalized to a large degree and life is getting back to normal," Medvedev said that he has ordered the national anti-terror committee to take the necessary decisions on the issue as soon as possible.
Russia started its anti-terrorism campaign in Chechnya in September 1999, deploying special police units, carrying out frequent police sweeps, and increasing security at key facilities. The operation was aimed to end Chechnya&apos;s post-Soviet independence movement.
Although the active phase of the anti-terrorism campaign officially ended in 2001, periodic bombings and clashes between militants and federal troops still disrupt Chechnya and nearby regions, particularly Daghestan and Ingushetia.
