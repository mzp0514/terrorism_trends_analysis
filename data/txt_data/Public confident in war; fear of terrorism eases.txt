WASHINGTON -- Public support for President Bush and satisfaction with the progress of the war on terrorism remain high, a USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll shows.
Solid majorities are confident that the United States will remove the Taliban from power in Afghanistan and capture or kill Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
The poll, taken Friday through Sunday, finds strong support not only for Bush's handling of the war, but also for his management of the economy and his response to the anthrax scare.
And despite news reports last week that the lack of clear results so far and mounting deaths of civilians in Afghanistan might erode public patience, the poll shows that 79% say they are satisfied with the progress of the war.
"Journalists listen to the media pundits and talking heads, but the public has a way of screening them out," says Robert Lichter of the Center for Media and Public Affairs.
However, there is some softness in that satisfaction.
Most say they are only somewhat satisfied with the progress of the war, suggesting that it will take more tangible successes to make them believers.
"We need to go in there and get the job done.  . . .  The longer this drags on, the more people are going to hate us," says Louann Johnson, 62, a consultant on Indian affairs in Pearson, Ga.
Bush's overall job approval stands at 87%, virtually unchanged since the attacks 8 weeks ago, after which his approval rating soared from 51% to a record high of 90%.
Three of four also approve of his handling of recent anthrax threats, and seven of 10 back his management of the economy.
The poll was taken shortly after reports last Friday that 400,000 Americans lost jobs last month and that unemployment has reached 5.4%, a 5-year high. The president's approval rating on the economy question suggests that the rallying effect of the war effort goes beyond war-related issues.
"History tells us that we're still at a point in a national crisis when the public is going to stand behind any president," Lichter says.
As the bombing in Afghanistan intensifies and prospects mount for a sizable invasion by U.S. ground troops, approval for the war effort shows little sign of eroding.
More than eight of 10 back the overall operation there -- seven of 10 say they strongly approve -- and two of three favor sending large numbers of ground troops into battle.
Clearly, much of the public patience to stay the course is being driven by deep anger resulting from the deaths of several thousand people in the attacks on New York and Washington.
"They killed us, didn't they? Lack of progress? Then bomb them some more; blanket bomb them. It's fine with me," says Tom Flynn, 49, a mechanic in Scranton, Pa.
Majorities also say they are confident that the United States will remove the Taliban from power in Afghanistan, destroy all terrorist operations there and capture or kill bin Laden. But that confidence has varying degrees of strength, suggesting that some uncertainty will remain until measurable results are produced.
Although anti-war protests are being staged and more forums focus on civilians killed in the bombing, those who favor only a diplomatic or economic solution to the terrorism war show no sign of increasing their influence:
 * 89% of poll respondents say the government should use military force to combat terrorism.
 * 6% say it should use only diplomatic or economic efforts.
The poll also shows that the public is growing more comfortable with warnings of new terrorist attacks, despite critics' charges that the vague warnings do little more than scare people.
Two weeks ago, 47% said the warnings helped people, and 49% said they only scared people. Now, 55% say they help; 40% say they only frighten. And rather than drop them, seven of 10 say public alerts should be continued, even if no details can be released.
At the same time, people's worries about whether they or someone in their family will become a victim of a terrorist attack appear to be easing:
 * Three days after the Sept. 11 attacks, 51% said they were very or somewhat worried.
 * In early October, when anthrax scares surfaced, that number jumped to 59%
 * Now, the percentage of those worried about becoming victims has shrunk to 40%. And 31% say they are not worried at all.
