WooHoo: Facebook Terrorism
There are few things more satisfying than changing your friend Steve's status to "I have herpes of the butt". It's just something that hits you at a visceral level.
The practice of changing your friends' Facebook statuses breeds an odd mindset among the warriors themselves; while being Facebook terrorized is of course a near-fatal blow to the ego, not to mention to your chances with the opposite sex, there is a self-hatred that goes with truly embracing this unforgiving sport.
Sure, your friend is the one who physically changed your status to "Have you guys heard how awesome the new Papa Roach album is?" But weren't you the one who forgot to log out?
And in the end, doesn't that make you the real terrorist?
Think about it.
BooHoo: Actual Terrorism
Alright, this one is admittedly a bit of a no-brainer, but check this out: modern terrorists have really gone downhill.
Even the big bowel movement himself, Bin Laden, used to have some variety. I mean, he was bombing boats, hotels, whatever his eyes fell on. It was a time when terrorists put some thought into their craft.
Now? Guys gets caught with explodey shoes getting on a plane. Guy gets caught with an explodey crotch on a plane. Guy gets caught with explodey suitcase outside a plane. There was even a guy whose plan was to hijack a plane, and fly it - wait for it - into another plane!
This is bullshit! Listen, I know you fucking morons got lucky with the planes one time, but give it a rest already.
Today's terrorists just don't know about work ethic, anymore.
