JUDGE TO CONSIDER MOVING CASE OUT OF THE BAY AREA
By JOSH POLTILOVE

TAMPA — Jury selection begins today for the trial of Sami Al-Arian on terrorism-related charges.
The former University of South Florida professor and his three co-defendants, Sameeh Hammoudeh, Hatim Naji Fariz and Ghassan Zayed Ballut, are accused of helping organize and finance the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, one of the most violent terrorist groups in the Middle East.
The trial, expected to last six months, is set to begin June 6.
U.S. District Judge James Moody, however, is considering moving Al-Arian's case out of the Tampa Bay area if the jury selection process fails. Defense attorneys have requested a change of venue because of intensive media coverage in the area; they argue it may have tainted a jury pool.
Moody plans to bring in 50 prospective jurors each day beginning today. About 150 people are being considered to hear the trial.
Also today, Moody is expected to consider a motion filed by several media outlets seeking permission to report basic information about potential jurors. Moody issued an order barring photographs, sketches and verbal descriptions of jurors.
