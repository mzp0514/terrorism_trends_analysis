AS A MEMBER of the media, op-ed columnist Elmer Smith should be the last person to claim that the NRA is giving terrorists cover. Perhaps he ought to look at himself and his own profession.
Terror wouldn't work very well if we didn't have the media to drive it home, into every citizen's house and daily life. Terrorism is able to TERRORIZE because the media puts horrible acts front-and-center at every opportunity. And not just large acts of terror like 9/11 (did anybody forget to tell Mr. Smith that this atrocity involved no guns?), but in everyday life.
The media like to sensationalize, almost with sickening glee, the daily crimes that Americans commit against other Americans. That includes the entertainment sector, through movies, TV and music.
We passed the Brady Bill, and we now know that - surprise! - it does nothing to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists and criminals. (I seem to remember the NRA predicting just that many years ago, but, then again, what does the NRA know about guns?) Firearms are regulated to the hilt and even outlawed in some U.S. cities.
Britain and Australia have almost total bans, and now lead the industrialized world in violent crime, according to the International Crime Victimization Survey. Gun control has been tried. And it failed miserably.
