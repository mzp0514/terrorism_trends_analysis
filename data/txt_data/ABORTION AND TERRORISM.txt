THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION
AS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of women, men and children marched on the mall last Sunday in support of abortion rights, presidential adviser Karen Hughes seemed to compare their cause to terrorism.
Asked on CNN if abortion would become an issue in the presidential election, Ms. Hughes said, ". . . I frankly think it's changing somewhat.
I think after Sept. 11th the American people are valuing life more and realizing that we need policies to value the dignity and worth of every life."
Ms. Hughes said -- accurately -- that Americans want to reduce the number of abortions. Then she added, "I think those are the kind of policies that the American people can support at a time when we're facing an enemy, and really the fundamental difference between us and the terror network we fight is that we value every life. . . . Unfortunately our enemies in the terror network . . . don't value life, not even the innocent and not even their own."
Ms. Hughes was shocked, shocked that anyone would think she was comparing abortion rights and terrorism. "I would never make such a comparison," she said.
Spare us. The question was about abortion; the answer was the Bush camp's silver-bullet answer for any question: 9-11.
