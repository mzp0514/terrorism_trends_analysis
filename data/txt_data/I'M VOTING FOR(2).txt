Barack Obama
Mitt Romney suffers from selective memory when he focuses on the failure of the Obama administration to "admit" that the Benghazi attack was an act of terrorism, while conveniently forgetting that the George W. Bush administration never did admit that the attack on Iraq, which involved us in a lengthy and costly ? both financially and in American lives ? war was based on faulty claims of their weapons of mass destruction.
President Barack Obama has been left to clean up a number of W's messes, but Romney seems intent on blaming the present for the sins of the past.

Mitt Romney
In March 2006 members of the U.S. Senate discussed raising the debt limit. Then Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., gave a speech, the first paragraph quoted verbatim: "The fact that we are here today to debate raising the debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the U.S. government cannot pay its own bills. It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our government's reckless fiscal policies."
The debt is now $16 trillion, with $6 trillion in four years. It is time to stop blaming "the mess we inherited" because Obama has made it worse.
? Nancy Vogt, Sun Prairie
