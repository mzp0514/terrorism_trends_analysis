Every decade, the (Overton) window on what is acceptable gets opened a little further. 
A hundred years ago, women flirted by wearing a more provocative hat. Seventy years ago, smoking was marketed in movies. In the 1960s, people asked if God was dead. The '80s saw an increase in porn, and greed was good. Nudity, violence, terrorism, gangster rap and mass killings followed. 
Today, the progressive left wants you to believe that everything you learned was wrong. Bad is good, cops are racists, math is racist, America was founded in 1619, made in China is better than made in the USA, immigration for all, free speech is bad, self-defense is bad, self-reliance is bad and fathers are bad. 
The liberal window of acceptability needs to start closing. The left can't get a pass on what they have done. Legislation against social media and tech giants' manipulation, lawlessness, what's taught in our schools and nonprofits that teach hate must take place, but won't with a Joe Biden victory. 
President Trump made winning look so easy that voters focused on his personality instead of his policies. "Train up a child in the way he should go and when he is older, he will not depart from it."
