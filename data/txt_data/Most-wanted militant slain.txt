JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Southeast Asia's most-wanted Islamist militant was killed during a raid by an American-trained anti-terrorism squad in Indonesia on Thursday, ending a long hunt for an erstwhile accountant linked to a rash of terrorist attacks, including bombings on the resort island of Bali and July suicide attacks on two American luxury hotels in Jakarta. 
Noordin Mohammad Top, a university-educated master of disguises, eluded police for eight years but was finally cornered in a rented house surrounded by palm trees in central Java. Noordin declined to surrender, kept shooting and died with "bullets in his pockets," Indonesia's police chief, Bambang Hendarso Danuri, told reporters. His body and those of three confederates were found in the bathroom. 
Police began the operation after the arrest Wednesday of two militants who provided information that led to Noordin's rented house near the town of Solo. 
Noordin, who claimed links to al-Qaida and received funding from supporters in the Middle East, led a small but vicious Islamist militant group. The group, which has attacked hotels, bars and other targets, declared after a 2004 attack on the Australian embassy in Jakarta that it wanted "to make Western nations tremble." 
Noordin's death and the capture of many of his associates shows that, after a slow start, Indonesian police are winning the battle to uproot militancy, according to Andi Widjajanto, a terrorism expert at the University of Indonesia.
