ARLINGTON, Va. -- Only green plastic signs mark the graves of
Michael George Heiser and Brian McVeigh.
Among the 19 Americans who died when a truck bomb exploded outside
their barracks in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, on June 25, they were
buried too recently to have received the simple white tombstones
that dot Arlington National Cemetery.
A few yards away, their families gathered at a commemoration Wednesday
with relatives of other Americans slain by terrorists, from the
World Trade Center in New York to Beirut.
"Terrorism is not an anonymous act that happens to other people,"
said Wendy Giebler-Sefcik, whose husband, William Giebler, died
when Pan Am Flight 103 was exploded over Scotland in 1988. "It
is our duty to put a face on the ravages of terrorism."
Those who died in Dhahran were the focus of the ceremony. Apart
from Heiser and McVeigh, they are buried elsewhere across the
nation.
It was the 13th such commemoration by No Greater Love, an organization
that assists the families of Americans who died in service to
their country or in terrorist acts.
"I am here to share a little bit with the families who lost loved
ones in my country," Saudi Ambassador Prince Bandar Bin Sultan
told those assembled on an overcast, windswept day. "The American
people should be proud" of those who died. "They were doing
the Lord's job in a faraway place."
The Pentagon has admitted that it failed to protect the base adequately.
The Saudis had been reluctant to move an anti-terrorist fence
farther away from the barracks.
The prince promised "swift and harsh justice" for the perpetrators,
who have yet to be found. Four Saudis who confessed to the November
bombing of a U.S.-run military training center in Riyadh, the
Saudi capital, were beheaded May 31. That attack killed five Americans.
Grief, not punishment, was more on the minds of the mourners who
listened under gray skies, twice interrupted by hard showers that
stopped as suddenly as they began.
Bridget Brooks of Niceville, Fla., lost her son, Joseph Rimkus,
22, in Dhahran. "They were to come home in two days," she said,
a tear rolling down her cheek.
"Some of these people are still getting their feet on the ground,"
said Washingtonian Donna Bainbridge, who lost her husband, Harry,
on Pan Am 103. She added: "I don't think you can avoid terrorism,
whether you are military or civilian. My husband was an attorney
coming home from a business trip. He was killed in an undeclared
war."
Bainbridge, whose son was born after his father died, sat next
to Thomasina Baynard, of Richmond, Va. Her son was a month old
when his father, James, was killed along with 240 other Marines
in the bombing of their Beirut barracks in 1983. "We come here
every year for my son," Baynard said. "This is a way to honor
his father."
