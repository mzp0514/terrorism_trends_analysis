Only moments after federal agents and the U.S. Capitol Police nabbed Amine El Khalifi for accepting what he thought was an explosive vest from undercover agents, the carping began:
This guy was a bumbler. The vest couldn't actually blow up. The "terrorists" he thought he was working with weren't real terrorists. It was all just another trumped up threat.
A Reuters report dripped with skepticism: "There have been a number of undercover operations in the Washington, D.C., area in recent years in which suspects thought they were plotting to carry out terrorism attacks, but in reality were being monitored by FBI agents and posed no danger."
One commenter on popular liberal website Talking Points Memo asked: "How much money does it cost to put on a show like this? What's the point?"
Another answered: "I would imagine the 'point' is to keep alive the specter of 'the Muslim Menace,' " came the answer.
This is insanity.
The threat is not fabricated. It is very, very real.
The FBI - a very cautious agency, as the NYPD's counterterrorism unit has learned through experience - tracked this man for a year.
He allegedly intended to blow himself up inside the U.S. Capitol, after earlier plans to bomb a restaurant, then a synagogue. He had cooked up a detailed plot and believed he was working with Al Qaeda to help execute it.
He allegedly detonated a test bomb about a month ago in West Virginia.
This failed plot doesn't warrant eye-rolls, nor does the next one.
It demands a round of applause for the agents whose intelligence-gathering rooted out the violent radical.
