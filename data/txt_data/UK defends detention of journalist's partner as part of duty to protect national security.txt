LONDON (AP) - The British government broke its silence Tuesday about the detention of a journalist's partner for nine hours at Heathrow Airport, defending the action and saying authorities "have a duty to protect the public and our national security."
A lawyer said the detained man, David Miranda, had begun legal action against the government, calling his detention "unlawful" and seeking assurances that British officials would not share data seized from him with anyone else. Police used a contentious anti-terrorism law to detain Miranda, the partner of Guardian newspaper journalist Glenn Greenwald, on Sunday. Greenwald has published stories about U.S. and British surveillance programs based on documents leaked by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.
Miranda was held for nearly nine hours - the maximum allowed by law - and had electronic equipment confiscated.
Miranda, a 28-year-old university student, was traveling home to Brazil after visiting Germany, where he met with Laura Poitras, a U.S. filmmaker who has worked with Greenwald on the NSA stories. Greenwald said Miranda was carrying materials between the two, but didn't specify what they were.
"The government and the police have a duty to protect the public and our national security," the Home Office said in a statement, adding that police were right to stop people suspected of possessing "highly sensitive stolen information that would help terrorism."
