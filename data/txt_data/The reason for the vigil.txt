TO THE EDITOR:
As a member of the Lancaster Coalition for Peace and Justice, I am disturbed by the negative letter from Daniel D. Jury ("Demonstrators lack sincerity," Intell, April 4).
I would like to clarify that the gathering on the Lancaster County Courthouse steps was a vigil, not a demonstration. It was a vigil held by those committed to peace and justice, actively opposing injustice, war, militarism and other forms of violence and held silently to mourn the dead and stand in solidarity, sympathizing with the bereaved and injured.
The war waged by the United States has caused the deaths of many innocent people and destabilized Iraq, and its long-term effects on relations between countries and regions of the world will be disastrous. Terrorism cannot be defeated by such means. While hunger, poverty, injustice and exploitation are experienced by so many and the policies of "superpowers" are seen as contributing to them, genuine despair will sometimes turn to desperation and will fuel terrorism.
We urge all political and military authorities, national and international, to turn away from strategies of war and combine their efforts to seek strategies for an inclusive, just and equal global society. Without that, we will never see peace.
Sherry Wolfe, Lancaster
