To the Editor:
In your Dec. 10 editorial ''Fighting Qaddafi With a Wet Noodle,'' you state that ''the unhappy truth is that an oil embargo can't work'' as a counter to Libyan terrorism.
As a co-sponsor of Senate legislation to end all oil imports from Libya, I believe that it is uncon-scionable for the United States and other countries to spend billions of dollars for Libyan oil, which will then be used to finance acts of aggression and terrorism, including assassination attempts against our leaders and our representatives overseas.
Edward Kennedy letter responds to December 10 editorial, "Fighting Qaddafi With a Wet Noodle"
Without an end to this unseemly commercial relationship with Libya, the United States will lack the necessary moral basis to organize the broader international political and, if necessary, military response to put an end to gross Libyan violations of international law.
I therefore welcome President Reagan's decision to call upon all Americans to leave Libya and all American companies to scale down their operations, but I believe that a complete embargo is the necessary next step if our policy on Libya is to achieve credibility at home and abroad.
EDWARD M. KENNEDY, U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, Washington, Dec. 10, 1981
