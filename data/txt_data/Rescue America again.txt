Of course the fear of terrorism dominated the 2004 presidential election. It did so because our current administration framed the debate that way.
I can see why President Bush would want us to channel all our anxieties toward an outside enemy to the point where we give up our civil liberties and attention to equally pressing crises. What I can't understand is why we continue to let him do this.
We're doing more harm to our nation and its reputation in the world than al-Qaida could ever accomplish.
Even not counting the civilian deaths Bush dismisses as collateral damage, haven't we killed and maimed enough people in our unprovoked Iraq war? Hasn't the number of people dying prematurely because of lack of environmental protection and affordable health care become unacceptable? Hasn't the exporting of jobs, leaving families without means of support, become important enough to deal with now that middle-class as well as working-class people are laid off?
Are we really comfortable with cutting safety nets - Medicaid, Title 8 housing, Head Start - for our most vulnerable citizens to give huge tax cuts to the wealthy?
We should do all we can to protect ourselves from terrorism and still keep the other issues I have mentioned on our agenda. Think back to the 1950s. Were we annihilated or taken over by communists when Margaret Chase Smith rescued our nation from Joseph McCarthy's obsessive focus?
I don't think so.
