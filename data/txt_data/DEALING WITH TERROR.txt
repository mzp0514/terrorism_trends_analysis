In a response to Greg Molinda's Oct. 8 letter, "Halting Terrorism": I cannot say how much disgust came with reading such comments. This man is acting like he's so much smarter than the rest of the world, smarter than the president and his staff, and it's just ridiculous!
Mr. Molinda should remember that the Bush administration has firsthand experience in dealing with terrorism, and I'm sure its officials would love to put an end to it altogether. But it does not work like that, and the Bush administration knows this. The administration knows a lot more than it lets on about terrorism so that people like Mr. Molinda are safe.
 Universally hated? What exactly does that mean?
 I don't think Great Britain hates us or Poland or Japan. The list could go on of countries that do not hate America. And if you're a proud American, why should you care what other countries like France think? It's heartbreaking to read letters throughout the country that compare the Bush administration to a "regime"!
 These people must have no idea what it's like living under a regime.  Maybe they could all go live in a country where there is a real regime and see how much of a difference there truly is. It could make for good reality TV.
