The judge in Britain's biggest terrorism trial removed himself from the case today, a day after the proceedings began, and ordered a new trial.
Crown Court Judge John MacDermott said he was discharging himself from the case because the prosecution's comments about the reliability of its star witness, Raymond Gilmour, a police informant, ''cannot be sustained by admissible evidence.''
Judge MacDermott, hearing the case without a jury, ordered a new trial to begin next Tuesday with a new judge.
On trial are 39 purported members of the outlawed Irish Republican Army and its leftist offshoot, the Irish National Liberation Army, who face a total of 186 charges ranging from armed robbery to murder.
In his opening statement on Monday, the prosecutor, Sir John McLeavy, said Mr. Gilmour's information to the police had been ''reliable and accurate.'' A defense lawyer, Desmond Boal, objected, saying the prosecution view of Mr. Gilmour's information was unwarranted and damaging to his case.
Judge MacDermott agreed and said that if the case had been heard by a jury ''I would have discharged that jury and recommended with a fresh jury.'' He said the ''credit-worthiness'' of Mr. Gilmour was the primary issue.
