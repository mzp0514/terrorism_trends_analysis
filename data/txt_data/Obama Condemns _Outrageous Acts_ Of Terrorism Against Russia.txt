(RTTNews) - President Barack Obama released a statement Monday in response to the suicide bombing attacks on Moscow&apos;s Metro system that left 37 people dead.
"The American people stand united with the people of Russia in opposition to violent extremism and heinous terrorist attacks that demonstrate such disregard for human life, and we condemn these outrageous acts," Obama said.
He added, "My thoughts and prayers go out to those who lost loved ones, and I wish all who sustained injuries a successful recovery."
Monday morning, two female suicide bombers from a North Caucasus rebel group blew themselves up in quick succession in the crowded subway railroad network of Moscow, killing 37 people and wounding about 70 others.
The first explosion hit the second carriage of a train at the central Lubbyanka station at 7:52 am local time, killing 25 passengers. Forty minutes later, a second explosion struck at the rear of a train at the Park Kultury Metro Station in the southwest of the city, killing 12 people.
Following the attacks, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said his government would act "without compromise" to root out terrorists. He also said that the policy to "suppress terrorism in our country and the fight with terrorism will be continued ... until the end."
The attacks were the worst to hit the Russian capital in six years.
