Democrats have established their approach to the war on terror:
* Congressman John Murtha, D-Pa., supports abandoning the fledgling Iraqi democracy by redeploying American troops to "nearby" Okinawa.
* Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.V., insists Iraqis would be better off with Saddam Hussein back in power, revealing a cultural arrogance that presumes democracy for Muslims is unattainable.
* Congressman John Dingell, D-Mich., refuses to take sides between Israel and Hezbollah, yet no greater distinction exists between a key American ally and a nihilistic terrorist horde.
* Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., advocates pampering throat-slitting jihadist detainees in Guantanamo, while he denigrates the patriotic service of their American guards and interrogators by comparing them to Nazis.
* Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., insists we are less safe now than five years ago because the Bush administration's swashbuckling war on terror has alienated allies around the world - as if terrorism did not exist before 9/11.
Natan Sharansky, noted scholar and survivor of Soviet gulags, disagrees, saying, "If you had no losses in five years from terrorist attacks, it only means that you are tremendously successful in this struggle against this enemy, that your government, your intelligence, are tremendously, unbelievably successful."
Victory over terrorism requires more than retreat, appeasement, undermining troop morale and screaming "warmonger." To borrow from the title of Al Gore's global-warming scare film, that Democrats cannot be trusted to defeat an enemy hell-bent on destroying us is the real inconvenient truth.
