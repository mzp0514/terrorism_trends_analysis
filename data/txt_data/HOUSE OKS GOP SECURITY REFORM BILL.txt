House Republican leaders yesterday easily pushed through sweeping new law enforcement powers as part of a Sept. 11 anti-terrorism package. Now the House must negotiate a truce with the Senate on those measures to get President Bush's signature before the elections.

The House voted 282-134 to approve the GOP leaders' bill to create a new national intelligence director and a national counterterrorism center as recommended by the 9/11 commission. But they also included new government anti-terrorism, deportation, border security and identity theft powers to the bill that the Senate had rejected.
The two sides now will come together to try to find a middle ground before Election Day, Congress' Republican leaders said.
House members added a provision yesterday allowing U.S. authorities to deport foreigners under the same terrorism regulations that can keep them out. They also tempered an amendment that would have made it easier to deport illegal immigrants to countries accused of torture by instead adding a provision to detain them indefinitely.
The Senate bill more faithfully follows what the commission wanted and does not divide lawmakers down partisan lines.
The White House endorsed the House GOP bill, as it did the Senate version, but said both need work.
Congress also hit a roadblock on a bill providing $11.8 billion in relief to hurricane victims and $2.9 billion for farmers hit by drought, floods and other emergencies. The bill was held up by an argument over a milk support program.
