   PRAGUE, Czech Republic -- A passenger claiming to have an explosive device tried to hijack a Russian airliner over Europe on Thursday, but was subdued by other people on board, authorities said.
The Russian man was detained after the Aeroflot Airbus A320 made an emergency landing at Prague's international airport, police said. Authorities said they did not suspect terrorism.
The plane was en route from Moscow to Geneva when the man apparently tried to break into the cockpit, demanding the pilots fly to Africa, police spokesman Pavel Hantak said. The man claimed he had an explosive device, Aeroflot deputy director Lev Koshlyakov told Russia's Rossiya television.
The suspect was then "pacified on board the plane," allowing the pilots to make an emergency landing, Hantak said. Two Czech jet fighters were dispatched, but no intervention was necessary, said Czech Defense Ministry spokesman Andrej Cirtek.
Police were searching the plane for explosives, Hantak said. Authorities did not suspect a terror plot, said Jan Subert, spokesman for the Czech counterintelligence service.
"From what we know, the incident had nothing to do with terrorism," he said.
The suspect was traveling with eight family members, including three children, Hantak said. He said the family members were not involved in the incident.
