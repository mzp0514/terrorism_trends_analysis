In just 2 weeks, once-unthinkable threats now seem vivid. The country's 3,500 crop-duster aircraft, for example, each armed with 200 pounds of fuel and up to 600 pounds of poison, suddenly pose potential peril.
Addressing that danger alone -- one among scores -- demands the attention of a sweep of agencies from the Federal Aviation Administration, which temporarily grounded the planes, to chemical regulators and a half-dozen or more law-enforcement and intelligence operations.
Coordinating their responses while sorting out new home-defense priorities is an administrative nightmare that is about to fall to Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, and no less to President Bush, who must define Ridge's authority as head of the soon-to-be-formed Office of Homeland Security.
Forty government agencies have a role in fighting terrorism. The White House must decide which of these agencies, if any, Ridge should control directly, which he should play watchdog over and which need only coordination.
The list of vulnerabilities for Ridge to consider is dizzying: There are 301 ports of entry to this country, and each day more than 1.3 million people, 340,000 vehicles and more than 58,000 shipments worth $ 8.8 billion cross our borders. Thousands of reservoirs, football stadiums, malls, train stations and airports are vulnerable. Missile defense? Yes, Ridge will have a say about where that ranks as a priority, too.
The government is so massive that the problem almost defies solution. Before defeating terrorists, Ridge and Bush must devise a plan to overcome a chain of federal bureaucracies that are notoriously impervious to change.
This requires more than just saying that Ridge is in charge. If he is given too much power, his office would only add another layer of bureaucracy. But underreaching carries the risk of leaving him little more to do than make sure the Border Patrol radios are interoperable with those of the Coast Guard. That would make Ridge no more effective than the cloutless "drug czars" who have had so little impact on that problem.
Consider, for instance, the difficulty in applying some wise advice from a prominent terrorism report filed less than a year ago by former senators Gary Hart and Warren Rudman.
The senators concluded that the first lines of home defense lie far from U.S. shores. They are diplomacy, intelligence and a Defense Department able to carry out quick strikes around the world to pre-empt attacks on our soil.
That means, among other things, making sure the CIA moves away from its overreliance on electronic intercepts and develops more human sources: snitches. It means making sure the Defense Department sets aside its appetite for Cold War weapons long enough to buy sturdy, low-tech weapons good for hunting terrorists in the mountains.
But Ridge can't run the CIA and the Defense Department -- not to mention the FBI, the Immigration Service and three dozen other agencies and departments that deal with home-defense issues.
As a way of getting started, Ridge instead needs the authority to manage a series of specific tasks that cross departmental lines. Among the most urgent :
 * Figure out why intelligence is so poorly coordinated and shared that glaring hints of the terrorists' Sept. 11 strategy were overlooked. This should lead quickly to restructuring and new resources, while encouraging agencies to improve themselves in the interim.
 * Ensure that all agencies understand and plan for the unexpected in areas such as cyberterrorism, agro-terrorism and chemical and biological attacks.
For matters that fall entirely within one department, Ridge's role should be more as watchdog, uncovering problems and reporting them to the president, so the appropriate people can be held accountable. He needn't run the agencies. As long as he has the president's ear and a powerful role in allocating resources, he'll get cooperation. The Coast Guard, for instance, is plagued with multiple missions -- enforcing fishery laws, drug and illegal-alien interdiction, maritime search and rescues. And now, terrorism. All of that is carried out with an aging fleet hobbled with maintenance problems. In this case, Ridge could act as the Coast Guard's advocate in both Congress and the White House.
Bush's decision to put Ridge's office in the White House, rather than establish a new department, should help. That avoids adding another new bureaucracy and can give as much presidential leverage as Bush is inclined to lend. The more the better.
To win the war against terrorism, to plan for the unthinkable, Ridge must first win a war with the federal bureaucracies. That won't be easy, but as Warren Rudman put it: Just because it's difficult doesn't mean it's impossible.
