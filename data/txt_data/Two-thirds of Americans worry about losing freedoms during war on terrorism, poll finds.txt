WASHINGTON -- Most Americans do not believe their individual freedom has been eroded by post-Sept. 11 laws to combat terrorism, but two-thirds are worried that it could happen, according to an Associated Press poll.
The survey found sharply partisan differences on how people view Attorney General John Ashcroft.
About two-thirds of respondents said they are somewhat or very concerned about the possible loss of freedom from such measures.
On a separate question, only 31 percent said they think people's legal rights have been violated while 58 percent said they had not, according to the poll conducted for the AP by ICR/International Communications Research of Media, Pa.
About half of those polled said the Bush administration has been about right in using new laws to fight terrorism. Some 24 percent say the government has gone too far and 18 percent said it has not gone far enough.
The poll also found 51 percent of people believe it will be necessary for average people to give up some individual freedom as part of the fight against terrorism.
The poll found that several groups including the most affluent, the highest-educated, Democrats and blacks were more likely to believe legal rights have been violated. "I'm certain some people's rights have been taken away," said Jeff Warner, a 32-year-old Democrat from Flushing, Mich. "I'm sure that some people of Arab descent have been mistreated. I think that if President Bush gets re-elected, it's going to get much worse."
The AP poll found 39 percent view Ashcroft favorably and 20 percent unfavorably, with 41 percent offering no opinion.
