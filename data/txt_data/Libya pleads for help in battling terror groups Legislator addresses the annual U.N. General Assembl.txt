Libya pleaded with the international community on Saturday to help it stand up to Islamist-allied militias that have taken control of government buildings, saying the United Nations must impose sanctions or risk a terrorist expansion throughout North Africa.
Ageila Saleh Eissa, president of the House of Representatives, addressed the annual U.N. General Assembly of world leaders after weeks of fighting among rival militias in Libya forced nearly a quarter-million people to flee their homes.
From this podium, I say that turning a blind eye to terrorism in Libya is deemed unacceptable, Eissa said. 
The international community has either to stand with the elected, legitimate authorities and (impose sanctions) or say very clearly that the Libyans have to face terrorism alone, Eissa said. Hence, the international community must withstand the effects of terrorism expansion in North Africa and the Sahel region.
Libya has grown increasingly lawless in recent weeks, and has been witnessing the worst violence since the 2011 overthrow of longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi. 
The violence, which erupted in July, forced Libya's elected House of Representatives to convene in the eastern city of Tobruk after militias seized the capital, Tripoli, and the country's second-largest city, Benghazi. The militias, meanwhile, formed their own government and revived Libya's outgoing parliament in Tripoli.
