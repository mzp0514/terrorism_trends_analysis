To the Editor:
  Francine Prose's essay ''The Unthinkable, Right Around the Corner'' (New York Observed, Jan. 27) demonstrates how New Yorkers have been cowed like sheep since 9/11. The ''critical response vehicle surge'' is a wasteful and futile use of valuable city resources in the name of police macho.
As for Commissioner Ray Kelly's rationale that these adolescent vehicular drills keep terrorists off-balance because they are always held at different days and times at random locations around the city, phooey. We see the lineups of 20 to 70 vehicles nearly daily right outside Penn Station, sometimes at 7 a.m., sometimes at 10 a.m. Boy, that will keep the terrorist guessing who wants to make a splash by taking out 20 police cars with ordnance! 
  If the Police Department really wants to do the unexpected, try having those thousands of young police officers go out on foot and bicycle and actually meet people in the communities that they are policing.
  As for the sirens, noise pollution has consistently ranked ahead of secondhand smoke, fatty burgers and any number of other quality-of-life issues that Mayor Bloomberg has been praised for tackling. It's time he reined in the boyish enthusiasm for patrol car posses.
