AFTER NEARLY 20 years in a Peruvian jail on terrorism-related charges, Lori Berenson returned to New York a free woman Thursday.
The 46-year-old American was all smiles as she walked through Kennedy Airport with her uncle - even after a four-hour interrogation at customs.
"I just want to say I'm very grateful for the interest and I'm not going to be giving any further declarations," she said. "I'm very grateful to all the people who've helped over the years and I'm glad to be with my family."
Berenson's 6-year-old son, Salvador, - who was born behind bars in Peru - traveled with her on the overnight flight. He left the airport ahead of her with her parents, college professors Rhoda and Mark Berenson.
Berenson spent the past five years living quietly in Lima after Peruvian authorities paroled her in 2010. She was able to make a brief visit home a year later but then was barred from leaving Peru again until her full 20-year sentence elapsed.
Her uncle Ken Berenson, 70, of Mount Vernon, Westchester County, said Berenson was "enthusiastic" about beginning a fresh life with her son in New York City and plans to stay with her parents in their Kips Bay apartment for now.
Berensonwent to Peru in 1994, where her involvement with the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement ultimately led to a "collaborating with terrorism" conviction.
