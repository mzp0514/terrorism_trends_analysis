President Bush is a man of compassion -- and of bold decision-making.  
As described by his partner in the war on terrorism, Prime Minister Tony Blair, Bush is "a strong leader ... unyielding, and unflinching and determined in the fight we face together" ("Buddies against terrorism revel without regrets," May 18 and PghTrib.com). That's an accurate evaluation of Blair also. 
Only weeks after terrorists attacked us on 9/11, Blair and Bush took on the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, which had been hosting al-Qaida terrorists. And in March 2003, they decided to have a multination force invade Iraq, which had ignored U.N. requests to search for WMD. 
Saddam's army was defeated and the invaders were greeted as liberators. However, something unexpected happened! Sunni and Shiite terrorists have been killing thousands of their own peaceful countrymen in order to prevent the efforts of the Iraqi government to rebuild the country. 
Afghanistan and Iraq are the foremost examples of Blair's and Bush's plan to fight the terrorists where they come from, before they hit us again. With an attitude of defeatism and appeasement, many suggest that we should withdraw from Iraq. This would allow the terrorists a free hand there and beyond, even to our own land.
