Russian President Vladimir Putin vetoed media legislation Monday that would have sharply restricted terrorism coverage, but lashed out at the country's press, television and radio for their handing of last month's hostage crisis at a Moscow theater.
The legislation, passed by both houses of parliament, would have prohibited reports seen as hindering counter-terrorist operations and banned the broadcast or publication of rebel statements or extremist "propaganda."
Putin's decision to veto the measure ahead of next year's parliamentary elections was widely seen as an attempt to burnish his image as a defender of free speech. Critics have accused him and his government of cracking down on independent television.
"No truly democratic power can exist without publicity and openness, which are provided by the mass media," Putin said, adding that he had asked parliamentary leaders to form a commission to come up with new legislation.
But the president, who made the announcement during a Kremlin meeting with the heads of major media organizations, also took the opportunity to blast the media for what he considered irresponsible coverage of last month's Moscow theater siege.
"Television pictures from one channel a few minutes before the storming, when the movement of special forces was shown, could have led to an enormous tragedy," Putin told the assembled journalists.
He accused some media of acting irresponsibly to "boost their ratings."
