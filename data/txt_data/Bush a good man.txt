What is evil? Who is evil? CNN commentator Jack Cafferty argues that Republicans should "condemn the evil their party put in the White House in the previous eight years" ("Media Monday," March 16 and PghTrib.com). 
Following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, President Bush made it his foremost priority to make us safe from terrorists. The success of his policy is amazing: There were no new terrorist attacks here during his presidency. Yet, to the "blame America" crowd, he is an evil man. 
They think we deserved the attacks. They also didn't like it when President Reagan rightfully called the Soviet Union "the evil empire" and when President Bush referred to Iraq, Iran and North Korea as an "axis of evil." 
There was tremendous pressure on Bush to accept defeat in Iraq -- and thus surrender in the war on terrorism. Fortunately, he didn't! 
The dramatic decline of terrorism following the 2007 troop surge enabled Bush and the Iraqi government to agree on a successive decrease of the U.S. presence in Iraq. 
That was his goal: establishing freedom and democracy in strategically located Iraq, benefiting all nations. George W. Bush, a statesman of the highest character, is a truly good man!
