A YEMENI CLERIC who boasted of being Osama Bin Laden's "personal sheik" was convicted yesterday of plotting in Brooklyn to help finance Al Qaeda and Hamas.
A Brooklyn federal jury found Sheik Mohammed Ali Hassan Al-Moayad and his assistant, Mohammed Zayed, guilty of conspiring to support the two terror groups.
"Today's convictions mark another important step in our war on terrorism," said U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
After hearing the verdict, the 56-year-old sheik and Zayed, 31, erupted in angry protest.
"I want another lawyer," Zayed yelled in Arabic as U.S. marshals rushed him and the sheik from the packed courtroom.
Jurors, who deliberated five days, said a secretly recorded videotape of the defendants promising to funnel $2.5 million raised in Brooklyn to terrorists weighed heavily on their decision.
"Nothing about Osama Bin Laden had anything to do with our decision," said a male juror, responding to defense claims that prosecutors exploited the panel's fears of terrorism by invoking Bin Laden's name.
"We mainly based it [the verdict] on the evidence we had," a female juror said.
FBI informant Mohamed Alanssi, who recorded the damning conversation in a German hotel room, also testified Al-Moayad told him he delivered $20 million to Bin Laden. Alanssi testified after setting himself on fire last year in front of the White House.
Al-Moayad's attorney, William Goodman, blasted the verdict as "an injustice."
"Rather than cripple the cause of terrorism, a prosecution such as this can only strengthen those people in the world who wish to perpetrate terrorism," Goodman said.
