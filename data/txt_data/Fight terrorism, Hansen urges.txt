Utah Rep. James Hansen told a mostly student audience Tuesday that a big reason they are able to study so freely is because of the United States military. But that same freedom Americans enjoy, Hansen explained, is a big factor in the recent terrorist attacks.
"People want to live like we do, and I honestly think that's why the terrorists hate us," he said.
Hansen urged the packed audience at the Hinckley Institute on the University of Utah campus to commit to fighting terrorism.
Terrorists are "totally committed to destroying America," Hansen said. "I know they have the will. Do we have the will to win?" Are Americans willing to put up tax dollars for that effort? he asked.
Hansen said Americans didn't seem as bothered when earlier strikes by terrorists -- Pan Am 103, the earlier, less-damaging World Trade Center bombing, the attack on the USS Cole -- didn't hit as close to home. But with Sept. 11, "I think America cried," Hansen said.
And the terrorism isn't over. "It's probably not going to go away," he added.
To fight terrorists, Hansen suggested cutting down the terrorists' resources. "We can basically grind these people down," he said. Hansen said he supports President George W. Bush, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell in their efforts.
Hansen also promoted implementation of alternative energy sources such as nuclear and geothermal, which, he said, are safe and clean, to reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels.
Addressing redistricting, Hansen said that while he is not happy about the outcome in Utah, "they can do it the way they want; it's their sandbox."
