WASHINGTON (AP) - Security has been tightened for Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and drug policy coordinator William J. Bennett, but officials declined Tuesday to directly link the measures to Colombia's crackdown on drug traffickers.  ''It was a combination of threats in the area of terrorism, both from domestic concerns and from international areas.
Also, narco-terrorism was a part of it,'' an FBI spokesman, Milt Ahlerich, said about the increase in security for Thornburgh.  The attorney general has been using an armor-plated limousine for three or four weeks, said a Justice Department, spokesman David Runkel. The limo cost more than $100,000. Thornburgh also has been using a basement entrance at the department instead of the street-level door he had been using, Runkel said.  Both Ahlerich and Runkel declined to say whether Colombia's war on drugs was a specific factor. Colombia began a crackdown on drug traffickers in mid-August.  ''Th ere has been since mid-August a heightened concern for security,'' Runkel said. He refused to say whether there had been any specific threats against Thornburgh.  The U.S. Marshals Service has assigned a permanent security detail to protect Bennett, the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, said Bill Dempsey, a spokesman for the Marshals Service.  The security was ''not solely because of the Colombian situation, but partly'' the result of it, Dempsey said.
