The state will take the necessary steps to ensure the safety of Wisconsin residents in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, Gov. Scott McCallum pledged Thursday at the first meeting of his anti-terrorism task force.
The 20-person board includes representatives from health, law enforcement and other professionals with expertise necessary to deal with terrorist attacks.
The governor said he is comfortable the state is prepared in case of terrorism attempts but that state officials need to stay alert to any threats.
"We are taking steps to be more prudent," McCallum said.
The task force has three purposes:
* Study the state's past actions and policies related to terrorism and preparedness.
* Identify and evaluate current terrorism risks.
* Offer direction and guidance to ensure the safety of state residents.
Francis Schmitz, of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern Wisconsin District, said the task force will work to make sure different branches of local, state and federal governments are prepared to quickly identify and manage any suspicious circumstances.
"We're as ready as anyone else," he said.
McCallum said the task force will recommend to him ways to address terrorist threats and preparedness. He said some suggestions could be implemented immediately, while others could be long-term projects.
