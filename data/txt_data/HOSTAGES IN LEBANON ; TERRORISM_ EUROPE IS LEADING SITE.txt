Western Europe was the site of the largest number of international terrorist acts last year, according to a study on international terrorism in 1984 published here today by the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies.
The report, called ''InTer 84,'' said 40.5 percent of the 412 terrorist incidents involving the interests of at least two nations occurred in Western Europe, but many of them were perpetrated by and directed against non-Europeans.
Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, Tel Aviv, reports that Western Europe was site of largest number of international terrorist acts in 1984 (M)There were 349 fatalities in Western Europe.
Only two-tenths of 1 percent of the terrorist acts took place in Eastern Europe.
Following Western Europe was the Middle East with 20.6 percent but this figure did not include attacks on Israelis in Lebanon. Organizations fighting within their own country against foreign armies were not considered in the study as acts of international terrorism.
Even without counting the attacks on Israelis, Lebanon recorded the highest incidence of international terrorism with 9.7 of the total. Spain followed with 8.3 and France with 8.
The report noted a growing number of incidents directly or indirectly supported by governments.
It also noted a sharp increase in leftist terrorist activity in Europe against NATO military targets and legations of NATO countries.
