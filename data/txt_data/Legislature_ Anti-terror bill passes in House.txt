OLYMPIA - The state House has passed an anti-terrorism bill, sidestepping a fight over gun control that had threatened to stall the measure.
Requested by Gov. Gary Locke and Attorney General Christine O. Gregoire, House Bill 1210 would create six new terrorism-related crimes, including possession of a weapon of mass destruction, making terrorist threats, and providing material support to terrorists.
The measure was sent to the Senate late Tuesday night on a 77-20 vote.
"This is very important legislation," said Rep. Al O'Brien, D-Mountlake Terrace. "We might be living in a whole new environment. We'll wait and see."
A standoff developed last week when Rep. Jeannie Darneille, D-Tacoma, introduced an amendment to include firearms as weapons of mass destruction. In response, Rep. Jim Buck, R-Joyce, introduced an amendment specifically excluding firearms from the list.
Darneille said she was worried about the Senate possibly putting a death penalty provision in the bill. She later said Buck had helped allay her concerns by promising to join her in personally urging the Senate not to change the bill substantially.
Both lawmakers agreed to drop their amendments, but Darneille remained dissatisfied with the bill.
She said anti-terrorism laws such as the measure the House passed Tuesday restrict freedom while doing little to make people safer.
"Throughout our country's history, the need for security has been used as a pretext for violation of civil rights," Darneille said Tuesday. "This wave of anti-terrorism actions, all in the name of national security, has launched the most serious civil rights crisis our nation has ever seen."
