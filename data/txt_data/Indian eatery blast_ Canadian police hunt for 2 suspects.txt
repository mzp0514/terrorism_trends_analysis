We're working closely with police and officials in Mississauga on this," Trudeau said in a tweet.Peel Regional Police Chief Jennifer Evans has said that there is no indication that the explosion was an act of terrorism or hate crime."There is no indication that this is a terrorism act. There is no indication that this is a hate crime at this time. We haven't ruled anything out as we start our investigation," Evans was quoted as saying by the Canadian broadcaster CBC.The focus of police is now on finding the two men and identifying just what motivated the attack while two separate private parties were underway, the report said."I want to assure everyone that every police resource is being used to locate the people responsible for this horrendous act," Evans sauid.A 35-year-old Brampton man, a 48-year-old Mississauga woman and a 62-year-old Mississauga woman suffered critical injuries and were rushed to a Toronto trauma centre, according to Peel Region paramedics.All three have since been released from hospital, the report said.The remaining 12 victims who were treated for minor injuries ranged in age from 23 to 69, police said.Approximately 40 people were inside at the time, including several children under age 10, it said, adding that no children were hurt.Meanwhile, Mississauga Mayor Bonnie Crombie extended her sympathies to the victims, saying she was thankful there were no fatalities as a result of the "heinous" crime."This is certainly not anything you would expect to happen in Mississauga, not my Mississauga.
