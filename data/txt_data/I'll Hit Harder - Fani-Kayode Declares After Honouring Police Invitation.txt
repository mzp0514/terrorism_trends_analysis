 Femi Fani-Kayode, a former Minister of Aviation and chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has promised to hit harder after honouring the invitation of the police at the force headquarters, Abuja.
THEWILL recalls that the police had invited Fani-Kayode over alleged conspiracy, criminal and inciting publication from one of his essays.
He was first asked to turn himself in two weeks ago, but he wrote back through his lawyer, Kayode Ajulo, to explain that he would not be available at the initial date set by the police.
He eventually arrived at the Force Headquarters on Tuesday afternoon with his lawyers and supporters following weeks of exchanges between him and the police.
After he left the force headquarters, Fani-Kayode revealed that the police invited him over an article he wrote on 'hegemony and terrorism' as he commended the police for being professional but vowed not to relent in his criticisms.
'Left the Inspector General of Police's office after a cordial interview. The Police were courteous and professional,' he said in a statement.
'I was invited because of my essay titled 'Five Useful Idiots and The Spirit Of The Accursed Slave' which was about Fulani hegemony and terrorism together with other write-ups. No regrets. I will hit harder and write more.'
