El Rukns, a force to be feared in Chicago since the 1960's, has broadened its horizons, according to law-enforcement officials. Four members of the street gang have been charged with conspiring to engage in terrorism in the United States on behalf of the Libyan Government.
The indictment said the four ''contacted, met and dealt with representatives of the Government of Libya in an effort to obtain money in exchange for the commission of a violent act or acts. . .'' A Libyan spokesman denied knowing of the gang.
Among those indicted last week was Jeff Fort, the gang's leader for 20 years, whom members describe as the imam, or religious leader, of their Sunni Moslem group. Earlier this year El Rukns - the name means ''the foundation'' in Arabic -lost a Federal suit seeking recognition as a religious group. Mr. Fort, 39 years old, is serving a 13-year sentence for cocaine trafficking in a Federal prison in Texas and participated in the conspiracy by telephone, the indictment says.
In July, an undercover agent sold the gang a light antitank weapon in which a radio transmitter had been hidden, according to court testimony. Tracing it, agents found two arms caches that included three machine guns, 32 other guns, hand grenades and a rocket launcher.
