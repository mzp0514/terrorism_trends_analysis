Gwinnett County's terrorism insurance rates have gone down while its coverage has gone up as a result of the federal government's pledge to protect the insurance companies.
The county was able to buy $100 million in terrorism insurance for 2003, double what was available last year in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. But it is paying $348,000 for it, compared with $390,000 in 2002.

"It's basically being rationed out," said Chuck Huckleberry, risk management division director for the county. "We're trying to get as much as we can, but the insurance companies are only willing to take so much risk."
A federal law signed by President Bush Nov. 26 made more insurance available and at lower rates, he said.
"The market is a little better, and it helps that we've gone this long without another incident," Huckleberry said. "But it's still very tight."
Under the law, the government would reimburse the insurance industry as much as $100 billion after a terrorism attack.
The Sept. 11 attacks reportedly drained an estimated $40 billion from the insurance industry's estimated $210 billion in reserves. Companies told the White House last year they could not withstand another such blow.
After Sept. 11, Gwinnett County found it hard to even acquire terrorism insurance, which usually had been tossed into contracts as a freebie. It ultimately had to go to Lloyd's of London to find a company that would offer it.
The county is still using Lloyd's for its terrorism insurance, Huckleberry said.
The $100 million would cover losses related to county facilities, but it still falls short of the estimated $500 million-plus in county assets, Huckleberry said. The Gwinnett County Justice and Administration Center has an estimated value of $150 million, he said.
For liability related to terrorism, the county would pay out the first $2 million in claims. Then, Huckleberry said, three private firms would pay the next $20 million, and the county would pay out any claims after that.
But the rates for that coverage jumped 43 percent from 2002 to 2003, he said. The premium for 2002 was $694,000. For 2003, it's $948,000.
"We go through an elaborate bidding process," Huckleberry said. "We have three brokers we go through, so we feel like we're getting the best rates out there."
