SAN DIEGO - A fire that destroyed a five-story apartment complex under construction in an upscale residential neighborhood may be the work of a radical environmental group, fire officials said.
The fire, reported by a motorist around 3 a.m Friday, burned for more than three hours and caused more than $ 20 million in damage.
No injuries were reported.
A banner that read, "If you build it, we will burn it," with the initials "ELF," was found next to the building.
The Earth Liberation Front has claimed responsibility for dozens of fires and other acts, causing $ 50 million in damage to luxury homes, ski lodges and sport utility vehicles.
An e-mail message sent seeking comment from a spokesperson for the group was not immediately returned Friday night. There was no immediate claim of responsibility posted on the group's Web site.
San Diego police, the FBI and arson experts were investigating.
ELF describes itself as "an international underground organization that uses direct action in the form of economic sabotage to stop the destruction of the natural environment." The FBI considers ELF one of the nation's most prolific domestic eco-terrorist organizations.
The 206-unit complex in the University Town Centre neighborhood was part of a larger project approved by the City Council in late 2000 that included a hotel and offices.
