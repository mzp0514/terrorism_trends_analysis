President Daniel Ortega Saavedra accused President Reagan today of carrying out a policy of ''war, terrorism and aggression against the people of Nicaragua'' and of ''attempting to manipulate and confuse the people of the United States'' about the nature of the Sandinista revolution.
The President's recent strongly worded attacks on the Sandinistas, Mr. Ortega said, were part of what he characterized as a Reagan Administration effort to ''blackmail and pressure the U.S. Congress'' into approving more aid for ''the mercenaries who have attacked the Nicaraguan people and assassinated workers, teachers, old people and children.''

At the same time, the Nicaraguan leader said, the United States was trying to intimidate Nicaragua through actions ranging from American military maneuvers in neighboring Honduras, abandonment of diplomatic negotiations and the ''strangulation'' of the Nicaraguan economy.
Mr. Ortega's remarks came at ceremonies honoring the mothers of soldiers killed in the war against the insurgents. In his speech, Mr. Ortega quoted extensively from Mr. Reagan's recent comments.
