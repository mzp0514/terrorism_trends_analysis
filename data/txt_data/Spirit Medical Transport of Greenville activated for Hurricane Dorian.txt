 Spirit has sent four EMS personnel and two ambulances, along with additional medical supplies.
 "We anticipate the crews will be on a 7-14-day activation, but that can change as the situation evolves. The crews will stay in the area as long as needed," Hathaway said.
 When the crews arrive at their assigned area, they will be working under the guidance of FEMA, state and local EMS agencies.
 "It is important to know that sending these resources does not affect our ability to provide timely medical response for all the communities we serve," he said.
