American mobsters probably assumed they had a free ride after Sept. 11. East Coast crime families probably breathed easier after the Justice Department turned its attention toward foreigners whose names appeared on terror-watch lists.
For sure, the specter of international terrorism provided the FBI and other law enforcement agencies with bigger fish to fry than guys with nicknames like "Jack the Whack," "Meatball," "Lumpy," "Mush" and "The Claw." Still, as U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder demonstrated last week, there's nothing wrong with occasionally hauling in "small fry" to keep the nation's more traditional crime figures on their toes.
On Thursday, 800 agents and officers from the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Agency and local police in New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Florida arrested 110 suspected mob members, making it one of the biggest organized crime busts in recent memory.
Those arrested are accused of a variety of offenses from extortion and loan sharking to murder and racketeering. Despite all their silly nicknames reminiscent of characters on "The Sopranos," these men, if found guilty, will rank among the worst offenders society has produced.
Law enforcement officials know that even a mob roundup of this size won't put crime families out of commission permanently, but it will disrupt business-as-usual until the next generation of crooks can assume power.
Mobsters aren't stupid. They know that terrorism is the Justice Department's highest priority. Still, a haul like the one made last week is a reminder that domestic criminals can't expect to fly under the radar. Their crimes may be conventional, but they, too, can expect a reckoning.
