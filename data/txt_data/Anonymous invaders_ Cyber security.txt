Suddenly, the Anonymous movement didn't seem quite so faceless with the arrest of a native son.
Jeremy Hammond, born and raised in suburban Glendale Heights, was arrested in early March by FBI agents who accused him of being a "hacktivist" connected to an international cyber terrorism group known as Anonymous.
Hammond, 27, a graduate of Glenbard East High School and a one-time student of the University of Illinois at Chicago, didn't fit the typical profile of a computer hacker: a sinister criminal banging away on a laptop in a Slovakian cybercaf√©.
But he was charged with being part of a group of hacktivists that has taken credit for attacking an array of government and corporate computer networks.
The arrest was a wake-up call for local companies that cyber attacks, and cyberterrorists, are not far from home.
"It's a very real, very serious threat, and it happens a lot more than people think. Unfortunately, many companies think it will never happen to them," said Jeff Bingham, president of Neotec Computer Inc., a Naperville-based computer support and security firm.
Nationwide, the number of computer security breaches, and the resulting costs, are on the rise.
There were 86 reported attacks on computer systems in the United States between October and February, compared with just 11 in the same time frame a year earlier, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Each attack costs organizations an average of $6.75 million to repair, according to a recent study by the computer security firm PGP Corp. and the Ponemon Institute.
