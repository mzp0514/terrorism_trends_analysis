 A 20-year-old Marine based in Norfolk died Sunday in Manama, Bahrain, the Department of Defense said yesterday.
 Lance Cpl. Travis M. Stottlemyer of Hatfield, Pa., died as a result of a non-hostile incident, according to the release. He was assigned to the 3rd Fleet Antiterrorism Security Team Company, Marine Corps Security Forces.
 The incident is under investigation.
 Stottlemyer's fianc√©e, Jeannie Prykowski, said she spoke with him almost every day, including the morning that he died. She's unsure how he died but was told that he just didn't wake up.
 "He was so nice to everyone," she said. "He would make everybody laugh."
 His funeral will be Monday or Tuesday in Hatfield, she said.
 According to a news release from the II Marine Expeditionary Force, Stottlemyer joined the Marines in 2006 and was trained as an infantryman and security force guard. He joined the 3rd Fleet Antiterrorism Security Team company in May 2007. He was promoted to lance corporal in July 2007.
 He was awarded the National Defense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and Global War on Terrorism Service Medal.
 Fleet Antiterrorism Security Teams are designed to be rapidly deployed to provide security for U.S. installations around the world.
