MANHATTAN, Kan. - President Bush said that National Security Agency spying on U.S. citizens and soon-to-expire elements of the Patriot Act were legal means to fight terrorism, in a public embrace of the programs aimed at turning them to political advantage.
In a speech and question-and-answer session, Bush offered his lengthiest public explanation of the NSA eavesdropping, which the administration has taken to calling the "terrorist surveillance program" since it was revealed in December.
He said a Supreme Court ruling in June 2004 found that a Congressional resolution passed shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks gave him the authority to act to protect the country from terrorism.
"It means Congress gave me the authority to use necessary force to protect the American people, but it didn't prescribe the tactics. It said: 'Mr. President, you've got the power to protect us, but we're not going to tell you how."
"If I wanted to break the law, why was I briefing Congress?" he said.
Bush spoke for an hour and 41 minutes, perhaps his longest speech and question-and-answer session as president.
His audience was made up of local residents, students and soldiers from Fort Riley who nearly filled Bramlage Coliseum, a sports arena at Kansas State University.
