(RTTNews) - The United Kingdom is setting up a National Maritime Information Center (NMIC) to prevent sea-borne terror strikes from any of the thousands of small vessels that arrive on its shores every year.
Announcing the Labor government enhanced security preparedness to prevent and deal with terrorist attacks based on chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons, Prime Minister Gordon Brown said in a statement on Monday that the government was putting in place "a package of enhanced nuclear security measures to demonstrate the UK&apos;s commitment to tackling the threat of nuclear terrorism and to encourage other nations to follow suit."
Minister for Security at the Home Office, Lord West said piracy off the Horn of Africa and the sea-borne Mumbai terror attacks of November 2008 highlighted the crying need for such a center. The former head of the British Navy said globalization and mass movement of goods across the world meant crime at sea could affect the UK&apos;s national interest.
The Â£350,000 center would allow government agencies and departments to share information about activity at sea more efficiently, help officials to identify and counter potential threats to the UK at an earlier stage besides protecting its interests at home and abroad.
The NMIC, based at the national military control center at Northwood, Middlesex in north-west London, will involve the Navy, Customs, the UK Border Agency, the Serious Organized Crime Agency and the coast guards.
The monitoring center will target terrorism and other crimes, and respond to disasters as also scan and provide information on potential threats to the sailing events in the 2012 Olympics.
