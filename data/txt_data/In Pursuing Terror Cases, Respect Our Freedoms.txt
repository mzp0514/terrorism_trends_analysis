To the Editor:
  ''A Terror Threat in the Courts,'' by John Farmer (Op-Ed, Jan. 13), recommends detaining terrorism suspects without trial because he claims prosecutions are incapable of preventing terrorism without perilously distorting the criminal justice system. But his solution is more dangerous than the problem. 
  Criminal prosecutions can play a preventive role because the crime of conspiracy is committed whether or not an intended illegal act is completed. All that is required is that two or more people agree to pursue a criminal plot and that one take any step to advance it. 
  Judges must guard against abuse, but they can do so because evidence must be public and subject to cross-examination. By contrast, preventive detention invites government officials to detain suspects on the basis of secret intelligence of dubious reliability, which the suspects have no meaningful opportunity to challenge. 
  The risks to our basic freedoms are simply too great to justify abandoning a criminal justice system that is fully capable of incapacitating terrorists before they strike. Kenneth Roth
