  Re ''Twin Bombings Kill 5 Commanders of Revolutionary Guards Corps in Iran'' (news article, Oct. 19):
  The recent cowardly and inhuman act of terrorism in Iran perpetrated by a foreign-backed terrorist group and orchestrated from beyond Iran's borders is depicted in your report as a sign of ''escalation in hostilities between Iran's leadership and the Baluchi ethnic minority.'' 
  Nothing could be further from the truth. How can the perpetrators of this heinous act of terrorism, which claimed the lives of dozens of Iranian citizens, including Iranian Baluchis, represent Iranian Baluchis? How can the leaders of the terrorist group Jundallah claim any constituency among the Baluchi people while the same Baluchis have been the main target of their brutal terrorist campaign?
  It would be naive to give any credence to baseless claims of Jundallah, whose ties with foreign terrorist groups, extremist elements and some opportunist governments are more than clear to us. But our nation is undeterred by such brutal acts of terrorism sponsored by the enemies of Iran, who seek in vain to play the ''ethnic card'' against Iran.
  The Iranian government and nation are fully determined to eliminate terrorism and bring the perpetrators and organizers of this heinous crime to justice.
