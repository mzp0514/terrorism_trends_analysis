This is NOT what Ahmed Abu Khattala was drinking.
Someone would like you to know that alleged terrorist, Ahmed Abu Khattala was drinking a strawberry frappe, not a mango juice, at a hotel in Benghazi, as he spoke to New York Times reporter David D. Kirkpatrick about his suspected involvement in the attack on the U.S. Consulate last month.
Mr. Abu Khattala's beverage was initially erroneously reported, but, in perhaps the best correction to date, the Times has updated the story with the full correct details about the drink the terror suspect was sipping while scoffing at the US.
The article has been updated with the following correction:
Correction: October 19, 2012 An earlier version of this article described incorrectly a beverage that Ahmed Abu Khattala was drinking at a hotel in Benghazi, Libya. It was a strawberry frappe, not mango juice, which is what he had ordered.
It now reads:
 But just days after President Obama reasserted his vow to bring those responsible to justice, Mr. Abu Khattala spent two leisurely hours on Thursday evening at a crowded luxury hotel, sipping a strawberry frappe on a patio and scoffing at the threats coming from the American and Libyan governments," the Times reported today.
Although we wonder who brought the error to the newspaper's attention, we suppose it is this kind of attention to detail that makes the Times the Times. We reached out to the Foreign Editor Susan Chira to see if she'd be willing to share the story behind the correction. As of this writing, we have yet to receive a response.
