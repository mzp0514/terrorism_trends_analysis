To the Editor:
Re ''Shot at Work, Terror Victims Suffer Anew on Medical Bills'' (front page, Dec. 2): 
  As the wife of a former Iran hostage, Barry Rosen, I am only too aware of the effects, both physical and mental, that victims of terrorism face. The years of therapy and rehabilitation for those whose lives have been destroyed by the violence of terror cannot be summed up in dollars and cents.
  The further victimization that occurs when you realize that you are now fighting the government bureaucracy simply to get the help you need to survive leaves one totally disillusioned and defeated. My family has been there.
  I call upon President-elect Donald Trump and the next Congress to come together and create a vehicle to care for all victims of terror. The terrorists attacked Americans, not San Bernardinians, Bostonians or New Yorkers. Terrorism is a national issue, and Americans should not have to beg for care.
  Each one should be embraced by our country not just by being called heroes who are given a plaque or a parade, and then forgotten, but by making their care and rehabilitation the moral responsibility of every one of us.
  Find the funding to help: That is the obligation of Congress and the president. The time of delay and excuses is past.
