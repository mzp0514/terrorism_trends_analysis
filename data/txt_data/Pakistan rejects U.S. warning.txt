ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) - Pakistan rejected as unwarranted Saturday an apparent warning from the United States that it could be branded a sponsor of terrorism.
The foreign ministry said although the Pakistani government might be sympathetic to a secessionist uprising in Indian-ruled Kashmir, it is firmly opposed to terrorism and does not aid religious organizations involved in the insurgency.
"There is no warrant for any warning," the ministry said in a statement.
On Thursday, the United States warned Pakistan that it could be listed as a sponsor of terrorism - making it ineligible for virtually all U.S. aid - if it gave direct support to Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen, a militant group that operates in Kashmir and is headquartered in Pakistan.
The warning followed comments by U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin earlier in the week that there has long been concern that agencies of the Pakistani government provided "general support" to a number of groups operating in the territory disputed by India and Pakistan.
Washington says there are links between last month's hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane and Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen, which was placed on the State Department's list of terrorist organizations in 1997 when it was called Harkat-ul-Ansar.
