AMMAN, Jordan -- The Jordanian authorities have arrested a senior leader of the Muslim Brotherhood for criticizing the United Arab Emirates, the spokesman for the Brotherhood's political wing said Friday.
The deputy head of the Muslim Brotherhood, Zaki Bani Rushaid, was detained Thursday after a meeting at the party's headquarters in Amman, the Jordanian capital, said the spokesman for the Islamic Action Front, Murad Adayleh. It was the first arrest of a prominent opposition figure in recent years. The state security prosecutor general ordered Mr. Bani Rushaid's arrest on charges of harming relations with a friendly country, according to Brotherhood officials and local media reports citing unnamed government officials.
In an opinion article published this week on websites and social media sites, Mr. Bani Rushaid accused the Emirates of sponsoring terrorism and questioned the legitimacy of its rulers. Last Saturday, the Emirates formally designated the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization.
The Brotherhood issued a statement shortly after Mr. Bani Rushaid's arrest demanding his immediate release. The group is Jordan's main opposition party, but unlike Egypt, Jordan has long accepted the Brotherhood's presence.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
