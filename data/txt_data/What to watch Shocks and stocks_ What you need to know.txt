Market shocks - like terrorism
- move stocks. Often, the knee-jerk reaction is to sell, a risk-control mechanism traders use to avoid big downdrafts. That raises a question: Should you buy the shock-inspired market dip?
Past performance data say buying stocks after a terrorism-induced sell-off is a profitable strategy, as has been the case since Friday's Paris attack.
Says Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Asset Management Group: "In looking at major attacks since 1979, stocks are down on average for five days following the event but were higher than before the attacks in 10 days. In more severe attacks - like 9/11 - stocks can stay down longer. But even in that case, the Dow was higher three months after the attack."
Why the eventual rally? "Since most terrorism (exacts) a more human than economic toll, the long-term impact on the economy and markets seem to be limited," Stone explains.
Buying the dip when fear is high often is the way to play it.
"I think there is a case to buy the first reaction to the downside, because those reactions typically don't last," says Gary Kaltbaum of Kaltbaum Capital Management.
What happens after an attack often benefits markets, adds David Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors.
"Shocks do damage," he says. "The recovery stimulates growth. Also, the central bank reaction function to shocks is always an easing. That's why markets go up after shocks become contained."
