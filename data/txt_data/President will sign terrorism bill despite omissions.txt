A day after the anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing, President Clinton said Saturday he will sign Congress' anti-terrorism bill but complained important parts of the measure "were left on the cutting room floor."
The president, broadcasting his weekly radio address from Russia where he was attending a summit on nuclear weapons, said he was disappointed Congress dropped provisions that would have made it easier for authorities to wiretap all phones used by suspected terrorists.

He also said police should have more leeway to investigate and prosecute terrorists who use machine guns, sawed-off shotguns and explosive devices.
Back home, Clinton's FBI director was upset about a provision creating a special commission to study the activities of federal law enforcement agencies.
In a letter last week to several House and Senate leaders, FBI Director Louis Freeh said he feared that inquiries by the five-member commission would have "a chilling effect on those charged with vigorously enforcing the law."
Clinton, while complaining that the broader wiretap authority and other anti-terrorism measures "were left on the cutting room floor," said the bill still makes important progress.
The bill, which passed Congress this past week, will allow deportation of alien terrorists without disclosing classified evidence against them, prevent fund raising in the United States for terrorists, and require chemical labels in plastic explosives so they can be traced.
"It may not go as far as I would like," Clinton concluded, "but it does strike a real blow against terrorism, and I will be happy to sign it."
