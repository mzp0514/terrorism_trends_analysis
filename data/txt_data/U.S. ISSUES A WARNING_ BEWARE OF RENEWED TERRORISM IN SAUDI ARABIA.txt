DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (AP) -- The United States warned Americans Tuesday to be on guard against more terror attacks in Saudi Arabia, where bombings have killed 24 U.S. servicemen since 1995.
An advisory issued by the embassy in Saudi Arabia, meant for the 40,000 Americans living in the oil-rich kingdom, pointed to a recent threat by ''well-known terrorist Osama bin Laden,'' a millionaire believed living in Afghanistan and known for his anti-Western stance.
''He not only threatened again the U.S. military in Saudi Arabia but also called for the expulsion of American civilians,'' the embassy said, adding bin Laden's warning was broadcast in Britain last week.
Bin Laden, who has been cited by Washington as a leading financier of Islamic militants, urged last year that a ''holy war'' be conducted against U.S. troops in his Saudi homeland.
Bin Laden has been disowned by his family and stripped of Saudi citizenship.
The advisory said the embassy continues to receive reports indicating possible surveillance of U.S. military and government facilities, ''suggesting that possible terrorist action against U.S. interests in Saudi Arabia'' is planned.
It termed ''a period of concern'' the upcoming annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. It noted that the pilgrimage, or hajj, which attracts more than 2 million Muslims from around the world, places a heavy burden on Saudi security forces.
The 10-day pilgrimage starts about April 8.
