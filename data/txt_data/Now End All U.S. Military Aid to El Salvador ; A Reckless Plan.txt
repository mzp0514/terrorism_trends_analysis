To the Editor:
In advocating ''A 50 percent Solution for El Salvador'' (editorial, May 10), you have done a great disservice to the cause of peace and democracy, which you ostensibly support.
The House Democratic plan to cut military aid to El Salvador by 50 percent rewards the terrorist Farabundo Marti rebel movement, or F.M.L.N., for launching its bloody offensive last November and has the effect of punishing the Salvadoran Armed Forces for fully supporting President Alfredo Cristiani's patient search for peace.
By ignoring positive incentives for reform and remaining silent on F.M.L.N. terrorism and economic sabotage, the Democratic plan sends the worst possible signals to extremists in El Salvador.
Under the Democrats' approach, even if the Salvadoran Government convicted all those responsible for the Jesuits' murder, purged the military of all corrupt, incompetent and brutal officers, reformed the judicial process, and the F.M.L.N. assassinated President Cristiani and his cabinet, 50 percent of American military aid would be slashed. Rather than ''ingenious and sensible,'' the Democratic plan is disingenuous and reckless.
