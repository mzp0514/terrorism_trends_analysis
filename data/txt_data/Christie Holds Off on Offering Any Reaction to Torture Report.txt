Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who was appointed United States attorney for the state by President George W. Bush in the weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks, seemed not eager on Wednesday to discuss the Senate report on the brutal American interrogation techniques used on terrorism suspects a decade ago.
Asked for his reaction by The New York Times, Mr. Christie said, "All I've seen, unfortunately, at this point, is some of the reporting from your newspaper, so I don't think it would be responsible to comment based only on that."
He said of the report: "I'll take some time to look at it. I don't know about all of it. But I'll take some time to get briefed on it for sure."
Mr. Christie has spoken out against torture in the past, saying in 2002 that "I cannot believe, given the history of this country, that no matter what the threat to our country, that we would forsake our protection of liberties to the extent that we would advocate torture as a way of getting evidence."
Asked whether he was comfortable with the interrogation techniques he had read about so far, Mr. Christie declined to say. "I'm not going to comment based just on what I've read so far," he said. "It would be irresponsible."
Mr. Christie spoke Wednesday morning after a wreath-laying ceremony honoring veterans on Ellis Island.
