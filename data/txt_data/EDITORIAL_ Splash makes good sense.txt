Sep. 29--Missouri Treasurer Sarah Steelman made a big splash when she announced plans to invest a slice of state money in a unique international index fund that screens out companies with ties to governments that support terrorism.
The splash makes good sense for a statewide Republican with a promising political future. You don't need a pollster to figure out that Missourians oppose nations that support terrorism.
The policy, however, also makes good sense. State governments should avoid investing in governments that support terrorism. The idea is apparently catching on, reportedly, with our treasurer testifying in several states interested in copying the policy.
Most importantly, the new policy works financially. The special international fund yielded a 28.05 percent return in its first 12 months of operation, according to the Associated Press, which concluded July 31. Those earnings exceeded the benchmark return of 23.91 percent in the MSCI EAFE Index, which tracks changes in stocks in 21 foreign countries and includes the companies excluded from the Missouri fund for having terrorism ties, the AP reported.
The money comes from the Missouri Investment Trust, which consists of taxes on athletes and entertainers who perform in Missouri. The money is earmarked to support various cultural programs across the state, according to the AP. And while it is a relatively small slice of state money (about $5 million), Ms Steelman is also pushing a college savings plan with a component that also avoids companies with ties to terrorism-supporting governments.
It is great when sound politics translates into good policy.
