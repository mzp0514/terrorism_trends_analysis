RISK MANAGERS owe the now-adjourned Congress thanks for approving the most important risk management legislation of the past two years-an extension of the federal terrorism insurance backstop before the program expired. But that was nearly a year ago, and Congress left some significant risk management-related issues unresolved. 
Hopes had been high that lawmakers would be able to pass legislation streamlining the regulation of reinsurers and surplus lines insurers and perhaps approve a measure creating a new Office of Insurance Information within the Treasury Department as well.
Both measures enjoyed widespread support from risk managers, insurers and brokers, and the surplus lines and reinsurance reform measure passed the House with ease. But the snowballing financial market crisis shoved both matters off the legislative stage during the final days of this Congress.
The enactment of the seven-year extension of the federal terrorism insurance program was a signal achievement and one that makes it easier for risk managers and insurers to sleep at night. We hope that the new Congress that convenes in January will move swiftly and decisively on those items on the risk management agenda that fell by the wayside as the credit crisis took center stage.
