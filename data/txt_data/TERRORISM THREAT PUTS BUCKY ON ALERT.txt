Badger red isn't the color on the minds of Camp Randall security officials as they prepare for today's football game against Northern Illinois.
Orange is the color they're worried about.
That's why fans can expect traffic restrictions and vehicle searches near the stadium today.
On Tuesday, Attorney General John Ashcroft and Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge announced a "Level Orange" alert, meaning intelligence officials believe there is a high risk of a terrorist attack.
On Friday, UW-Madison Police Chief Susan Riseling announced that security would be heightened around Camp Randall in response to the terrorist threat.
"There needs to be a different level of response," Riseling said in announcing that last year's football season security measures, put in place after Sept. 11, are back in effect.
Those security measures include searching all vehicles that are parked in the lots closest to the stadium or are driven on Breese Terrace for weapons and explosives. That street will be shut down for much of the day.
Before the orange alert, Mayor Sue Bauman and others criticized restrictions on Breese Terrace, saying that it is not reasonable to search local residents who drive on the street.
Some neighborhood residents said the measures are disruptive but they're glad the threat is being taken seriously.
"It's kind of an inconvenience but I understand they have security measures they have to take," said UW-Madison senior Jill Beattie, 21, who lives on Chadbourne Avenue.
