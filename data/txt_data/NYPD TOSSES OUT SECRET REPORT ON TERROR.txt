OOPS.
The NYPD carelessly threw out an internal "terrorism intelligence report" and the top page was spotted in the gutter outside a Staten Island police station.
The Sept. 29 analysis discussed the bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad, Pakistan, and a similar attack on the U.S. Embassy in Sana'a, Yemen, three days earlier.
"The attacks in Yemen and Pakistan employed tactics previously seen in sophisticated terror attacks conducted by Al Qaeda and affiliated violent Islamic extremists," the analysis concluded.
Details cited in the document, however, had already been reported in newspaper accounts from around the globe, according to a review by the Daily News.
The single page was found outside the 120th Precinct stationhouse near where the cops take their trash.
At the bottom of the "sensitive" document was a reminder that it "may not be distributed to members outside the NYPD without expressed consent of the Intelligence Division. All copies must be destroyed upon completion."
"While the information is not classified and from public sources, the analysis of it was compromised more by publication in the Daily News than by being inadvertently discarded," said Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne.
