The Army West Point Marathon team hosted the eighth annual West Point Fallen Comrades Half Marathon Sunday at West Point.
The community event is in honor of fallen graduates who have died in the Global War on Terrorism. Thirteen chosen graduates were honored at each mile marker of the half marathon.
The West Point Marathon team coordinated the entirety of the half marathon, working tirelessly all week to mark the course, block roads, set up tents and tables, and run through rehearsals to make sure it all went smoothly.
There were 608 participants during the partly sunny, 35-degree, 13.1-mile race event.
The race was a multipurpose event, serving as a run for West Point cadets and the general public, a ruck for some Sandhurst teams and a "Star" meet between the Army West Point Marathon  and Navy Marathon teams.
Though the course entailed a challenging, hilly route, the posters of fallen comrades at every mile marker inspired each runner to continue to give their best effort.
Class of 2018 Cadet Aaqib Syed remarked, "those hills take everything out of you but you have to remember that you're running to honor their sacrifice."
Class of 2020 Cadet Murray Johnston said, "(the race) is always a challenge, but it's a privilege to host it in honor of our fallen comrades."
This year was the first year that the Fallen Comrades Half Marathon was also hosted as a "Star" meet to race against Navy.
"We have some great competition from Navy that really allows us to test our speed against theirs," Johnston said.
Even with the difficult course, many members of the West Point Marathon team improved their personal-best times, which helped win the meet against Navy.
Syed led the West Point team and won the race overall, setting a new course record of 1:12:08.8. On the female side, Class of 2018 Cadet Paige Dougherty was the first of the Army team to cross the line, with a time of 1:30:54.0.
The top three Army-Navy males and females were:
Male:
1. Syed (1:12.08.8)-Army
2. Michael Wegner (1:15:50.2)-Navy
3. Murray Johnston (1:16:41.5)-Army
Female:
1. Dougherty (1:30:54.0)-Army
2. Cara Robinson (1:32:18.1)-Navy
3. Emily McKinney (1:36:05.5)-Army
Overall, 15-year-old Morgan Johnson, with a time of 1:30:41, won the female race.
Army won the meet based on total time of the top three male and female runners from each team. The Army West Point team had roughly a 20-minute faster combined time.
