The British government revealed sweeping plans Thursday to toughen terrorism laws, including a proposal to hold suspects for up to 42 days without charge.
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith's plan would increase the limit for detaining suspects without charge to 42 days from 28 days and urge judges to impose stiffer sentences on criminals whose offenses are linked to terrorism.
The proposal also calls for creation of a special national database to store DNA samples from suspected terrorists.
Current laws allow top law enforcement and customs supervisors to authorize the covert collection of DNA from suspects.
Human rights groups oppose proposals to increase the maximum time terrorism suspects can be held by police, as do lawmakers within Prime Minister Gordon Brown's Labour Party, guaranteeing a major fight in Parliament.
Smith said in an interview on British Broadcasting Corp. radio that the detention period had to be extended because the severity of the terrorist threat has often forced police to act before they had all the evidence needed for a conviction. "It's growing in scale. It's becoming more complicated in nature," she said. "People need to intervene earlier because of the way in which it aims to cause mass casualties with no warning."
Opponents of the changes - including Britain's chief prosecutor - claim no evidence has been produced to support an extension of detention limits.
