A SHORT PLAY ABOUT 9/11
Opening: Playwright Dominic Orlando was in New York on that tragic day, wandering in a daze and wondering if his brother was alive. This play, he said, came to him shortly thereafter, "Unplanned, as a way to process the attacks, to understand my role, and the role of art and community, without losing my sense of playfulness or humor." The work follows three characters -- a talk-show host who told a joke too early, a Russian chemist who can't stay sober while discussing terrorism and a young girl who thinks the faces on "Missing" posters might be her own. Orlando directs a Workhaus Collective cast that includes David Hanbury, Laurel Armstrong, Luverne Seifert and Craig Johnson. (8 p.m. Sat.-Mon., Thu.; Playwrights' Center, 2301 E. Franklin Av., Mpls.; suggested donation $18, 612-332-7481, ext. 20, or brownpapertickets.com.)

CAT'S PAW
Opening: Playwright William Mastrosimone mixed eco-terrorism and media manipulation in this mid-1980s play. A terrorist holed up in his warehouse hideout summons an eager TV news anchor to be the conduit for his worldwide message. The script predates the Unabomber, the Oklahoma City bombing and 9/11, yet contains incidents and ideas from each one of these. David Beukema plays the terrorist, and Katherine Kupiecki is the TV journalist. Carin Bratlie directs the Theatre Pro Rata production. (7:30 p.m. Sat., Mon., Thu.; 3 p.m. Sun.; Gremlin Theatre, 2400 University Av., St. Paul; $14-$41, 612-874-9321 or info@theatreprorata.org)

RUMORS
Opening: Urban Samurai produces this 1988 Neil Simon play. It's a mad farce set at a dinner party and involving gunshots. Stories conflict, miscommunication abounds and doors are slammed. That's about all you need to know. Matthew Greseth directs a cast that includes Urban Samurai regulars Nate Hessburg and Marcia Svaleson. (7:30 p.m. Fri.-Sat., Mon., Thu.; Sabes JCC, 4330 W. Cedar Lake Rd., Mpls.; $10-$16, 612-524-5825 or urbansamurai.org.)
