A former Navy sailor arrested two weeks ago was indicted Wednesday on charges of supporting terrorism by giving a suspected terrorism financier secret information about the location of Navy ships and the best ways to attack them.
Hassan Abujihaad was charged with one count of providing material support to terrorists with intent to kill U.S. citizens and one count of disclosing classified information relating to the national defense.
Abujihaad, 31, was arrested March 7 in Phoenix, where he apparently was working as a delivery man, and is expected to appear in court Friday. Messages seeking comment were left Wednesday with his attorneys.
The classified information involved a Navy battle group scheduled to move from California to the Middle East in the spring of 2001 to engage in missions against al-Qaida and the Taliban, according to the indictment. The material included a drawing of the group's formation when it was to pass through the Straits of Hormuz, which links the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman, at night under a communications blackout, the indictment states.
The investigation began at an Internet service provider in Connecticut and followed a suspected terrorist network across the country and into Europe and the Middle East.
