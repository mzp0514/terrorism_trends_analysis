A week of unprecedented urban fighting in the wild tribal belt of North Waziristan has left scores dead and forced thousands to flee their homes. The situation raises the stakes in Pakistan's war on Islamic militancy along the Afghan border.
A jumbled alliance of foreign militants, local tribesmen and Islamic students eager for jihad have stepped up resistance in a region where the army claims to have wiped out al-Qaida as a viable fighting force.
The unrest, brewing for months, is a setback to the U.S.-led war on terrorism. Further hampering that effort are deteriorating relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan over Afghan claims that Taliban leader Mullah Omar is hiding in Pakistan and suicide bombers are training there. 
Gen. John Abizaid, who heads U.S. Central Command, visited both countries this week, hoping to patch up the differences and put the alliance against terrorism back on track.
Western diplomats say growing lawlessness in Pakistan's tribal regions could provide more cover for militants launching cross-border attacks into Afghanistan.
The situation is a major headache for Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who has staked much on his campaign to rid the country's semiautonomous tribal regions of foreign militants. His efforts have left him facing sharp criticism at home from those who brand him an American puppet.
Musharraf has deployed 80,000 troops and mounted a series of military operations over three years into Pashtun tribal domains that have resisted outside control for centuries.
