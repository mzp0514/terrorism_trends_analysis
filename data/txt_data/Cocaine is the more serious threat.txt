Editor: Re Madeira Beach's sobriety checkpoint produces 2 arrests,    Nov. 22.
 
     The very quintessence of incongruity leapt from the pages of the    Nov. 22 City Times and Independent. 
The story about a roadblock    conducted by Madeira Beach law officers followed an account of crack    cocaine traffic moving into quiet, residential St. Petersburg    neighborhoods (Crack and its dealers spoiling residential areas).
 
     Reportedly, 168 motorists were pulled over, apparently on suspicion    of DUI. Two, so the story goes, failed the field sobriety test and were    arrested. The lead story was a tale of horror and sheer terrorism in a    large section of St. Petersburg. Strong men, it was told, are afraid to    venture into the streets at certain hours. Women and children live in    fear of being caught in the crossfire as dope-crazed gunmen shoot it    out in neighborhood streets. Perpetrators of these and other vicious    acts of terrorism seemingly ply their dope-trafficking trade boldly in    plain view for all to see - even the police.
 
     Yet, day after day, the same illicit activity continues unchecked.
 
 Outdoor dope centers - "crack holes," as they are called - appear in    first one residential neighborhood and then another while pushers and    customers thumb their noses at police.
 
 
   I am in no way condoning drunken driving, but I just can't help    wondering why police can't or won't use the same zeal in apprehending    the culprits who inflict terror upon innocent citizens to the point    that they are hostages in their own homes as they do in rounding up DUI    suspects.
