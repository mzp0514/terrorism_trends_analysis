Speculation regarding terrorism has focused on America's energy grid. An attack on a power plant or transmission line could have devastating consequences. Dominion has launched a campaign to enlist customers and others in the defense of the country's power supply.
Its version of Neighborhood Watch asks people to report suspicious activity near a Dominion site by calling 1-800-684-8486 or, in the event of an emergency, 911. The company identifies seven signs of terrorism: surveillance - recording or monitoring activities, possession of a Dominion facility blueprint; information gathering - trying to gain information about Dominion facilities or people working there; testing security - seeing how long it takes emergency responders to arrive at a scene; acquiring supplies - purchase or theft of explosives or weapons, or the storage of hazardous chemicals or equipment; people who don't belong - people who do not seem to belong in the workplace, neighborhood or business establishment or who demonstrate odd behavior; dry run - a practice session of a terrorist attack; deploying assets/getting into position - signs that terrorists are prepared to strike.
 The signs may occur months or years before a formal attack. People must act when their suspicions are aroused. Dominion devotes considerable resources to protecting its plans and its lines; its efforts also protect the general public. We have confidence in the company. And we are reminded that security begins at home.
