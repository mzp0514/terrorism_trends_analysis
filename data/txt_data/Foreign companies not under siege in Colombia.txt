To the editor: I was dismayed and saddened to read the Sept. 2 article on terrorist insurance in Columbia, "Coverage Scarce in Terror-ridden Colombia," wherein comments attributed to me have contributed to a very negative and misleading impression of the real situation in this country.
I wish to point out that that coverage, including terrorist risks, is offered by most local insurers (with reinsurance placed in international markets when required) for both national and multinational companies operating in Colombia.
Rates for the coverage vary, and deductibles, even for oil companies, begin as low as $ 5,000 per occurrence.
The article suggests that foreign companies and their employees are virtually under siege here and that is simply not the case.  Your correspondent fails to mention that Colombia's young president, Cesar Gaviria, and his government team are much admired for having successfully eliminated narco-terrorism and for their persistent efforts to reach a peaceful solution to the guerrilla groups' activities.
Nor is there any mention of the general level of renewed optimism in the country following this year's introduction of a new constitution coupled with wide-reaching reform to the economic, political and legal systems.
Thank you for allowing someone who lives and works very happily in Colombia to briefly describe the true picture.
