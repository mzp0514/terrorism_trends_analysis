"We have a long preoccupation with terror," said Wilmoth during a
speech to the West Virginia Bar Association's annual convention. "I'm
not talking about Stephen King; I'm talking about terrorism."
America's history is highlighted with terrorist acts, from John
Brown's raid on the arsenal in Harpers Ferry in 1859 to the unrest
during the civil rights movement, he said.

Justice Information Services division in Clarksburg.

Marshall Richards Jr., spent more than 16 months investigating the
militia and Looker.
Looker was convicted last August of conspiring to manufacture and deal
in explosives.  He received an 18-year sentence.  sentence.  sentence.
