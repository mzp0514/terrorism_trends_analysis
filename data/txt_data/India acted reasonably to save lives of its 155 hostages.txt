Editor, New Era:
How dare you criticize India so severely for the deal it negotiated with terrorists! What callousness!
India was in a terrible situation with such a large number of hostages' lives at stake.
#EISERER.LET7#They did what they had to do to save those lives -- 155 totally innocent people. If India had tried to use force, as you suggest by your idealization of Entebbe, 155 innocent people might well be dead right now. Would you then be praising India for its refusal to negotiate with terrorists?
You say (New Era, Jan. 5) that "U.S. counterterriorism policy is simple and straightforward." What baloney! A short time ago, America's President pardoned a dozen terrorists who were then released from prison. This was despite the objections of the nation's law enforcement community, and the vast majority of analysts agree that Clinton's motive was to help the political ambitions of his wife.
Citizens of a country so debase that it releases terrorists for domestic political ambitions do not have the right to criticize another nation that releases terrorists in order to save 155 innocent lives.
Each act of terrorism has to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. Only a fool would think that Entebbe can be recreated every time terrorists take hostages, and yet that is what you so glibly imply. Sure, there have been successful raids on terrorists in hostage situations. But there have been horrible failures as well.
We should take every step to prevent terrorism before it happens, and we should enforce swift capital punishment on any terrorist who is captured. But to potentially sacrifice 155 innocent lives just to take a tough posture on terrorism? You're crazy!
