Security forces tracked down and killed 17 Islamic militants Sunday and Monday in one of the deadliest encounters in nearly two years of civil strife, the authorities said today.
Eleven more have been killed in five smaller operations over the last two days, officials said.
The major raid took place in the Djebel Bouzegza area, 40 miles east of Algiers. The authorities said security forces had seized hunting rifles and automatic pistols.
The Interior Ministry reported Monday that security forces killed four suspects during operations that led to the release of three kidnapped French diplomats over the weekend. A fifth suspect was arrested, and four others were being sought, the ministry said. Police and hospital officials had said that at least six suspects were killed in the hostage release.
The ministry identified two of the suspects still at large as men sentenced to death in absentia for acts of terrorism. The last hostage to be freed was given a message by her captors threatening foreigners in Algeria.
Since late September, Islamic militants have been blamed for the deaths of seven foreigners. More than 2,000 people have died since January 1992, when the Government canceled elections that the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front was expected to win. A crackdown led to a retaliatory campaign of bombings and assassinations.
