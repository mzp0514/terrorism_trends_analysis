The Greek police have been put on alert around the Athens airport and at American military bases and airlines offices here amid fears of terrorist attacks, a senior police official said today.
The fears involve Palestinian threats over concerns that Greece may extradite a Palestinian wanted by the United States.
A Greek Government official confirmed the alert order. Greek officials said there had been anonymous calls threatening terrorist attacks if extradition is granted.
Officials said that the Athens diplomatic mission of the Palestine Liberation Organization had reacted strongly to legal developments this week involving the Palestinian, Mohammed Rashid, who is 35 years old.
 
Special Vehicles and Police Units
The United States wants Mr. Rashid to face charges in connection with the bombings of two American airliners in flight in which a total of five people were killed.
The officials said armored vehicles and special police units were stationed around the Athens airport, the offices of American airlines and United States bases.
An Athens court this week dismissed Mr. Rashid's claim that he had been mistaken for someone else.
It proceeded with the extradition hearing, but then postponed it until Sept. 5 at the request of Mr. Rashid and to get additional documentation.
Mr. Rashid, who was arrested in Greece and charged with traveling under a false passport, has admitted to being a supporter of the P.L.O. He is wanted by the American authorities in connection with the attacks on the airliners in 1982 and 1986.
