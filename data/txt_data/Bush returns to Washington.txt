WASHINGTON - President-elect George Bush arrived back in the capital    Sunday to prepare for the inauguration after a three-day fishing trip    to the Florida Keys. Bush did not stop to talk with reporters before    departing Marathon, or on board Air Force Two. 
He had said Saturday he    planned to resume work on his inaugural address Sunday night.
 
 
 KGB to join West against terrorism   
 
 JERUSALEM - A Radio Moscow statement aired here Sunday quoted the    deputy chief of the KGB as saying the Soviet service would work with    the American, British and Israeli intelligence agencies to fight    terrorism. The offer, believed to be unprecedented, was attributed to    Lt. Gen. Vitaly Ponomarev, second-in-command of the Soviet security    service.
 
 
 King is remembered in church sermons   
 
 The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was remembered from the pulpit by    fellow clergymen Sunday as a man whose "spiritual genius" and    Christian faith inspired a rebirth of freedom. Although today is the    official national holiday in his honor, the slain civil rights leader    was hailed in sermons and speeches Sunday, the day he would have turned    60. In his hometown of Atlanta, King's widow, Coretta Scott King,    delivered the annual "state of the dream" speech at Ebenezer Baptist    Church, where King preached. President-elect George Bush plans to mark    the holiday at an ecumenical prayer breakfast organized by the    Inaugural Afro-American Committee. King was assassinated April 4, 1968,    in Memphis, Tenn.    Heart report: Good    news, bad news
