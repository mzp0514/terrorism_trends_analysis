FIVE AMERICANS who plotted to aid the Taliban could spend the next decade in a Pakistani prison.
The Sargodha Five, as they've come to be called for the city in Pakistan where they were nabbed, were convicted yesterday on terrorism and other charges.
All are from the Washington, D.C., area and in their 20s. And all were tried by a single judge in a special court closed to observers - at a speed rarely seen in a country where terrorism trials drag out for years.
Khalid Farooq, whose son Umar is one of the convicted men, vowed to appeal the verdict "to the International Court of Justice."
"I have not had a chance to see my son or the other fellows," he said. "I hear they are very frustrated and need to be consoled."
An immigrant from Pakistan who lives in Alexandria, Va., Farooq said his son was in Sargodha to get married and the others were invited to the ceremony. He said some of them intended to help orphans across the border in Afghanistan - not fight U.S. forces.
Prosecutors contend they have e-mail records and witness statements proving they plotted terror attacks in Pakistan against American targets.
The Pakistanis have also flatly denied the suspects' claims they were tortured by police and the FBI.
The other imprisoned American citizens are Ramy Zamzam, who is of Egyptian descent, Waqar Khan, who is Pakistan-born, and two Ethiopian immigrants, Aman Hassan Yemer and Ahmed Minni.
