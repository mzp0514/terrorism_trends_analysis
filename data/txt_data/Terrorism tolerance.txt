The United Nations' condemnation of terrorism depends largely on who is doing the terrorizing, as events in Iraq and Gaza demonstrate. 
Flavia Pansieri, deputy high commissioner for human rights, recently documented atrocities by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. And the U.N. Human Rights Council is calling for an urgent fact-finding mission in Iraq to investigate alleged war crimes. 
But Hamas in Gaza? These terrorists fly under the U.N.'s radar, with nary any U.N. response "‚Äù even after the execution of 18 suspected "spies" for Israel by black-hooded thugs. 
With regard to ISIS, Ms. Pansieri reported "acts of inhumanity and on an unimaginable scale." A Human Rights Council resolution condemned ISIS 10 times. But a July resolution on Gaza ignored Hamas entirely. The same resolution criticized Israel 18 times, "even though Jerusalem took unprecedented measures to avoid harming civilians" in response to Hamas missile attacks, according to unwatch.org. 
What's revealed isn't a lopsided worldview. It's a prejudicial perspective that turns a blind eye to Hamas terrorism, which is no different than what ISIS is doing in Iraq and Syria. 
Yet for six years, the United States has remained a party to this unforgivable tolerance as a member of the despicable Human Rights Council. That's no longer imprudent. It's intolerable.
