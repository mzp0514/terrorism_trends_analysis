Obama administration officials are reassuring an irate Iran that new U.S. visa waiver restrictions intended to sort out potential terrorists won't jeopardize the nuclear agreement with the Islamic republic. 
Restrictions apply to dual citizens of Iran, Syria and other countries linked to terrorism and for travelers who have visited those countries in the last five years, The Hill newspaper reports. This drew fire from Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who insists that the change somehow infringes on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear accord with the United States and five other world powers. 
But the change does not bar travelers to Iran from entering the U.S.; it adds the requirement that they obtain visas. And this supposedly discriminates against a country long known as the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism? 
Secretary of State John Kerry assures that changes to the Visa Waiver Program will not interfere with the "legitimate business interests of Iran," suggesting that the restrictions can be waived. 
So even more appeasement is heaped on while Iran thumbs its nose at a U.N. Security Council resolution by recently launching two ballistic missiles. 
Given Iran's behavior of late and the Obama administration's incessant kowtowing, the nuclear accord is not worth the price that's being paid for it.
