European leaders today generally supported President Clinton's bombing raids in Sudan and Afghanistan, and even those who appeared uneasy defended the right of a country to counter-attack terrorists.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, one of the United States' most consistent allies, was among the President's effusive supporters today. The German Government "supports all measures to combat terrorism," he said, adding that governments must be united on such issues.
Leaders from most other Western European nations, among them Britain, Spain and Austria, all characterized the American attacks as justifiable and appeared ready to believe Washington's assertions that the strikes were a response to overwhelming evidence it had amassed of planned terrorist attacks.
Even France, which has quarreled repeatedly with the United States over the threat of military action against Iraq, seemed ready to support the White House. Though the French Foreign Ministry issued a somewhat chilly statement this morning that it had "taken note" of the missile attack, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin was more explicitly supportive.
"Wherever terrorism is launched from, we must respond with a decisive and firm answer," Mr. Jospin said.
Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, praised the United States. "I hope that everyone will understand that the U.S.A. must have the right to defend itself against terrorism," he said while on vacation today in the south of France.
