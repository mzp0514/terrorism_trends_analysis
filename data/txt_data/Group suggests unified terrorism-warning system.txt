A unified, national system to warn the public of terrorism threats and natural disasters is needed to help save lives, reduce disaster losses and speed recovery, according to a study released Monday.
The many government agencies issuing warnings are inconsistent in their terminology, leading to confusion and inadequate response, according to the study by Partnership for Public Warning.
In its report, "Developing a Unified All-Hazard Public Warning System," the group encourages the federal government to develop a national all-hazard public warning system with agencies, state and local governments, universities and other groups.
The development of such a system, the report said, should consider 60 years of social science research on how people respond to disaster warnings and how warnings can be made more effective.
Mass panic is highly unlikely when accurate information is provided, the study said.
People rarely respond effectively to a last-minute, out-of-the-blue alert to take action unless they can directly perceive the threat, the study said.
Partnership for Public Warning's report stemmed from a Department of Justice request for public comment earlier this year on a proposed homeland security advisory system.
The public/private nonprofit group promotes effective public warnings and information about national security threats and natural disasters.
