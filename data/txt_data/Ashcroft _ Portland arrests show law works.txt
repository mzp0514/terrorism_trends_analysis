PORTLAND - A terrorism suspect in custody in Oregon said he failed to raise money locally for a "jihad" trip overseas because potential donors were terrified of being arrested, Attorney General John Ashcroft said Tuesday.
"Our strategy and methods are working," Ashcroft told the Judiciary Committee in the U.S. Senate, where the Portland case was cited as an example of the Bush administration's success in the war on terrorism, and the success of new anti-terrorism laws such as the USA Patriot Act.
Five native-born Muslims are in jail in Portland awaiting trial on charges of conspiring to wage war against the United States. The FBI says they tried to travel from Portland to Afghanistan in the fall of 2001 to fight on the side of the Taliban. They made it as far as China, court documents say.
One reason they weren't more successful was lack of money, said suspect Jeffrey Leon Battle, according to secretly recorded conversations. Ashcroft read the transcript in Congress on Tuesday.
"Everybody's scared to give up any money to help us," Ashcroft quoted Battle as telling the informant last May.
"You know what I'm saying, because of that law that Bush wrote about, you know, supporting terrorism, whatever, the whole thing.  Everybody's scared," Ashcroft quoted Battle as saying.
"They are getting the message," Ashcroft said.
