A 1993 gunfire rampage at a five-star hotel in Cairo was a terrorist act that could have been prevented, a lawyer for the widows of two victims of the attack told a Manhattan jury yesterday.
Lawyer Harvey Weitz said the gunman shouted "Allahu Akbar" (God is Great) after the Oct. 26, 1993, bloodbath at the InterContinental hotel.
"He was there to kill Westerners," Weitz said in an opening statement in Manhattan Federal Court.
The gunman, Saber Farahat, killed four people who were dining in the hotel's restaurant, overlooking the Nile.
The victims included Robert Guidi, 47, of Rahway, N.J., and Coby Hoffman, also 47, of Edison, N.J., two engineers for a subsidiary of Brooklyn Union Gas (now KeySpan).
Their widows are suing the hotel, claiming that lax security enabled Farahat to slip past guards with a gun strapped to his body.
Washington lawyer Merrill Kramer, 49, who was with Guidi and Hoffman on business, also is suing. He was critically wounded in the attack.
Defense lawyer Alan Kaminsky said Egyptian authorities determined that Farahat was not a terrorist but a "lone madman."
"This case is not about terrorism," he told the jury.
Farahat was found mentally incompetent and was later released from a mental institution, Weitz said.
In 1997, armed with gasoline bombs, he attacked a bus loaded with tourists, killing nine Germans and their Egyptian driver. He was caught and executed.
Karen Guidi and Eve Hoffman consoled each other as they heard the killings of their husbands recounted.
"It's much more emotional than I thought," said Guidi, 56. "I thought I was ready for it, but I'm not."
The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, was filed in 1995.
