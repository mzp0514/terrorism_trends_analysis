A top State Department official said today that Yasir Arafat's statement in Stockholm recognizing Israel and denouncing terrorism was a step in the right direction, but that it did not clear the way for peace negotiations.
The official, Richard W. Murphy, Assistant Secretary of State for Near East and Southeast Asian Affairs, said the Palestine Liberation Organization leader's statement after a meeting with a delegation of American Jews did not go far enough.
''Yesterday in Stockholm, Arafat took the process another step forward,'' Mr. Murphy said at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ''Still, he fell short of the mark, but the progress is in the right direction and again is welcome.''
Mr. Arafat said the P.L.O. accepted the existence of the state of Israel, while continuing to attach conditions like discussion of United Nations resolutions on the Palestinian question at an international conference, which the United States has called unaceptable.
At his news conference tonight, President Reagan said the time was not yet ripe to make moves toward discussions with the P.L.O., saying the Arafat statement was not the ''clean-cut'' pledge that Washington had expected.
Mr. Murphy also said that for peace negotiations to begin the Palestinians must ''clearly and unambiguously'' tackle the issues of terrorism, the recognition of Israel's right to exist and Resolutions 242 and 338.
