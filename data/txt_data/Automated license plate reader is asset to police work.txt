Oct. 10--Corning Police Department will be one Mobile Automated License Plate richer due to funding through a Homeland Security Grant, reported Corning police Chief Jeremiah Fears during Tuesday's City Council meeting.
Fears said the grant, facilitated through Tehama County as an Anti-Terrorism Body, funds law enforcement needs such as planning, equipment, training exercises and administrative costs.
"One source of technology available that is useful in tracking, locating and ultimately recovering stolen vehicles, is the Automated License Plate Reader," he added. "The readers have proven to be an effective tool in monitoring possible stolen vehicles and criminal activity."
The city already has license plate readers located at specific locations in town which have proven beneficial and successful in alerting police to possible stolen vehicles traveling in the community.
"In addition," Fears said, "the installation of an automated license plate reader can assist in the protection of our infrastructure and key resources, and enhance the ability to locate suspects who could potentially pose a threat to public safety."
The new mobile automated license plate reader will be place on the department's newest patrol vehicle at a cost not to exceed $14,735 in grant funding.
Members of the City Council voted unanimously to approve the purchase.
"This is a great piece of equipment for our community," Councilman Dave Demo said.
