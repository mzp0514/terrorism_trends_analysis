More Muslims should denounce Islamic terrorism
Your recent front-page article "Our Kids Are Not Terrorists (and we don't want them to fall prey to terrorists)" was a very appropriate and important reminder that most Muslims are good people that just want their children to be successful like all of the rest of us do.
A reader couldn't help but feel sympathy for Muslim parents and their kids who face a very tough problem. Anybody who has worked with Muslims and has been to Muslim nations knows that the vast majority of Muslims are good people who just want to lead good lives. But obviously, there are also radical Muslim terrorists that are killing innocent people around the world in the most barbaric ways possible.
The solution for the majority of good Muslims to reduce the public's distrust is to publicly and aggressively denounce radical Muslim terrorists and their distorted version of Islam. President el-Sissi of Egypt, who is a devout Muslim, bravely laid out that road map by declaring that Muslims need to essentially declare war on those radical Muslim terrorists and their evil ways.
As el-Sissi said, Muslims need to be respectful of all faiths and not impose their faith on anyone. If the vast majority of good Muslims took the lead in denouncing radical Islamic terrorists, they would dramatically enhance the respect and trust in their communities, and their neighbors would know that we are all on the same side.
