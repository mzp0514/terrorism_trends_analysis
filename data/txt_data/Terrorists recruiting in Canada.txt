A CANADIAN imam warns that the Great White North is becoming a recruiting hotbed for radical Islamic terrorists.
Syed Soharwardy, the founder of Muslims Against Terrorism, denounced the militant Islamic State (ISIS) as "deviant people" who betray the true beliefs of the Muslim faith."
"They are using Islam, they are quoting Koran, they look like Muslims, they pray like Muslims - but they are not Muslims," Soharwardy told CBC News.
"They are doing exactly everything which goes against Islam."
Yet groups like ISIS are finding success in luring fighters to join them in Iraq, Syria and other hot spots.
"It's terrorism, and in Canada they have successfully recruited more than 100 people," the imam said.
"Absolutely I am convinced that this recruitment is going on right here in this country," Soharwardy told the public television station. "Under our noses. In our universities, in our colleges, in our community."
Canadian intelligence officials recently estimated the number of its country's citizens fighting with ISIS at 130.
Soharwardy's comments came a day after Islamic terrorists threatened Chicago and Washington D.C., on Twitter. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security issued a bulletin Friday urging all local officials to be on the lookout for possible ISIS threats and homegrown terror.
