TO THE EDITOR: Once again, a letter writer confuses individual responsibility with the responsibilities of groups, classes or whole nations, and, in so doing, reaches a dangerous and immoral conclusion. Wayne Merris suggests that the next time terrorists strike in the West, The countries they come from should be told one more time and we will nuke you.
#712438.wrk#Did he say nuke, as in use massively lethal nuclear weapons to kill tens of thousands of innocent people in nations with which we are not at war? Will incinerating much of Saudi Arabia or Syria or Jordan quell the terrorist threat? Does he really believe that is a prudent, decent and effective response to terrorism, or is he just exaggerating for effect? Merris says we are taking a knife to a gun fight, and he concludes that nuclear weapons would work better. Imagine the world if the Indians and Pakistanis thought that way. The Taiwanese would be a tad uncomfortable if the Chinese thought that way. American citizens in Alaska would quake if the North Koreans thought that way. Havent we learned that weapons of mass destruction are not to be taken lightly? The countries where terrorists come from are not our enemies. In most cases they themselves are deeply affected by terrorism. British authorities have suggested it is likely that citizens of the United Kingdom were involved in the recent underground bombing. Should the British nuke themselves? The terrorism threat is real and requires vigilance and action. But suggesting that Americans should incinerate thousands of innocents to serve as a deterrent is positively scary. Michael Billig, Lancaster
