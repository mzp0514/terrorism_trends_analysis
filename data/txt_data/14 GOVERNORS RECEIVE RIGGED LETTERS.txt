Envelopes containing matches that were rigged to ignite when opened have been received through the mail at the offices of at least 14 state governors in the past two days.
 The mailings, under investigation by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, bear a return address that names two inmates at a maximum-security prison in Nevada.
But a Nevada corrections official said it was unclear whether they were the actual senders.
 Aides to several governors, including Massachusetts' Mitt Romney, said they had been told by the FBI that the case was being treated as one of domestic terrorism, and Jennifer Meith, a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Fire Marshal's Office, said that was her understanding as well.
 But spokesmen for the bureau declined to comment on a current investigation, although one of them, Joe Parris, said in Washington, "Cases of this nature are generally handled by the local domestic terrorism squads" -- that is, the joint terrorism task forces set up by the FBI in cities across the country. Because of the Nevada connection, the case is being handled by the bureau's office in Las Vegas, Parris said.
 No one has been injured, although 23 staff members in the office of Montana Gov. Judy Martz were evacuated Thursday after one of them opened the envelope sent there. It ignited briefly and then petered out, Martz spokesman Chuck Butler said.
 Not all the envelopes have been opened. Once warnings about them began to spread, some were kept unopened, to be turned over to investigators./
