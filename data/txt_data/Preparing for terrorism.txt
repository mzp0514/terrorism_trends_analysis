* Wherever you are, be aware of your surroundings. The very nature of terrorism suggests there might be little or no warning.
* Take precautions when traveling. Be aware of conspicuous or unusual behavior. Do not accept packages from strangers. Do not leave luggage unattended. Unusual behavior, suspicious packages and strange devices should be promptly reported to the police or security personnel.
* Do not be afraid to move or leave if you feel uncomfortable or if something does not seem right.
* Learn where emergency exits are located in buildings you frequent. Notice where exits are when you enter unfamiliar buildings. Plan how to get out of a building, subway or congested public area or traffic. Note where staircases are located. Notice heavy or breakable objects that could move, fall or break in an explosion.
* Assemble a disaster supply kit at home and learn first aid. Separate the supplies you would take if you had to evacuate quickly and put them in a backpack or container, ready to go.
* Be familiar with different types of fire extinguishers and how to locate them. Know the location and availability of hard hats in buildings in which you spend a lot of time.
