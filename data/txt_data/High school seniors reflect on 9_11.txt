Sept. 11--"I was just shocked that something that big had happened and I just didn't know about it." -- Veera Shah, senior, BHS South. She first learned about 9/11 when she was six, and heard about it from a family member.
"Now that 9/11 has happened, it puts everybody else more on edge and more serious about the topic, that it could happen again ... Not necessarily everything that happens in our country is an act of terrorism ... (but) when something bad happens, everybody always flocks to, 'It's an act of terrorism.'" -- Emma Lashley, senior, BHS South
"I think the most I ever hear about 9/11 is when I watch the news with my parents, like CNN. They always do 'The Day of 9/11,' a ton of remembrance stuff, way more than we do at school." -- Mia Trueblood, senior, BHS South
"I feel like I probably didn't fully understand why it happened. I didn't understand the terrorism side of it." -- Mallorey Daunhauer, senior, BHS South, on learning about 9/11 in elementary school
"I think this was the first year, or maybe it was last year, where in history class we learned about 9/11 as an event that occurred before we were born. I think schools are just starting to talk about that." -- Robbie Gonyea, senior, BHS South
"What my parents have talked about is if I'm traveling--not necessarily that specific event, but that is a thing that happens now. Terrorism is something you have to pay attention to." -- Haley Byrnes, senior, BHS South
