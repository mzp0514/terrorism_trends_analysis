Body


A soldier with Pittsburgh connections was killed in a helicopter crash near the Iraqi city of Najaf during a battle with militants, the Department of Defense announced Tuesday. 
Capt. Mark T. Resh, 28, grew up in Fogelsville, Lehigh County, but moved to Pittsburgh to attend college. He graduated in 2001 summa cum laude with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Pittsburgh's School of Engineering, according to university records. 
Resh and Chief Warrant Officer Cornell C. Chao, of California, died Monday about 100 miles south of Baghdad while providing air support to Iraqi troops battling a messianic Shiite cult known as the "Soldiers of Heaven." 
The battle started when units of the Iraqi police, military and paramilitary national police went to the group's hideout 12 miles north of Najaf early Sunday to arrest cult members on the suspicion that they were preparing to attack pilgrims during Tuesday's festival of Ashoura. The fight escalated, and U.S. troops moved in to support the Iraqi soldiers and police. 
The battle lasted nearly 24 hours and ended after U.S. and British jets pounded the cult's positions with rockets and 500-pound bombs. About 250 cultists were reported killed in the firefight. 
Resh and Chao were serving as pilots with the 4th Battalion, 227th Aviation Regiment, 1st Air Cavalry Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division out of Fort Hood, Texas. 
Resh entered the Army in May 2001 and deployed to Iraq in September 2006. 
His awards and decorations include the Air Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary, Global War on Terrorism Service, Army Service Ribbon and Army Aviation Badge. 
Resh's family couldn't be reached for comment.
