People everywhere seem to be hardening their hearts toward terrorism. The hijackers of the Kuwaiti airliner now in Algeria might once have won sympathy from Moslem extremists and played on concern elsewhere for their hostages' lives.
Now, after nine days, there seems to be a rising realization that the only way to protect future travelers is to refuse the hijackers' demands of the present.
Meanwhile it is the Kuwaitis who, by refusing to yield to gruesome extortion, have grown in the world's respect, while the P.L.O.'s Yasir Arafat and Iran vie with each other to denounce the taking and killing of hostages. The hijackers demand release of 17 prisoners convicted in Kuwait for 1983 bombings that wrecked the U.S. and French embassies, killing six. Kuwait has refused to budge, even though the hijackers dumped bodies of two Kuwaitis on the Cyprus tarmac. The hijackers next threatened to kill themselves and their passengers, then settled for a swap of 12 lives for fuel plus the right to land in Algiers. With 32 passengers still at their disposal, the cold-blooded bargaining continues.
A wise rule for appraising acts of terrorism is not to generalize; every circumstance has its own openings. But there's a constant underlying presumption: Resist, for concessions may lead to more hijackings and more hostage-taking. Those who seized the Kuwaiti plane are now murderers, seeking freedom for other murderers. To give them that victory by capitulating to the hijackers' demands would foster more terror.
The more chastening, therefore, to recall that during the Iran-contra scandal the Reagan Administration was trying to curry favor with Iran by promising to free the same Kuwaiti prisoners. Tiny Kuwait now sets a braver, wiser example.
