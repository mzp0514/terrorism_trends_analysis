The will to kill remained strong last week in the Middle East.  Would-be assassins in Beirut set off a car bomb that missed Prime Minister Shafik al-Wazzan, on his way to work, by seconds.
The will to kill remained strong last week in the Middle East.And in the occupied West Bank, Palestinian assailants grabbed an Israeli student's machine gun and stabbed him to death as he stood in Hebron's open-air market.
Israeli military authorities accused Hebron's acting mayor of encouraging terrorism, dismissed him and cordoned off the city center but 100 Jewish settlers, defying a military curfew, burned vegetable stands and smashed shop windows. When Defense Minister Moshe Arens visited the scene settlers, who blamed the killing on his policy of relaxing controls, cried ''murderer.'' Next day in Jerusalem, troops fired in the air to disperse 200 stone-throwing Arab youths shouting support for Yasir Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organization leader.
The violence died down in Lebanon's Bekaa district where warring Palestinian factions alternately observed and violated a cease-fire.  Mediators shuttled between Tunis, where Mr. Arafat rejected demands to share power with Palestinian rebels, and Damascus, which backs the rebellion. The P.L.O. leader accepted appointment of committees to audit spending and check on whether the organization's decisions are properly executed. Even more to the point, Mr. Arafat planned a trip to Moscow, hoping the Soviet Union would put pressure on the Syrians.
