A Senate panel on Thursday voted 2-1 to pass a bill that would crack down on "eco-terrorism" attacks against mining, agriculture and timber-harvesting companies.
House Bill 206, addressing a much-feared but little-used tactic, cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee, headed by Sen. Craig Taylor, R-Kaysville, after some debate.
It passed the House by a 41-31 vote last week and now goes to the full Senate for consideration.
The bill would increase penalties for crimes committed in the name of environmental protection, or "monkey-wrenching."
Rep. Dennis Iverson, R-Washington, who sponsored the bill, said his intent was to protect Utah's three "basic industries" by enhancing penalties that are "so low . . . prosecutors can't impose penalties stiff enough."
Though he voted for it in his panel Thursday, Taylor said he wondered if the bill was part of a worrisome trend.
"If we do this, I'm wondering why don't we just enhance every area of the criminal code and we'll be able to say we're being tough on crime," he said. "We'll have to pump another $ 200 million into our prisons."
Ann O'Connell, of the Audubon Society of Utah, testified the bill could unfairly punish those practicing milder forms of environmental protest like civil disobedience.
Sen. David Buhler, R-Salt Lake City, opposed the bill, saying the state Sentencing Commission should study it and there was no explanation how prosecutors could prove criminal intent in such cases.
The House debated whether to make the bill apply to all industries or only to violent crimes, but decided against those proposed changes.
