In the shameful process of reviving the Export-Import Bank under the multiyear highway-funding bill, House apologists for crony capitalism also axed an amendment prohibiting the Bank of Corporate Wealthfare from providing loan guarantees and credit to state sponsors of terrorism. Namely Iran. 
The measure was pooh-poohed by opponents as redundant with other laws; it was rejected 244-183. Trouble is, those existing prohibitions are subject to presidential waivers, The Washington Free Beacon reports. And "we have seen the president abuse waivers to pursue his agenda over and over again on Iran no matter what Congress thinks," said House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, R-Calif. 
Iran is one of three state sponsors of terrorism identified by the State Department. The Islamic republic has made clear its intent to purchase commercial aircraft from Boeing "” Ex-Im's frequent customer "” and Airbus, its European competitor, The Free Beacon reported. 
And according to the Congressional Research Service, Mr. Obama can waive "four different executive orders prohibiting Export-Import Bank financing of Iranian purchases of U.S. goods," The Free Beacon reported. Never mind Iran's "long history of using its commercial airlines to support its terrorist proxies," Mr. Royce reminded. 
It's tragic to think that our "leaders" are this stupid.
