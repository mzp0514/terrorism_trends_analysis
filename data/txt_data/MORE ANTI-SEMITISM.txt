The International Court of Justice's rendering of the security fence in Israel "illegal" is just one more demonstration of the rampant anti-Semitism that is poisoning the world ("Israel Fence Said Illegal," July 10). The fence was put up in defense of Israeli citizens to prevent terrorists from infiltrating the country and killing its citizens.
The ICJ's recommendation to tear down the fence is an invitation to more terrorism and murderous homicide bombings. Since the fence has been under construction, fewer attacks have been perpetrated by Palestinian terrorists.
 The message that readers may receive from the Post-Gazette placing this story on the front page is that Israel is behaving in a manner defying world opinion. It is essential that Israel do all it can to protect itself, because if it knuckles under to the opinion of countries swayed by pro-Palestinian terrorist ideologies, it will not exist.
 The world should support Israel's need to protect itself and objectively evaluate the true cause of the Arab-Israeli conflict, that being Palestinian terrorism and anti-Semitism. Until these issues are addressed and terrorism ceases, all sovereign democracies (Israel included) will find it necessary to do whatever they require to protect their citizens' right to exist in peace.
