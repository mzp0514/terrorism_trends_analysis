House Speaker Dennis Hastert has formed a task force to combat drug trafficking, which he called the financial engine that drives many terrorist organizations.
"By going after the illegal drug trade, we reduce the ability of these terrorists to launch attacks against the United States and other democracies," Hastert, R-Ill., said at a news conference Friday.
The 48-member Speaker's Task Force for a Drug Free America will advise Hastert on national drug policy and ways to reduce the demand for illegal drugs. Reps. Rob Portman, R-Ohio; John Mica, R-Fla.; and Mark Souder, R-Ind., will co-chair the panel.
"The role that we have to play here is to be sure that U.S. money, through people using illegal drugs in the United States, is not being used to subsidize terrorism," Portman said.
Afghanistan, the country harboring suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden, is the world's largest producer of the opium poppy, which is used to make heroin.
"The illegal drug trade is the financial engine that fuels many terrorist organizations around the world, including Osama bin Laden," Hastert said.
After the news conference, Asa Hutchinson, administrator for the Drug Enforcement Administration, joined task force members for a briefing on the connection between drug trafficking and terrorism.
