Corrections that appeared in print on Thursday, Dec. 31, 2020.
FRONT PAGE
An article on Tuesday about a German officer who faces terrorism charges described incorrectly the location of Baustarring, a Bavarian hamlet. It is 250 miles east of Franco A.’s former army base, not 250 miles west.
TRACKING AN OUTBREAK
An article on Wednesday about the first case of a highly contagious coronavirus variant found in the United States included outdated information about a couple in Canada who tested positive for the variant. Health officials there said on Sunday that the couple had been in contact with a visitor from the United Kingdom; it is not the case that they had no known exposure.
BUSINESS
An article on Dec. 22 about Google’s response to the Justice Department’s accusations that it violated antitrust laws misstated the number of states that had sued Facebook on antitrust claims. It was 46, not 40.
