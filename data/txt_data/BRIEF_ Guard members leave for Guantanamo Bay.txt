Jan. 09--About 40 airmen from the 139th Civil Engineering Squadron left Rosecrans Memorial Airport Monday morning on the first leg of a six-month deployment to Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
The base supports the ability of U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships, along with ships from other allied nations, to operate in the Caribbean. The facility also supports the Department of Homeland Security in migrant and terrorism operations.
While at the Navy base, the men and women of the Missouri Air National Guard will be part of a larger force supporting general improvements, engineering, infrastructure construction, project management and other support activities for Guantanamo's Expeditionary Legal Complex and Camp Justice.
Fellow members of the 139th Airlift Wing provided breakfast Monday for the departing airmen and their family members.
Although this is the first deployment for squadron members to Guantanamo, several airmen have repeatedly deployed over the past 10 years to Afghanistan and Iraq. The Airlift Wing has routinely flown missions throughout the Caribbean and South America during the last two decades.
