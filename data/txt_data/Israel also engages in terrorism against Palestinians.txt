Editor, New Era:
As we fight our own war against terrorism, Israel employs their own terroristic actions to rid "their land" of the Palestinian threat.
The terroristic highway flows both ways (as most things do), but why does American policy continue to support a state that uses as much terror, violence, and destruction as its counterpart (Palestine)?

Is it because we have clung so adamantly to Israel for so long that we are now indifferent to their increasingly violent and disturbing actions? Is it because we view this action as militaristic in nature and therefore exempt from the label "terrorism"? Is it because Palestinian deaths are not headlined along with the words "suicide bombing"?
Are the people in Palestinian towns that have been shelled not as equally terrorized as the Israelis who own shops in shrapnel-strewn strip malls? If the answer is yes, maybe we need a revamped definition of terrorism.
Countries can change (Germany for example). People can change (anymore CIA support to Osama?). So naturally enough situations can change. Why don't we just throw away that old rule book and start over, this time with a more objective point of view?
President Bush said we must eradicate terrorism from the earth.  Maybe the powers that be should digest some of their own advice.  Next stop -- Israel.
