Six terrorism suspects arrested last month and accused of plotting to attack the Fort Dix army base were indicted Tuesday by a federal grand jury in New Jersey.
Five of the six were charged with planning to kill U.S. military personnel, an offense that carries a potential life sentence.The sixth defendant was charged with a weapons offense that carries a maximum 10-year term.
All six have been held without bail since being arrested May 7.
The arrests last month capped a 16-month investigation by the FBI and the South Jersey Joint Terrorism Task Force.
The indictment charges that five of the defendants, Mohamad Shnewer, 22, Serdar Tatar, 23, and brothers Dritan Duka, 28, Shain Duka, 26, and Eljvir Duka, 23, "were inspired by" al-Qaida, "a foreign terrorist organization" and planned an "armed paramilitary" attack on Fort Dix.
The Duka brothers are Cherry Hill, N.J., residents who came to the U.S. from the former Yugoslavia as children in the 1980s. They are ethnic Albanians, and authorities say they are currently illegal aliens.
Shnewer, also of Cherry Hill, is a U.S. citizen who was born in Jordan and came to this county as a child. Tatar, formerly of Cherry Hill but now living in Philadelphia, is a legal resident alien who was born in Turkey.
The sixth defendant, Agron Abdullahu, 24, of Atlantic County, N.J., was charged with aiding the Duka brothers in possessing weapons. He came to the U.S. with his family from Kosovo in the late 1990s.
