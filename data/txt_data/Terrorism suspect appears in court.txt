NEW YORK (AP) - An Algerian man alleged to be an accomplice of Ahmed Ressam, who is accused of smuggling explosives into the United States, was ordered held without bail Friday as authorities ended a nationwide sweep linked to the case.
Assistant U.S. Attorney David Kelley told U.S. Magistrate Judge Ronald L. Ellis that 31-year-old Abdel Ghani was living in the United States illegally.
He portrayed Ghani as eager to assist Ressam in raising money for the terrorist organization for which Ressam was allegedly transporting explosives.
An FBI criminal complaint said Ghani was apprehended after his name and telephone number were found on a piece of paper belonging to Ressam.
Russ Bergeron, spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said about 15 individuals were either arrested or held under administrative detention procedures after interviews were conducted in a number of states. The detentions were mainly related to immigration violations, although the interviews were connected to the Ressam case, authorities said.
FBI spokeswoman Anita Dickens said no further interviews were under way Friday and authorities would now concentrate on any leads resulting from the initial interviews.
Ressam was arrested Dec. 14 in Port Angeles, Wash., on explosives smuggling charges after he allegedly tried to smuggle RDX, a powerful demolition explosive, and timing devices into Washington from Canada.
Ghani was charged with concealing his support for Ressam's efforts to violate federal explosives laws and with conspiring with others to traffic in and use fraudulent credit cards and bank cards.
