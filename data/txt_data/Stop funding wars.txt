There are many reasons to oppose the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, one of the most obvious being the diversion of resources from the needs that are so apparent here at home. But the most compelling argument may be that the wars, rather than being in the interest of national security, only put us at greater risk.
The Defense Science Board Task Force commissioned by Donald Rumsfeld in 2004, in reviewing the impact of our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan on terrorism and Islamic radicalism, concluded that the underlying sources of threats to America's national security and what most exacerbates anti-American sentiment, and therefore the threat of terrorism is American intervention in the Muslim world, and "the American occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan."
The House of Representatives has the authority to stop funding the wars.  According to polls, it is a fact that the majority of the people oppose these wars. It also is a fact that nearly 5,000 of our troops have been killed and tens of thousands severely wounded. And it is a fact that hundreds of thousands of Afghan and Iraq civilians have been killed and wounded.
If we believe the wars are contrary to our national security, that many innocent lives are being sacrificed by these occupations, that our wounded soldiers should be healed and our active troops used more wisely, and that our tax dollars are needed at home, shouldn't our elected representatives hear us?
