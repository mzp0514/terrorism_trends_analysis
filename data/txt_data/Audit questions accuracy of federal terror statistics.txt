The Justice Department has routinely misrepresented the number of terrorism prosecutions, possibly undermining decisionmaking in the war on terrorism, an independent government audit found.
The report, released Tuesday by the Justice Department's inspector general, concluded that the department in most cases "could not provide support for the numbers reported or could not identify the terrorism link used to classify statistics as terrorism-related."
All but two of the 26 statistics reviewed from October 2000 through September 2005 were wrong. "These inaccuracies are important because department management and Congress need accurate terrorism-related statistics to make informed ... decisions," Inspector General Glenn Fine said in the report.
Part of the problem, according to Fine, was that the Justice Department routinely counted criminal cases as terrorism- related even when prosecutors had found no links to terrorism. Fine also blamed a "decentralized and haphazard" system.
Some in Congress have accused the department of manipulating the statistics to claim success in the war on terrorism.
Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd said the inaccuracies found from 2002 to 2004 resulted partly from the reorganizations of the Justice Department and the FBI after 9/11. Since then, terrorism-case reporting has improved, he said.
