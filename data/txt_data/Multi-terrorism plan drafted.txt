The Clinton administration plans to transfer 500 agents to the FBI's counterterrorism force to offset the threat of simultaneous terrorist acts, The Wall Street Journal reported today.
The administration plans to notify Congress of the reassignments soon, possibly later this week, although Clinton does not need congressional approval, according to a senior federal law enforcement official quoted by the newspaper.
The move comes as the bureau investigates three high-profile cases of apparent or possible terrorism: the June 25 truck bombing that killed 19 U.S. airmen in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, the July 17 explosion of TWA Flight 800 that killed 230 people, and the July 27 pipe bombing in Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park that killed a woman and injured more than 100.
The transfer "assumes demands on resources that we've seen in the last couple of months" will continue," the official said. "This is a new reality for us."
FBI Director Louis Freeh told Congress last month that with an increased counterterrorism workload, "we are being spread very thin. We could double the amount of people we have in our counterterrorism program and probably still not be where we need to be if this current trend continues."
The number of agents currently assigned to the counterterrorism unit is classified, but the reshuffle from other FBI units would still significantly strengthen that force, the newspaper said.
