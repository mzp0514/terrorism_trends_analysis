Biological agents are living organisms, or the toxins made from them, that cause disease or harm to humans.
Culturing biological agents is relatively easy, though making them into weapons is relatively difficult.
Organisms chosen for biological warfare are typically infectious but not contagious, so that only a relatively few organisms have been weaponized, according to the Virginia Department of Emergency Services.
As a result, dispersing biological weapons is the main technical challenge to a biological terrorist. Terrorists, however, do not have to be selective in choosing biological agents, the department warned.
Because of the latency period between exposure and the onset of symptoms, just one person's movements could spread the effects of a bioterrorist attack widely.
Since the early symptoms of illnesses from most weaponized biological agents look like those of normal diseases, even recognizing that a bioterror attack has occurred can be inordinately difficult.
Among the biological agents usable as terrorists weapons are:
* anthrax, found in sheep;
* smallpox;
* tularemia, or rabbit fever;
* cholera;
* encephalitis;
* plague and
* botulism.
Toxins are among the most deadly chemicals known. Some that could also be used by a terrorist organization are:
* staph enterotoxin B, found in improperly stored cooked meat;
* alpha toxin;
* ricin, derived from castor beans;
* saxitoxin, found in shellfish;
* tetrodotoxin and
* tricothene mycotoxin.
