WASHINGTON (AP) - A top banking regulator told Congress Thursday the failure of a California bank that was secretly owned by the Bank of Credit and Commerce International will cost $130 million to $140 million.  John W. Stone, director of the Supervision Division of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., said at a Senate hearing it's not certain whether taxpayers will have to cover some of the loss.
He said the FDIC hopes to recover some of the money from a special fund of forfeited BCCI assets.  At the same hearing, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said there may be a fifth U.S.  bank with ties to foreign-owned BCCI, which pleaded guilty to federal racketeering charges earlier this year and agreed to forfeit a record $550 million in U.S. assets.  Regulators disclosed last year that BCCI had secretly acquired three U.S.  banks and a substantial stake in a fourth.  One of the three, Independence Bank of Encino, Calif., failed and was seized by federal regulators in January.  The FDIC has spent around $535 million to pay Independence depositors, and the agency holds bank assets worth an estimated $397 million, Stone told the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on terrorism, narcotics and international operations.
