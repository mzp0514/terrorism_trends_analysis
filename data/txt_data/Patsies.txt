A century of history apparently isn't enough to drive a lesson home.
The Obama administration's appeasement of the Castro regime in Cuba was meant to improve conditions there. Last January the White House eased travel restrictions. Near the end of the year it opened the door to a prisoner swap to exchange Bill Gross, an American falsely accused of spying, for Rene Gonzalez -- who helped Cuba shoot down two civilian planes on a humanitarian mission in 1996.
Along the way the administration also offered to remove Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism, and to cut back efforts at promoting democracy in the island gulag, among other things.
So how's that been working out?
Cuba arrested nearly twice as many political dissidents last year (4,123) as it did the year before (2,074). Nearly 800 arrests were made in December, after the prisoner-swap outreach. Castro's murderous and repressive regime not only continues to violate the most basic principles of human decency with impunity, it does so with increasing frequency.
That should come as no surprise. Anyone with even a passing knowledge of U.S.-Soviet history knows trying to woo Communist thugs with sweetness and light is a fool's errand. But then anyone with that kind of knowledge probably has little influence these days with the patsies at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.
