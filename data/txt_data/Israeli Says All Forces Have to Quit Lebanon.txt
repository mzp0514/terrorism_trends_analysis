Defense Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel was quoted today as saying that all Palestinian and Syrian forces down to the last man would have to leave Lebanon for Israel to agree to withdraw.

BONN, July 10 (Reuters) - Defense Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel was quoted today as saying that all Palestinian and Syrian forces down to the last man would have to leave Lebanon for Israel to agree to withdraw.
''As long as the P.L.O. exists in Beirut there will be no strong and independent government in Lebanon,'' he was quoted as saying.  ''Our demand means that all foreign troops down to the last man must leave the country -the terrorists, the Syrians and ourselves.''
He accused European criticism of Israel's invasion of hypocrisy.  ''I have rarely heard these Europeans reacting quite so violently to the murders of the P.L.O.,'' he said.
He said Israel had uncovered evidence that Lebanon was the world center of terrorism with almost all terrorist organizations receiving training and weapons there.
