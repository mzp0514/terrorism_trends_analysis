There were fewer international terrorist attacks last year than any other year since 1969, the State Department said yesterday, although it didn't include most of the violence in Iraq.
 Though Bush administration officials frequently refer to Iraqi insurgents as terrorists, most attacks in Iraq were not considered international terrorism because they were directed at combatants.
"Increasingly, the line between insurgency and terrorism has been blurred by anti-coalition attacks that have included suicide car bombings at police stations, an Italian military police base and the headquarters of the International Red Cross," the State Department said in its annual terrorism report.
 The 181-page Patterns of Global Terrorism Report offered a country-by-country review of attacks and cooperation in fighting terrorism.
 In its introduction, the State Department's top counterterrorism official, Cofer Black, cited Saudi Arabia "as an excellent example of a nation increasingly focusing its political will to fight terrorism."
 Al-Qaida "is no longer the organization it once was," Black also said.
 "Most of the group's senior leadership is dead or in custody, its membership on the run and its capabilities sharply degraded."
