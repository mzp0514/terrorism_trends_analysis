EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT Hosni Mubarak's supporters have portrayed the Muslim Brotherhood as a band of Islamic fanatics who will try to turn Egypt into an anti-Western theocracy.
Experts paint a more nuanced picture of Egypt's oldest Islamic organization; they agree it wants a Koranic state, but say it opposes terrorism.
"The MB are enemies of Al Qaeda and not radicals like some other groups in Egypt," said a New York-based Egyptian human rights activist who spoke anonymously.
Despite a violent past, the group "rejected the armed struggle agenda in Egypt," he said.
The Brotherhood is no friend of Israel. Recently, a spokesman refused to commit to Egypt's longstanding peace treaty with the Jewish state.
We are "not against Jews," Mohamed Morsy told CNN. "We are against Zionism."
On its website, the Brotherhood says it takes a "middle-of-the-road intellectual line in dealing with various Islamic issues." At the same time, it "seeks to establish Allah's law in the land."
Founded in the 1920s, the Brotherhood battled British colonial rulers and Jews settling in Israel.
Later, they backed Gamal Abdel Nasser's revolt to free Egypt - but tried to kill him when he balked at forging an Islamic state. Nasser and his successors cracked down hard on the group.
The modern Brotherhood pushes a political agenda. One leader said in a 2007 interview that a name change was being considered so that the Western world would not associate it with terrorism.
