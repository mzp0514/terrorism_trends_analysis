I am disturbed greatly to hear or read of someone who maliciously has vilified our president and our country's foreign policy in a time of national emergency and in this hour of global terrorists attacks. Especially it is sad to hear this coming from a former president. Has he forgotten 9-11?
Let us all pray and pull together for an overwhelming success in Iraq. If terrorism is not dealt with a severe defeat in Iraq, it will only gain strength and spread with revived vigor to all the Middle East and worldwide, even to the U.S.A.
It is like a cancer, we must not waiver until it is removed and all trace destroyed or it will be deadly. We must not forget all the other worldwide attacks of terrorism including the most recent foiled attack on our service personnel at Fort Dix, N.J.
Remarks like that of our former president and anyone else who is negative to our president will only undermine our stability and strength.
Let us also remember that all the evil in the world originates in Satan, the master terrorist and the only way to be completely free from terrorism is to trust the giver of life and blessings Jesus Christ, the Son of the Living God. John 10- 10 John 8:32 & 36.
One day everyone will see what the name of Jesus means and stands for, however, for many it will be too late. Phil 2: 9-11. God bless our president, our country and our troops.
