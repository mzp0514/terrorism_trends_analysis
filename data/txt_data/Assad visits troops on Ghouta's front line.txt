DAMASCUS, Syria — Syrian President Bashar Assad visited troops Sunday on the front line in the newly captured areas of eastern Ghouta, near the capital Damascus, hailing their recent advances as a part of a larger battle against global terrorism. Standing in a neighborhood street, Assad congratulated his troops during the visit broadcast on state-run al-Ikhbariya TV. 
"We are proud of you," he said. He told the soldiers that they are not only fighting for the region but also to rid the world of terrorism. "With every bullet you fire at a terrorist, you change the balance in the world," Assad said. Syria's government views all its opposition as terrorists. Recapturing eastern Ghouta, a short drive away from the Syrian capital, would mark the biggest victory yet for President Bashar Assad in the country's civil war. The area has been under rebel control since 2012. It would also be the worst setback for rebels since the opposition was ousted from eastern Aleppo in late 2016 after a similar siege and bombing campaign. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the Syrian government is now in control of over 80 percent of the area. The crushing offense that began Feb. 18 has left nearly 1,400 people dead and more than 5,000 wounded and has forced tens of thousands to seek shelter in areas under government control. — Associated Press
