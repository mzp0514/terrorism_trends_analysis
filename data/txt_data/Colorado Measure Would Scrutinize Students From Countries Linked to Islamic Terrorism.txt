A bill moving quickly through the Colorado legislature would require public colleges to pay closer attention to students from countries with links to Islamic terrorism.
Under the measure, which has been approved by Colorado's Senate and by a committee in the House, colleges would have to annually verify the visa status of students from 18 countries, including Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, and the Philippines.
One of the supporters of the bill, Sen. John Andrews, a Republican, said the majority of terrorist threats come from Islamists. "We should prioritize a list of countries with demonstrated susceptibility to the virus of Islamic terrorism," he said.
Federal law already requires colleges to verify the visa status of all foreign students within 30 days of their registering for classes. As a result, several lawmakers who oppose the state measure said it duplicates existing efforts and ignores students from other countries linked to terrorism, like North Korea. "It's a political statement," said Sen. Ron Tupa, a Democrat. "It's a bad statement."
Abu-Omar Almubarac, director of a Denver-area nonprofit group that gives legal aid to Muslims, called the bill racist. "The bill would be OK if it was for all foreign students," he told the Associated Press. "There are terrorists everywhere. To point a finger at Muslims is discriminatory and hateful."
