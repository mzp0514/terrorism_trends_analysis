The locations of drugs for fighting possible biological terrorism attacks will be exempted from the public eye, but not the total amount the state holds, under a plan passed by the Florida Senate on Tuesday.
Sen. Rod Smith, D-Alachua, who co-sponsored the bill, said the exemption would protect those hospitals holding drugs that could be targeted by terrorists attempting to spread diseases to the public, such as smallpox.

"With this, we are still giving adequate information for the state citizens about the overall conditions in Florida and the amount we paid," he said.
To become law, the bill needs to be passed Thursday by the House, which has similar legislation brewing.
"No one likes to impede the access of information to the public," said Sen. Ginny Brown-Waite, R-Brooksville, chairwoman of the committee that crafted the new provisions. "But we need to remember that the availability is not just to us as citizens, but to those who wish to do the country harm."
Other changes included barring the public from viewing security plans from hospitals and the letters accompanying records requests from other governmental agencies.
If the Senate's proposed laws are not taken up by Thursday, when the emergency legislative session ends, House members will already have the proposals waiting when legislators reconvene in January for their regular session.
In addition, a proposal killed by the Senate that would have allowed the State Department of Law Enforcement to stop access for up to 21 days to any records it said were involved with terrorist investigations may be taken up during the next session."
