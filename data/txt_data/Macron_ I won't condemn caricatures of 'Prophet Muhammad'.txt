French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday it was not his place to pass judgment on the decision by the satirical magazine, saying France has freedom of expression.
The Kouachi brothers and a third Islamist gunman, who killed five people in the 48 hours that followed the Charlie Hebdo massacre, were shot dead by police in different stand-offs, but 14 of their alleged accomplices go on trial on Wednesday.

The suspects, who go on trial on Wednesday, are accused of providing various degrees of logistical support to the killers.
The trial was originally set for last spring but was delayed by the coronavirus crisis that shut down most French courthouses.
