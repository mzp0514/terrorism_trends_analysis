Closing down a Washington office of the Palestine Liberation Organization won't hurt the P.L.O. It sets a tricky precedent. And it's unlikely to advance peace in the Middle East.
So why did the Administration order the P.L.O.'s information office to cease operation within 30 days? Because Congress seemed about to vote just such an action and the President didn't want to be upstaged.
The action has no practical effect: the P.L.O.'s American supporters have the constitutional right to form their own information office. According to the State Department, the action was taken because of ''terrorism committed and supported by organizations and individuals associated with the P.L.O.'' But State concedes it has no evidence of terrorism by individuals in the office. Will the department now send cease-and-desist orders to lobbies espousing the cause of Sikhs, Basques, Irish Republicans and Tamils?
Closing down information offices is a gesture suitable to closed societies. It gives the P.L.O. a legitimate civil liberties issue and a greater claim for attention and sympathy. A court challenge and litigation are sure to follow, affording the P.L.O. a public relations windfall. Yet mindlessly, some American Jewish spokesmen believe this empty gesture strikes a blow against terrorism.
