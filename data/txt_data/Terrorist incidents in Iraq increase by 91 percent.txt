WASHINGTON - The number of terrorist incidents in Iraq - and resulting deaths, injuries and kidnappings - skyrocketed from 2005 to 2006, according to statistics released by U.S. counterterrorism officials.
Of the 14,338 reported terrorist attacks worldwide last year, 45 percent took place in Iraq, and 65 percent of the global fatalities stemming from terrorism occurred in Iraq. In 2005, Iraq accounted for 30 percent of the worldwide terrorist attacks.
The figures, compiled by the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) and released with the annual State Department Country Reports on Terrorism, showed that the number of incidents in Iraq rose 91 percent, from 3,468 in 2005 to 6,630 in 2006.
Almost all of those incidents involved the death, injury or kidnapping of at least one person. All told, the number of people killed, injured or kidnapped as a result of terrorism in Iraq jumped 87 percent, from 20,685 to 38,713.
The State Department's annual report - which included an assessment of the five years since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks - said the invasion of Iraq has brought "measurable benefits," including the removal of "an abusive totalitarian regime with a history of sponsoring and supporting regional terrorism."
Still, the report Monday acknowledged, the invasion "has been used by terrorists as a rallying cry for radicalization and extremist activity that has contributed to instability in neighboring countries."
The report also said that since the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in the fall of 2002, the country "remains threatened by Taliban insurgents and religious extremists," though "the majority of Afghans believe they are better off than under the Taliban." The number of terrorism incidents in Afghanistan rose 52 percent in 2006 compared with 2005.
