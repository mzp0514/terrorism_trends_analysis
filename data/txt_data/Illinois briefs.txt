Illinois man pleads guilty to terror charge
CHICAGO - A man from suburban Chicago changed his plea to guilty Tuesday on a terrorism charge that he tried to join an al-Qaida-affiliated group fighting Syrian President Bashar Assad`s regime.
Abdella Ahmad Tounisi, 21, of Aurora, stood in orange jail garb and spoke softly as he answered a federal judge`s questions. Several times he turned to smile at nearly 30 friends and relatives on spectator benches, including his mother and father.
Under a 14-page plea deal, Tounisi agreed to plead guilty to one count of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. In return, prosecutors will drop a second count of making false statements in a matter involving international terrorism.

Deputy Gov. Trey Childress wrote Tuesday to trustees Chairman Ed McMillan before he and the other two members of the trustees` executive committee consider the deal Wednesday.
Childress said the administration has "deep reservations" about the agreement.
