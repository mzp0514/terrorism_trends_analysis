Vice President Bush's Task Force on Combating Terrorism is expected to make its recommendations to President Reagan soon, completing a study that began this summer with the hijacking of a Trans World Airlines jet but one that has been subject to updating ever since with each new outrage of political violence. Ten ranking executives from print and electronic news organizations were invited the other day to meet with the Vice President and the panel's chairman, retired Adm.
James L. Holloway, and discuss privately what sort of a factor news coverage is in terrorism.
Some news executives were uneasy afterwards, sensing that Government officials had already judged news stories to be an aggravating and unnecessary part of the problem. A Government official who had been present insisted later that this was not the case.
On another level of the problem, Raja Shehadeh, a lawyer from the Israeli-occupied West Bank, has been visiting the United States, seeking to focus attention on factors beyond the usual instant recapitulations of the latest terrorism. Mr. Shehadeh, co-director of the West Bank Affiliate of the International Commission of Jurists, criticizes Israel's administration of the West Bank in his book, ''Occupier's Law.''
On a speaking tour sponsored by the American Friends Service Committee, he said he had discerned the beginning of attention to his thesis that the question of a Palestinian homeland must be addressed as a step in reducing terrorism. ''Americans seem aware that something is wrong, but they're not quite sure of what yet,'' he said.
