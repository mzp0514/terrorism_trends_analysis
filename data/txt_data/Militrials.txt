If you thought it would have been hard to get to the right of the Bush-Cheney administration on questions of homeland security, think again. Senate Republicans have done precisely that.
A provision of the 2012 military authorization bill would require the military to hold and try all non-citizen terrorist suspects believed to be associated with al-Qaida. This is too much even for the military. In a recent speech, Pentagon general counsel Jeh Johnson warned against "overmilitarizing" counterterrorism by extending the military's "powerful reach into areas traditionally reserved for civilian law enforcement in this country."
Not even the Bush administration pursued a military-only strategy. Officials in the previous administration recognized that the struggle against terrorism has elements of both warfare and civilian law enforcement. Last year John Bellinger III, a legal adviser to the National Security Council under George W. Bush, said the "rush to military commissions is based on premises that are not true. I think it is neither appropriate nor necessary to limit terrorism cases to either military commissions alone or federal trials alone."
A prudent approach would preserve both options and exercise one or the other depending on circumstances. Foregoing the justice system entirely also would deprive the U.S. of suspects and evidence, which some nations will not hand over except for civilian purposes. Republicans want to look tough on terror. You don't do that by renouncing a major terror-fighting tool.
