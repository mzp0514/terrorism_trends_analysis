Dear Editor: If Sen. Ron Johnson was serious about combating terrorism, he would have voted for the Feinstein amendment that would have blocked people on the terrorism watch list from buying a gun. Republicans Kelly Ayotte and Mark Kirk had the guts to defy the NRA and support measures that have 90 percent backing from voters, including Wisconsin's.
But no, Johnson did the NRA's bidding and ignored citizens sickened by America's worst mass shooting. Terrorists must be pleased to know that Johnson would allow them to buy assault rifles. Really? Does anyone believe terrorists should be allowed to buy weapons of war?
Johnson voted for a GOP substitute that would have unnecessarily handcuffed the FBI. To paraphrase his benefactor, Wayne LaPierre, that would have been as effective in preventing gun violence as using Kleenex to combat a cold. If Johnson really wants to protect his constituents, he should introduce a bill to bar assault rifles to civilians altogether. And then close the background checks loophole. Both would be constitutional. We voters will be watching.
