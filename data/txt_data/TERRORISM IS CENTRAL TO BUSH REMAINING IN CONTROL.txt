Now that the terrorist bombings in Saudi Arabia and Morocco have been attributed to al-Qaida, Americans' feeling of insecurity at home and abroad is not likely to abate any time soon.
 The recent and yet-to-be-concluded wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were sold to us, however, as necessary to prevent such violence and make the world safer.
The particulars -- in the case of Iraq that the alleged (and still undiscovered) holdings of weapons of mass destruction made Saddam Hussein an imminent danger -- are soon forgotten, if they are even bothered with in the first place.
 What often remains, then, is a pervasive fear, one that the Bush administration has been very adept at exploiting to justify both its military actions and domestic policies. One need not be a cynic to surmise that this recent terrorist violence is an essential part of the world that this administration desires. As George Orwell made clear in his novel "1984," a program of permanent war is a very effective way to render docile and thereby control the people of a nation.
 We Americans, for sure, need to see some semblance of progress in the so-called war on terror, but if Bush's approval rating of 71 percent is to continue and his re-election be assured, an identifiable, threatening enemy -- the crudely drawn Middle Eastern terrorist -- must remain.
 Unfortunately, this probably means a continuation of simplistic but pleasingly "patriotic" analyses of complex world problems and more military posturing and actions that will do little to solve them.
