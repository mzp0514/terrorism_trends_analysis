I am disturbed by what is clearly a double standard in the media's reporting regarding two terms: "weapons of mass destruction" and "terrorism." Such a double standard is unethical; it represents attempts to brainwash and cause readers, viewers and listeners, such as myself, to distrust all of their reporting.
The media use the term "weapons of mass destruction" to refer to, I assume, nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. This term is used consistently when talking about individuals or governments who may be opposed to U.S. government interests. Never have I heard or seen it used to refer to these very same weapons possessed by the United States government or its allies, such as the United Kingdom or Israel.
Similarly, acts of political violence intended to intimidate or subjugate against the United States or our allies are often called "terrorism," while acts by the U.S. government or its allies against other governments or individuals, even if the same kind of act, are not called "terrorism."
In essence, media reporting suggests "they" have weapons of mass destruction and engage in terrorism, while "we" do not have these weapons and do not commit acts of terrorism, even though the weapons and actions are the same or remarkably similar.
I hope the Bangor Daily News and other media will stop this double standard and start reporting the "news" in a way that is more informational, rather than propagandizing. Many media watchers I have spoken with know what is going on and have lost respect for the media because of it.
