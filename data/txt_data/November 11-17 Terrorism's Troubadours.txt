     The Sept. 11 attacks have filtered into popular culture everywhere, even in corridos, the twangy ballads of northern Mexico. The music of corridos is traditional, but their lyrics tell gripping, contemporary tales: the exploits of borderland drug lords, say, or the travails of migrants to El Norte. Following are translated excerpts of two of the most recent.   SIMON ROMERO

"Black September"
By Filogonio Contreras
Black 11th of September of our year 2001
Like castles of playing cards
Thus fell the potent twins
Erasing thousands of innocent lives.
They destroyed the two towers
So central to finance. . . . 

It seemed like a nightmare
Both women and men were crying.
Bodies were covered in flames
And were jumping from windows.

Another plane in Pennsylvania
Crashed in an empty field
Everyone was burnt 
With courage they resisted.

"The Ballad of Osama bin Laden"
By Rigoberto Cardenas Chavez

I am not God to judge you
You have your motives
Money seeks money
And the gringos want you
Like a treasure they are seeking
They will be made rich if they find you.

Nostradamus had foreseen it
A dragon has risen
The beginning of the end of the world
Is what we're watching unfold
The most perverse animal on Earth 
Is the human being.
