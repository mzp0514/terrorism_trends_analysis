Under Fire
Frustration over the Indian Government's struggle to end the violence in Punjab state exploded in sharp attacks against Prime Minister Indira Gandhi last week. Opposition politicians in Parliament demanded her resignation.
Members of her own Congress-I party joined in calling for swift action to end terrorism and rioting between Sikhs and Hindus and within the Sikh community. More than 150 people have been killed in the last nine weeks.
Mrs. Gandhi promised not to let concern about maintaining her popularity with voters inhibit stern reprisals against terrorism. Her Government dispatched hundreds of paramilitary and police officers to reinforce local authorities, extended curfews and arrested more than 170 suspects after bombing attacks set fire to 37 rural railroad stations.
Sikh terrorists were blamed for the slaying in Chandigarh of Inderpal Gupta, a shopkeeper and local president of the newly formed Hindu Protection Committee. A police subinspector and a constable were shot and killed by youths as the fighting spread into the neighboring state of Haryana, which Sikh militants want reunified with Punjab.  Inside their walled fortress-headquarters in the Golden Temple at Amritsar, rival Sikh factions posted guards armed with automatic weapons around their respective headquarters buildings. Harchand Singh Longowal, the leader of moderate Sikhs, accused the Government of encouraging quarrels among Sikhs to weaken their campaign for political and religious autonomy.
