   The basics of national security letters:
In 1986 Congress first authorized the FBI to obtain electronic records without approval from a judge.
Such demands for information, known as national security letters, can be used to acquire e-mails, telephone, travel records and financial information, including credit and bank transactions. They can be sent to telephone and Internet access companies, universities, public interest organizations, nearly all libraries, financial and credit companies.
Originally, the FBI could only get records of people suspected of being agents of a foreign power. In 1993, the authority was expanded to cover records of anyone suspected of communicating with foreign agents about terrorism or espionage.
The Patriot Act in 2001 eliminated any requirement that the records belong to someone under suspicion. Now an innocent person's records can be obtained if FBI field agents consider them merely relevant to a terrorism or spying investigation. By the numbers:
The estimated number of national security letters requested by the FBI, 2000-05. Each letter may contain one or more requests for information.
2000: About 8,500
2003: 39,346
2004: 56,507
2005: 47,221
Total 2003-05: 143,074
Justice Department auditors found that delays in recording national security letter requests, as well as database flaws, caused the FBI to significantly underreport its totals to Congress. At least 8,850 requests were missing from the database between 2003 and 2005.
