The United States is planning to reject an application by a team of Libyan athletes to compete in the World University Games in Buffalo, N.Y., next week, officials and lawyers said yesterday.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher has urged the Treasury Department to withhold licenses the Libyan athletes need because their government is a sponsor of terrorism, said an administration official.
Libya is under strict U.S. sanctions over its alleged support for terrorism, and has been under a United Nations air and weapons embargo since last year over its refusal to hand over two suspects in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
The 79 athletes and support staff have applied for U.S. visas and their required Treasury licenses at the U.S. embassy in Malta, said a U.S. official. Although they have not yet received official refusals of their applications, a decision to reject the applications already has been made in Washington, said one official.
The State Department considers the athletes an entity of the Libyan government, although their lawyer, Dan Press, said they were university students and not working for the Libyan government.
Organizers of the games contend they were led to believe the United States would allow all countries wishing to participate to enter the country -- similar to a promise given by former President George Bush to organizers of the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.
''We hope the State Department will follow long-standing precedent for amateur athletes and consider these athletes on an individual basis for purposes of entry into the United States,'' said David Zook, a lawyer for the organizers.
