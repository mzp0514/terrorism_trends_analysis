WASHINGTON -- The Clinton administration continued to express
concern about possible holiday terrorist incidents Tuesday as
security was tightened at American airports and for U.S. military
forces abroad.
The State Department, reiterating its warning Dec. 11 to U.S.
holiday travelers abroad, released new details about a thwarted
attack on Americans in Jordan.
Administration officials again said they have no evidence of any
specific terrorist threat at home. They said they were walking
a fine line between responsibly advising the public and creating
a panic.
"We have told the American public (traveling abroad) that this
is a yellow light; it is not a red light," State Department spokesman
James Foley said.
Developments:
-- The Federal Aviation Administration said travelers should
expect tightened security at airports.
-- The Pentagon said U.S. military commanders worldwide have
been put on alert.
-- The State Department issued its second caution for Americans
abroad in two weeks. A statement Tuesday said 13 suspected terrorists
arrested in Jordan this month were considering attacking Americans
there.
Though that operation was foiled, the statement said, the department
"cannot rule out the possibility that attacks still may be planned
for this and other parts of the world."
-- In Vermont Tuesday, investigators were trying to determine
whether explosives might have been stored in a car carrying an
Algerian man who was held Monday by federal agents at a tiny border
station.
The investigation comes after the arrest last week of Algerian
Ahmed Ressam, who was charged with transporting explosives.
The two incidents were not believed to be related.
