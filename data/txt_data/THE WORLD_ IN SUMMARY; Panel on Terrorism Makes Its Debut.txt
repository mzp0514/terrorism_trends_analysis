Senator Jeremiah A. Denton, Republican of Alabama, has promised to invite people with varied views of Soviet behavior, including advocates of unilateral disarmament, to testify before his new subcommittee on security and terrorism. The witnesses at the committee's first hearing last week all declared that Moscow is a key supporter of terrorism, and Senator Denton strongly endorsed their view.

Two witnesses also asserted that the Soviet K.G.B. had successfully deceived Western opinion through so-called disinformation -planting false information. Former Newsweek correspondent Arnaud de Borchgrave went further, saying he had ''irrefutable proof'' that Moscow had infiltrated the antinuclear lobby in the United States through links between a Soviet front organization and a group called Mobilization for Survival. He didn't say what the proof was.
Concern that exactly that kind of charge would be made led many liberals and civil libertarians in and out of Congress to oppose the subcommittee's formation. Mobilization for Survival said Mr.  Borchgrave's testimony was ''reminiscent of the intimidation of the McCarthy era'' and asked Senator Denton to bar from the record ''any further unsubstantiated charges.''
Organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union are also concerned that the committee, operating under its ''security'' mandate, will advocate lifting restrictions on Government surveillance of domestic groups.
