Dec. 29--     Dec. 29--The U.S. Senate this month moved forward with a bill that, if passed, will guide operations at the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility, a federal animal disease lab under construction in Manhattan.
Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., presented the amended National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility Act of 2019 on Dec. 17. The bill is intended to outline how the facility should operate once it's complete.
The document was placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar under General Orders.
The $1.25 billion facility is a Biosafety Level 4 lab under construction at the north end of the K-State campus. It's intended to replace the Plum Island Animal Disease Center in New York.
The scheduled date for the lab to be operational is 2022 or 2023.
According to the bill, the lab's purpose is "to provide integrated research, development, test and evaluation infrastructure, and response capabilities for defending the United States against bio- and agro-terrorism threats."
The bill mandates at least a biennial (every two years) evaluation and strategic research plan with the secretaries of Agriculture, Homeland Security and other relevant heads of agencies.
The bill says the strategic research plan will be unclassified and published in a format that is publicly available.
It also specifies a report to several congressional committees every six months.
