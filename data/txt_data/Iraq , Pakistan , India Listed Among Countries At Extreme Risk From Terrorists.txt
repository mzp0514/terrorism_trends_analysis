(RTTNews) - A Terrorism Risk Index (TRI) developed by global risks analyst Maplecroft has rated Iraq as the most dangerous country for the second consecutive year.
The global ranking, revealing the countries most at risk from terrorist attacks, was developed by Maplecroft for companies to assess terrorism risks to their international assets.
The index measures not only the risks of an attack, but also the chances of mass casualties occurring.
Thailand has slipped into the extreme risk category for the first time.
Surprisingly, the findings of the study conducted by Maplecroft indicates the Western countries are comparatively safer from terrorist threats.
All but one of the the top 10 countries in the world most at risk from terrorist attacks are either from Asia or Africa.
Iraq is followed by Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Lebanon, India, Algeria, Colombia, Thailand, and the Philippines among a list of 162 countries rated.
Russia and Nigeria are rated as high risk countries, while Britain, China, USA, and France are considered medium risk countries. Germany, Canada, and Australia are found to be at low risk of terrorist strikes.
Maplecroft says it prepared the Terrorism Risk Index after analyzing terrorist incidents every six months for their frequency, intensity, number of victims, and the proportion of attacks that were &apos;mass-casualty&apos; in each nation. A country&apos;s historical experience of terrorism was also considered along with threats made against it by groups such as al-Qaeda.
