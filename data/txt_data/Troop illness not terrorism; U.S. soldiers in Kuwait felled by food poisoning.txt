Camp Doha, Kuwait --- The salmonella outbreak at a United States military installation near here this week that affected 271 service members was a result of poor food preparation, not terrorism, military officials said Friday.
Col. Michael C. Doherty, chief of preventive medicine for 3rd Medical Command described the outbreak as an "isolated incident that was quickly contained."

No service members at any of the six other large camps in Kuwait were affected by the food poisoning.
The incident occurred at Arifjan about 35 miles south of Kuwait City. It is one of the newer bases where American troops are housed while training for a possible war against Iraq. Camp Doha is just north of Kuwait City and has been a base since the Persian Gulf War.
About 15,000 American military personnel are based in the country.
The food poisoning incident resulted in 13 service members being sent to the Kuwait Armed Forces Hospital, where they stayed overnight. Another 258 received medical treatment at Arifjan, said Army Capt. Darryl Wright, a spokesman for American forces in Kuwait.
Those not hospitalized were given intravenous fluid and returned to duty in a few hours, Wright said.
The food was prepared by the U.S. company Brown and Root, according to Sgt. 1st Class David Dismukes. The company also provides cleaning and general labor at the camps.
Soldiers at base camps have access to three hot meals a day, while those training in the field usually get only one, if that, depending on their training schedules.
