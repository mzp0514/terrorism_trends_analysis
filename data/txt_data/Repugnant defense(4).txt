The State Department sent a host of wrong messages by including the anti-Israel, pro-Palestinian, pro-terrorist head of a U.S. Muslim group in a delegation to a recent 10-day human rights conference in Poland. 
Yet State defends sending Salam al-Marayati, the founder and president of the Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC), to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's annual Human Dimension Implementation Meetings. Incredibly, it called him "a valued and highly credible interlocutor on issues affecting Muslim countries." 
The Washington Free Beacon and The Investigative Project on Terrorism report examples of the "valued and highly credible" views of Mr. al-Marayati and his organization: 
 MPAC has urged removing Hamas and Hezbollah from the U.S. list of terrorist groups. 
 He once suggested Israel should be "on the suspect list" for the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. 
 He threatened to cut ties to the U.S. government in an angry 2011 Los Angeles Times op-ed about FBI use of "anti-Muslim" training materials. 
 On Russian TV this year, he portrayed Iran as the victim in the diplomatic crisis over its nuclear program and suggested Israel controls U.S. foreign policy. 
 He has criticized U.S. prosecutions of Islamist terrorists that resulted in convictions. 
The State Department should never have legitimized such repugnant views by choosing al-Marayati for this delegation -- and compounds that mistake by defending it.
