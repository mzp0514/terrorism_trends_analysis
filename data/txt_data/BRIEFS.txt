NATION U.S. Judge Postpones Trial Of Suspected Terrorists
A federal court judge in New York on Monday postponed until early January the trial of Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman and 11 other defendants because the blind Egyptian cleric remains hospitalized with pneumonia. The defendants are charged with plotting a war of urban terrorism.
Defense attorneys said they expected Abdel-Rahman, 56, who suffers from chronic diabetes and heart disease, to return to his detention cell by the end of the week, but that he would be too weak to stand trial. "I don't have any choice," Judge Michael B. Mukasey said, postponing jury selection until Jan. 9. LA Times REFUGEES U.S. Must Allow Haitian Children To Enter, Judge Says
Hundreds of Haitian children who have been living for months in U.S. tent camps in Cuba will be allowed to enter the United States, a federal judge in Miami ruled Tuesday.
Ruling on a motion filed by refugee advocates on behalf of 230 unaccompanied Haitian children at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, U.S. District Judge C. Clyde Atkins said the Haitian refugees should be granted the same parole as that given Cuban children.
"This is the right thing to do," said Steven Forester, consulting attorney for the Haitian Refugee Center in Miami, which filed the motion. "Before Thanksgiving the government should bring in the children, some of whose parents have been killed by the Haitian military," he said. Reuters
