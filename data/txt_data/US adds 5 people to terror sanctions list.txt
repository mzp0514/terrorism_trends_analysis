WASHINGTON (AP) - The Obama administration designated four Afghans and a Pakistani as terrorists on Thursday for their alleged support for al-Qaida, the Taliban or the Haqqani network. The action blocks any assets the men have in the United States.
The Treasury Department said the sanctions were aimed at financiers and facilitators of terrorism in Afghanistan and Pakistan. David S. Cohen, the undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said the actions continue U.S. efforts to "choke off streams of financial and other support to terrorists."
The individuals are Hajji Faizullah Khan Noorzai; Hajji Malik Noorzai; Abdur Rehman; Abdul Aziz Abbasin; and Fazal Rahim.
The Treasury Department described Faizullah as a prominent Taliban financier who has collected more than $100,000 from donors in the Arab Gulf region.
Malik, a Pakistan-based businessman, is accused of investing "millions of dollars" in various businesses for the Taliban. He has served for years as a caretaker of a madrassa on the Afghan-Pakistani border.
It said Rehman has served as a Taliban facilitator for the last three years and that his religious school in the Pakistani city of Karachi has directly supported the militant group.
It called Abbasin a key commander in the Haqqani network who reports to the top of the organization.
Rahim was arrested in 2010 by Pakistani authorities, the department said.
