First Secretary in India's Permanent Mission to the UN Vidisha Maitra said Pakistan "is globally recognized as the epicenter of terrorism"
New Delhi: In a scathing attack on Pakistan, First Secretary in India's Permanent Mission to the United Nations Vidisha Maitra termed neighboring Pakistan as a country "which is globally recognized as the epicenter of terrorism, which by its own admission harbors and trains terrorists, and hails them as martyrs." This came hours after Pakistan once again brought up the Kashmir issue at the United Nations.
Against the backdrop of the completion of 75 years of the United Nations, Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Monday brought up the issue of Jammu and Kashmir during his address to the high-level meeting on the commemoration of the 75th anniversary.
Terming Jammu and Kashmir and Palestine were the UN's "most glaring and long-standing disputes", Qureshi added that the people of Jammu and Kashmir still await the fulfillment of the commitment made to them by the United Nations to grant them their right to self-determination.
"We reject the malicious reference made to the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, which is an integral part of India. If there is an item that is unfinished on the agenda of the UN, it is that of tackling the scourge of terrorism," Maitra said, responding to Qureshi's remarks, adding, "India had hoped that during this solemn commemoration of a shared global milestone, the General Assembly would be spared another repetition of the baseless falsehoods."
Maitra termed the Pakistani Foreign Minister's comments on the Kashmir issue as "the never-ending fabricated narrative presented by the Pakistani representative about the internal affairs of India."
Turning down heavily on the neighbouring country, Maitra further added that "Pakistan will do well to turn its attention inwards to immediately addressing these pressing concerns instead of diverting attention from them by misusing the UN platforms."
