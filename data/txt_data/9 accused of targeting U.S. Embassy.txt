LONDON - Nine men suspected of plotting attacks on the U.S. Embassy and the London Stock Exchange were charged Monday with terrorism-related crimes and jailed until their next court appearance.
A dozen men were arrested last week in London, Cardiff and Stoke-on-Trent in central England in the largest British anti-terrorism raid in two years. Three were released without charge. The arrests came at a time of heightened anxiety about terrorist plots in Europe.
British officials have released few details, but U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the U.S. Embassy in London was among the alleged plot's potential targets.
We "are obviously taking suitable security precautions," Toner said in Washington.
U.K. officials have previously said that potential targets included the Houses of Parliament in London and shopping areas elsewhere in the U.K. Others on the potential target list included the London Stock Exchange as well as political and religious figures, the BBC reported, citing court proceedings.
A spokeswoman for Britain's Crown Prosecution Service said she could provide no comment or confirmation of what was said in court Monday, a national holiday in Britain.
The suspects are expected back in court Jan. 14 on a variety of terrorism-related charges.
