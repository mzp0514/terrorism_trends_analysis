Attorney General Janet Reno abruptly canceled a planned meeting yesterday with three militant antiabortion activists after announcing that the Justice Department's top anti-terrorism official will coordinate an investigation into escalating violence at abortion clinics.
After first setting up a meeting between Reno and antiabortion groups, department officials discovered late this week that three of those invited had outstanding arrest warrants or had been involved in unlawful activity, such as defiance of court orders, connected with clinic protests.
Officials of Planned Parenthood, which had scheduled their own meeting with Reno, said they were outraged that Reno would grant the activists access to her office and threatened to publicly criticize her.
But yesterday morning, department spokesman Carl Stern said a security check picked up problems in the backgrounds of the three activists, and they were informed that they were ''disinvited.'' The three were Donald Treshman of Rescue America, the Rev. Patrick Mahoney of Operation Rescue and Joseph Scheidler of the Pro-Life Action League.
''She's always said she would meet with responsible individuals,'' Stern said.
Reno announced in an earlier session with abortion rights supporters and women's groups that James S. Reynolds, chief of the terrorism and violent crime section, has been assigned as the department's ''point man'' to review evidence of clinic violence.
