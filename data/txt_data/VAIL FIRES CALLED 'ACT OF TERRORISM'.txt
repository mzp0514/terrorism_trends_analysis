Seven separate fires that destroyed a ski lodge and other buildings at 11,000 feet were an "act of terrorism," Gov. Roy Romer said yesterday as crews resumed work to expand the Vail Mountain resort.
"I know that mountain quite well, and it's inconceivable some natural occurrence would cause simultaneous fires on that ridge," Romer said at a news conference in Denver, 100 miles east of Vail.
The fires broke out early Monday and caused an estimated $12 million in damage, destroying the luxurious Two Elk restaurant, the Ski Patrol headquarters, a picnic spot, and four chairlifts.
The fires came after the resort began an 885-acre expansion project Friday that wildlife groups have said they believe will make the area uninhabitable for endangered lynx, and that cross-country skiers have said will limit access. The groups have denied any involvement.
State and federal agents were investigating the fires, which burned independent of each other. Two of the main buildings destroyed were more than a mile apart.
The expansion work resumed yesterday. Several workers used chain saws to clear trees, erected fencing, and began building a footbridge over a small creek.
Firefighters continued work on smoldering fires.
At least one other ski resort planned to step up security because of the fires.
