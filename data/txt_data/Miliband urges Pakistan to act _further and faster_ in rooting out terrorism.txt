(RTTNews) - On the second leg of his South Asian tour aimed at diffusing India-Pakistan tension over the Mumbai terrorist attacks, British Foreign Secretary David Miliband urged Pakistani government to act more quickly in prosecuting extremists involved in the incident.
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad after his meeting with Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani and foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Miliband said "The whole international community wants Pakistan to go further and faster" in rooting out terrorism.
"I want the Pakistan government to take action because British people have been hurt... because terrorism from Pakistan is a threat to the stability of the whole region," he told reporters.
The Pakistani government responded by saying it would conduct a transparent inquiry into the attacks on the Indian city in November, which killed more than 170 people.
Qureshi said that information provided by India, in addition to Pakistan&apos;s own investigations, would "establish legally tenable evidence to bring the perpetrators to justice."
The British Foreign Secretary arrived in the Pakistani capital Friday after visiting India.
He will also meet with President Asif Ali Zardari and army chief General Ashfaq Kayani.
