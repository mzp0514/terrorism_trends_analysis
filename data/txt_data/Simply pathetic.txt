Simply pathetic

Can Barack Obama become any more pathetic? Consider it a rhetorical question. 
Mr. Obama, in only the third Oval Office address of his presidency, offered the American people a limp-wristed regurgitation of his weak-kneed "strategy" to defeat ISIS and, of course, yet another call for more "gun control." 
The president, forced to concede that last week's massacre in San Bernardino, Calif., was "terrorism," quadrupled down on policies that, far from "containing" the terrorist group, appear to have, in their flaccidity, helped to export ISIS carnage. 
Then he effectively called for a ban on "assault weapons" because, after all, "the fact is that our intelligence and law enforcement agencies "” no matter how effective they are "” cannot identify every would-be mass shooter." 
And no Obama speech would be complete without the obligatory straw argument: the president called for banning sales of semi-automatic guns to those on the terrorism no-fly watch list, not even germane to the San Bernardino case and so many others. 
Once said Napoleon I: "Weak men are always timorous and suspicious." President Obama certainly is the former. But it should be the American people who are very suspicious of a commander in chief who possesses such a poor command of the real and growing threat facing this nation.
