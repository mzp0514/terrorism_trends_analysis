To the Editor:
On Oct. 23, Dr. Barnett Slepian was killed in his home by a sniper because he provided safe, legal abortions to women. This murder was the latest in the wave of attacks against abortion providers and patients throughout the country.
#KOSMITH.NOV#
Five sniper attacks against abortion providers have occurred in the United States and Canada in the last four years. An off-duty police officer died and two people were injured in a clinic bombing in Birmingham this past January. A year before that, two bombings in Atlanta injured doctors, patients and rescue workers. Two women lost their lives to a gunman at a Boston clinic in 1996 and another abortion provider was murdered in Pensacola, Fla., in 1994.
These terroristic acts aim to intimidate political opponents into silence and withdrawal. The intent is to suppress speech, curtail constitutional rights and instill paralyzing fear in those whose beliefs the terrorists oppose. Sounds familiar, doesn't it, Lancaster County? Take action - call or send a note to Attorney General Reno to move swiftly in solving this terrorist attack issue and to provide protection for those vulnerable to attack in the future.
