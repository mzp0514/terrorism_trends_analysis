Bhutto Government Combats Terrorism
Regarding the article "Pakistan's Plea for Trade, Not Aid, Hangs on Its Ability to Curb Violence," May 24: The allegation that "the government is backing terrorism and is supporting the MQM Haqiqi Group with the purpose of undercutting MQM Altaf Group's clout" is totally baseless. The government is in no way involved with either of the two factions of the MQM.
To the contrary, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People Party commands a majority in the Sindh Assembly, and as such has no need to play off one MQM faction against the other.

Put families first
The editorial "Families in Need," May 31, utterly baffled me. It would seem logical to expect the Monitor to deplore the findings of the Population Council's report about the worldwide rise in divorce, unwed motherhood, and single parent families.
Instead, the Monitor is ready to prophesy that all these disturbing trends are only byproducts of something greater, i.e. "a revolution in the role of women as contributors outside the family." Is there anything that is worth preserving from sacrifice on the altar of Women and Career?
