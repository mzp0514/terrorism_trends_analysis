To the Editor: 
  ''A Terror Threat in the Courts,'' by John Farmer (Op-Ed, Jan. 13), advocates for legislation allowing so-called preventive detention, in which terrorism suspects can be taken into custody because they are believed to be harboring certain thoughts or ideas that the government considers dangerous.
Mr. Farmer claims that this is necessary because the civilian criminal court system is not equipped to prosecute terrorists for acts that they may not have committed yet. 
  Despite Mr. Farmer's claim that preventive detention is necessary to prohibit the government from criminalizing thoughts and to protect civil liberties, this unprecedented and unconstitutional policy would have the same effect Mr. Farmer warns of in criminal prosecutions of terror suspects -- punishing people simply for their thoughts. 
  While Mr. Farmer rightly argues that since 9/11 our criminal laws have been extended to encompass conduct never before considered criminal, his proposed solution would do more harm to due process than the problems he purports to be addressing. 
  Our constitutional due process rights -- the cornerstone of our criminal justice system -- protect us against exactly the type of imprisonment Mr. Farmer is proposing. By doing away with core due process protections, we would risk bringing down the entire foundation on which this country, and our system of justice, was created. 
  Our courts have proved that they are more than able to handle terrorism-related cases, and that is exactly where these cases should be tried.
