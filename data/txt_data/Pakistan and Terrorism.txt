To the Editor:
  Re ''A Dangerous Place'' (editorial, June 13), about the situation on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border:
  You state that the Pakistani leadership has ''failed to tell their people the truth: that the fight against extremists is essential for their own country's stability and security.'' One must take exception to that on two counts: 
  First, the leadership of the present government at least has unequivocally and repeatedly stated that the fight against terrorism is a fight for Pakistan's future. Yousaf Raza Gilani, the prime minister of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari, the chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party, and Husain Haqqani, the ambassador of Pakistan to the United States, are on record as having said this on more than one occasion.
  Second, the people of Pakistan fully understand the stakes involved. These are nothing less than the future of Pakistan as a peaceful, prosperous and progressive Muslim state. 
  Pakistan and the United States are partners in the fight against terrorism. The solution to the difficulties we encounter in the federally administered tribal areas is to adopt a broad-based approach consisting of negotiations to wean hostile neutrals away from extremism, providing the people of the federally administered tribal areas with opportunities to better their lives and use of force wherever and whenever needed against those irreconcilably wedded to violence.
