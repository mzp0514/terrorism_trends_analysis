One key point to take away from recent presidential debates and statements is how convoluted Mr. Romney's vision for our military really is. The U.S. already spends more than the next 10 countries combined on defense. To Mr. Romney, this is "underfunded," so he intends to spend $2 trillion more, mostly to build more ships and increase troop numbers. 
In an era where aircraft-fired AMRAAM missiles lock onto targets 30-plus miles out and Tomahawk missiles up to 1,500 miles out - well beyond visual range - numbers account for little against superior technology. Under Obama, more research has gone into making the U.S. a smarter combatant, and not necessarily a larger one. Vastly increased drone development and utilization is one way the U.S. military will become more lean and mean. Why endanger U.S. airmen when a drone can fire that same missile at 30-plus miles? Obama has also greatly expanded our cyber-terrorism capabilities. With nuclear reactors in Iran being shut down due to cyber attacks, this is an avenue of attack the U.S. can ill afford to ignore. Our country has developed greatly from the imperialistic, boots-on-the-ground mentality of the last century. Some $2 trillion in military spending does little when you spend it on ships and occupation in this era. As the U.S. military becomes more of a global police force, we must evolve from a hammer to a scalpel, and Obama understands this fully.
