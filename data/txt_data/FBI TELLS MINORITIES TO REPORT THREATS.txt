Hate mail or harassing phone calls can be an important early signal of violence to come, an FBI anti-terrorism expert warned representatives of more than a dozen minority and civic organizations Tuesday night.
Such behavior is typical of a disgruntled member of a hate group, who grows impatient and takes the cause into his own hands, said Special Agent Bill Francis, who leads the FBI's anti-terrorism squad at St. Louis.
"They go off on their own, and they start doing the kinds of things they've done," he said, making particular reference to the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City.
Although nasty comments alone may not be enough to spur an investigation, Francis said, he urged individuals who are targets of such remarks to turn over what they get and let the FBI decide.
Francis and others from law enforcement and private security shared advice during a seminar at the Post-Dispatch, co-sponsored by the American Jewish Committee and the Japanese American Citizens League.
Whether by domestic or international terrorists, Francis said, use of some weapon of mass destruction against the U.S. - nuclear, biological or chemical - is considered "an absolute certainty." Cities are likely targets, he said, but a device might be tested in a rural area first.
