No group immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing.
Bomb explosion destroys offices of Citibank in El SalvadorBanks and businesses have been popular targets for left-wing groups fighting to topple the civilian-military junta.
No injuries were reported in the blast, which occurred at 7:30 P.M., but flying glass in the hotel narrowly missed several people, most of them reporters. The Associated Press office is in the hotel.
The attack on the Citibank offices in the 18-story Roble Towers was the third in two years. Bombings have become more frequent in recent weeks, suggesting that the left is renewing its terrorism in the capital after a relatively quiet month.
Earlier yesterday, a leftist source said Government troops had used napalm in attacks on guerrilla strongholds. The military denied the charge, which was initially broadcast by the guerrilla radio station, Radio Venceremos.
Meanwhile, authorities reported finding the bodies of 30 more gunshot victims in various parts of the country, but did not say whether they were battle casualties or targets of right or left terrorism.
