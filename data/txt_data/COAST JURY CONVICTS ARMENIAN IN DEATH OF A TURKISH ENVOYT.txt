An Armenian immigrant was convicted today of the first-degree murder of a Turkish diplomat who was ambushed in his car at a busy intersection two years ago.
The jury also found that that Consul General Kemal Arikan was killed because of his nationality, which means the defendant, Hampig Sassounian, a 20-year-old resident of Pasadena, could face the death penalty.

The eight-woman, four-man jury began deliberations Nov. 28, but Judge Henry Nelson of Superior Court twice interrupted their discussions so the defense could call prison inmates to dispute testimony by other inmates who testified that Mr. Sassounian had admitted the crime in jailhouse conversations.
Mr. Arikan, 54, was ambushed at a Wilshire Boulevard intersection in the Westwood district in January 1982 while driving from his home to the Turkish consulate in Beverly Hills. He was shot 14 times by an automatic weapon fired at close range. A group called Justice Commandos for the Armenian Genocide took responsibility.
Lael Rubin, the prosecutor, referred several times in the trial to the killing of countless Armenians by Turks early in this century. He insisted, ''The defendant's action was clearly an act of terrorism.''
Mr. Sassounian said he was innocent, but prosecutors presented witnesses placing him at the scene.
A second suspect in the shooting, Krikor Saliba, remains a fugitive.
