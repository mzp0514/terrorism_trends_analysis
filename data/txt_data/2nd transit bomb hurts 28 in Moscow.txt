Russian troops guarded subways, trolleys and bus stations against a feared wave of terrorism Friday after a bus bomb shattered Moscow's morning rush hour for the second straight day.
Eight of the 28 people injured were in serious condition.
An Associated Press report
Moscow's riot police commander promised to station armed troops in every bus, trolley and metro car, and police checkpoints outside Moscow were tightened.
President Boris Yeltsin promised tough new measures in a city he said is "polluted with terrorists."
Speaking to a meeting of the Federal Security Service, Yeltsin said fighting terrorism "must become your priority. Moscow has not been cleansed. The situation has become dangerous."
No group has claimed responsibility for this week's bombings. But suspicion fell on Chechen separatist rebels, who have long threatened terrorist attacks in major Russian cities. The rebels swiftly denied involvement.
Some officials suggested gangsters might be protesting an anti-crime decree Yeltsin signed this week. The decree puts the fight against terrorism directly under his control.
The bomb was stronger than one that blew up on a trolley in central Moscow 24 hours earlier, injuring five people. Both bombs were hidden in cloth bags under seats near the middle door, police said.
Friday's bomb was the third on Moscow's public transportation system since June 11, when a subway blast killed four people.
