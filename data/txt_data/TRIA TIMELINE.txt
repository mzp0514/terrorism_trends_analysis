Key dates in the formation and expiration of the federal government's terrorism insurance backstop program
Nov. 26, 2002 - President George W. Bush signs the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 into law, creating the federal terrorism insurance backstop in response to the terrorist attacks on New York, Washington and Pennsylvania on Sept. 11, 2001. The program is slated to expire on Dec. 31, 2005.
December 2005 - Congress approves legislation to extend the terrorism insurance program until Dec. 31, 2007, which President Bush signs into law.
December 2007 - The terrorism insurance backstop is reauthorized through Dec. 31, 2014. While rejecting attempts to add life insurance to the lines of insurance covered by the program, lawmakers agree to extend the program to cover acts of domestic as well as foreign terrorism.
Dec. 10, 2014 - The House of Representatives approves legislation that would extend the terrorism insurance program through Dec. 31, 2020, while increasing the minimum trigger to activate the program to $200 million of insured damage and gradually increasing the industrywide deductible to $37.5 billion. The bill also contains a provision that would create a National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers to streamline interstate producer licensing.
Dec. 16, 2014 - The Senate fails to take up the measure before adjourning because of one senator's objection to the NARAB provision.
Dec. 17, 2014 - House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, criticizes the Senate's failure to approve the bill and says in his blog "we expect the House will act very quickly in the new Congress to reauthorize this program."
Dec. 31, 2014 - The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act will expire because of the Senate's failure to extend the program.
