A man who set off terror alarms re-entering the country at O'Hare International Airport Thursday turned out to be wanted on a Minnesota assault warrant for making "terroristic threats" â€” but not in the sense usually associated with terrorism.
"It has nothing to do with terrorism or Homeland Security issues," said Kristi Chrissis of the Wright County attorney's office in Minnesota.
Ismail Alqawasmi, 36, of Richfield, Minn., was trying to clear U.S. Customs on a return from Jordan when a name check revealed a Minnesota warrant for "terroristic threats."
Alqawasmi was arrested and his Jordanian passport confiscated.
Yet "terroristic threats" in Minnesota law means to "threaten directly or indirectly to commit any crime of violence with purpose to terrorize another."
Alqawasmi was charged in a January 2008 incident in which authorities
allege he threatened a St. Michael, Minn., man with a knife outside the man's house. He was also charged with assault.
The case is still pending. The terroristic-threats charge carries a maximum sentence of five years and a $10,000 fine, the assault charge a 90-day sentence and $1,000 fine.
Alqawasmi made a court appearance in Chicago Friday, where no new charges were filed and he was freed.
