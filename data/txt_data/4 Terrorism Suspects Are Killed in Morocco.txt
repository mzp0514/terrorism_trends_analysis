Three men suspected in the bombing of an Internet cafe blew themselves up on Tuesday as the police closed in. A fourth man was fatally shot as he tried to detonate a bomb, the authorities said.
  A police officer was killed and a 7-year-old boy suffered minor injuries in one of the explosions. The blasts over several hours in Casablanca, weeks after the bombing of the Internet cafe in the city, promised to further rattle Morocco, whose first high-profile brush with Islamic terrorism came in five suicide bombings in the city in May 2003.
The authorities responded to those attacks, which left 45 people dead, with the arrest of thousands of reputed Islamic militants -- some accused of conspiring with Al Qaeda to plan strikes in Morocco and abroad. At least two of those killed Tuesday were said to be linked to those attacks. The men who died Tuesday were also accused of being involved in the March 11 bombing of the Internet cafe -- which killed the bomber and four others.
  The violence on Tuesday started when the police, acting on a tip, surrounded a four-story apartment building in the working-class Hay Farah district.
  One man blew himself up on the roof, another did so hours later as the police were searching for him and the third detonated his explosives in the middle of a boulevard. That blast also killed the police officer. 
  The police said the investigations into the cafe bombing led them to a wider plot to attack the port in Casablanca, as well as police stations and tourist sites in Morocco.
