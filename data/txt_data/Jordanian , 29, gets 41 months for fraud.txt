A man accused of leading a fraud and money-laundering ring was sentenced Tuesday to 41 months in prison.
U.S. District Judge Dale A. Kimball gave Alaa Ramadan, a 29-year old Jordanian who lived in Salt Lake City, the maximum sentence for federal violations involving mortgage, loan, credit card and other money laundering schemes. Ramadan pleaded guilty to the offenses in October.
After completing the sentence, Ramadan will be deported, most likely to Jordan, said his attorney, Loni DeLand.
Ramadan also pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of failing to file federal income tax returns. He will be asked to pay about $50,000 in back taxes and almost $1 million in restitution, DeLand said.
Ramadan was indicted in October 2005 along with Bassam Omar for allegedly attempting to defraud two Utah banks of $120,000, among other allegations. The case against Omar is pending.
The FBI's Joint Terrorism Taskforce investigated but determined none of the charges involved terrorism, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Salt Lake City. Prosecutors initially said the money-laundering ring involved at least six relatives of a former Utahn suspected of aiding terrorism in Iraq. Shawqi Omar was being held in a U.S. prison in Iraq for his alleged ties to al-Qaida.
James M. Gibbons, 48, of Sandy, is scheduled to be sentenced Thursday in the case related to the fraud ring.
