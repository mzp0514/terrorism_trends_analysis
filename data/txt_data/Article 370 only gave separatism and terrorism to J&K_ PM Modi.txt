GUWAHATI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday, defending his move on scrapping the article 370 said, the special provision was the reason behind separatism and terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.

Speaking on the occasion of 144th birth anniversary of the Iron Man of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, PM Modi said, "Article 370 only gave separatism and terrorism to J&K.;"

He also added that, nearly 40,000 people in three decades have been killed by terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir.

Attacking Pakistan, the Prime Minister said that those who cannot win wars against our country, are trying to destroy India's unity.

Paying tribute to the Statue of Unity on Thursday, PM Modi said, "Centuries ago, India was united by Chanakya, and after that Sardar Patel achieved the same feat by merging princely states with the Union of India."

It is to be mentioned that, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Kevadiya, Gujarat to pay tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on his 144th birth anniversary at the Statue of Unity.

PM Modi was received at the Ahmedabad airport by Governor Acharya Devvrat, Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and other dignitaries, on Wednesday.

After that, he went to visit his mother Hiraba in Raysan village near Gandhinagar.

Since 2014, the Modi government has been celebrating Patel's birth anniversary as 'Ekta Diwas' or National Unity Day.

Patel was born on October 31, 1875, at Nadiad, Gujrat. He was the country's first Home Minister and is credited for merging over 560 states into the Union of India.
