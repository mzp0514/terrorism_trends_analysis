It is good to see President Bush publicly declare what we all suspect and fear -- that Osama bin Laden is trying to get nuclear bombs ("Bush warns of growing threat," News, Wednesday).
There can be no doubt that when bin Laden and the Taliban get their hands on such weapons, they will be used.
I beseech every individual around the world to support the U.S.-led war on terrorist governments and to support an even more aggressive anti-terrorism campaign.
It's a very real possibility that we could wake up one day and find New York, London or Sydney completely gone.
Let's not be fooled by the pacifist bromide that says we should not be at war because violence begets violence. It is time to realize that nothing these terrorist governments get from us will satisfy them -- even if it is all of the land, money or obedience in the world.
All of the terrorist demands, in my view, are a coverup for a much deeper motive. Deep down, since they have no self-esteem, their only goal is to destroy all of those who have it.
As Ayn Rand wrote in her classic, Atlas Shrugged:  "They do not want to live. They want you to die."
As I see the current situation, even killing life-loving people will not please the terrorists, since self-esteem cannot be achieved this way. That is why, unable to face their own self-hatred and endless self-defeat, they take their own lives in the act of taking others'.
