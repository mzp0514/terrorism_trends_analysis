A judge today formally dismissed terrorism charges that had been filed against four teens accused in a guns-and-terror plot at Winslow High School.
The quartet - who never purchased weapons or harmed anyone - still face charges of attempted murder and terroristic threats.
The state terrorism charge is relatively new and no one has been tried on it yet in the state.
State Superior Court Judge Angelo DiCamillo also set July 11 for a hearing on the Camden County Prosecutor's request to try two of the four youths - the 15-year-old alleged ringleader and a 16-year-old - as adults.
The four boys, whose names are being withheld by authorites because they are juveniles, allegedly hatched the plot months ago. They are accused of planning to launch the attack last month in a fourth-period lunchroom, and shoot a "hit list" of students, teachers and others.
Jeffrey Hark, attorney for the only youth who has been allowed to leave juvenile detention center, argued this morning for looser regulations for his client's house arrest.
DiCamillo denied the request.
"My client was very upset about that, very disappointed," Hark said. "He'd like to be outside with his other friends, other 15- and 16-year-olds."
Hark has filed a motion to have all charges against his client dismissed. The attorney has said the boy had one conversation in which he jokingly said he would participate in the plot, but then in a later conversation, he said he would not.
"It's my client's position that there was no conspiracy to do anything," said Hark.
