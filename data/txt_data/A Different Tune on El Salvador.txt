Bit by bit, the Reagan Administration is retreating in its El Salvador policy to a position strikingly similar - dare we say it? - to that of the Carter Administration. For weeks, Secretary of State Haig could see only one cause for violence in the tiny Central American republic: left-wing, Soviet-abetted terrorism.
Editorial discusses Reagan Administration policy towards El Salvador and implies they are 'retreating' to Carter Administration policyHe even implied that El Salvador's security forces were not primarily to blame in the death of three American nuns and a lay missionary last December.
The tune is changing. After more than 20 civilians were murdered Tuesday in the suburbs of San Salvador with the obvious involvement of the security forces, a State Department spokesman demanded an end of acts of violence ''by all parties.'' And for the first time in this Administration, a particular atrocity by right-wing death squads was noted and deplored.
However welcome this even-handedness, it should have policy implications. Both the Carter and Reagan Administrations have armed a ruling junta that has been unwilling or unable to control the murderous security forces. Those forces remain unpunished for the murder of the American nuns and unrestrained from committing similar brutalities.
So long as military aid is so eagerly proffered by the United States, the death squads can continue to slaughter with impunity.  Nominally, the weapons are said be going to the support of President Jose Napoleon Duarte. But Mr. Duarte insists that he most needs economic, not military, aid. When that message is finally heard, the Reagan team may begin to build a policy that is distinctly and more promisingly its own.
