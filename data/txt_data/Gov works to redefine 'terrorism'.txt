ALBANY - Gov. Cuomo wants to redefine domestic terrorism, but he hasn't figured out how to do it yet.
The governor on Wednesday called domestic terrorism "hate-inspired, mass murder by an American" - and he wants to combat hate crimes and white supremacist groups.
"We are in a transition again where we have these new problems, new complexities that crop up that we have to adjust to," Cuomo told Long Island News radio.
The in-the-works measure was directly inspired by recent mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, and will be aimed at the spread of information online, the governor said. The shooter in the Texas massacre said he was targeting Mexican immigrants.
"These white supremacist groups, these white nationalist groups, this hate that breeds on the internet, and then you put that together with an assault weapon and you have 22 dead in a couple of minutes," Cuomo said. "I'm going to do a proposal for a law in the state of New York that basically redefines domestic terrorism."
The governor and other critics have repeatedly tied the recent rise in white nationalists and hate groups to President Trump's racist rhetoric.
Last year, 49 people were murdered by far right extremists, more than any year since the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, according to the Anti-Defamation League.
From 2009 through 2018, the far right has been responsible for 73% of domestic extremist-related fatalities, according to the group.
The FBI defines domestic terrorism as actions taken by people "inspired by or associated primarily with U.S.-based movements that espouse extremist ideologies of a political, religious, social, racial or environmental nature."
