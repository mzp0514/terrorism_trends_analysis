Russia is to reintroduce trial by jury in several regions next week, 76 years after the Bolsheviks abolished the system as corrupt and bourgeois, the Justice Ministry said today.
"For the first time in 76 years, the street court or people's court is returning to Russia -- a form of law which allows lawbreaking to be not only dealt with by social morality but also by the formal juridical demands of the law," the ministry said in a statement.
Jury trials, which will be held in five regions starting in November, will be used for a number of serious crimes, including treason, terrorism and incitement to treason. The statement did not name the five pilot regions. Defendants will be offered the choice of trial under the existing court system or by a jury of 12 freely selected citizens.
Jury trials will be extended from next January to four more regions, and later, once any initial problems have been ironed out, will be offered all over Russia, the statement said.
Trial by jury was introduced in 1864, in czarist Russia. But Bolshevik leaders abolished juries in 1917 and replaced them with one judge and two assistants for each case.
Although the influence of the authorities has declined since the collapse of Communism, the judiciary remains vulnerable to political pressure.
