Terrorism can happen any time, any place.
 And it can affect anyone, of any race, creed or religion, said speaker Hesham Nasser Reda during a forum Tuesday night at the University of Minnesota.
"It does not matter," said Reda, the director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council in Washington, D.C. "It can be me, you or hundreds of innocent people. We can all be faced with grave circumstances."
 He and Raymond Tanter, a political science professor at the University of Michigan, shared their views with about 50 people during the 90-minute discussion, "Responding to the Challenge of Terrorism."
 Tanter said that while terrorists often perpetuate violence for political and societal reasons, many factions also react because of religious beliefs.
 He said nations usually deal with terrorism in one of two ways: by threat or denial.
 "Some countries respond to terrorist threats by retaliating after an attack," Tanter said. "Others act like it never happened. There is a battle out there."
 Reda also said the belief that Muslims and Arabs are behind most terrorist attacks is a stereotype. He said recent movies such as "The Siege" only perpetuate that notion, which needs to stop.
 "I can honestly say that 99.9 percent of all Muslims are very peaceful and kind," Reda said. "The religion calls for nonviolence."
 When an audience member asked what could be done to minimize terrorism, Reda said countries should "promote the values of good, give them hope and give them a future to look forward to."
 Tanter shared similar views.
 "I think we must prepare for the possible event of terrorism, but we also must continue to practice civility as well."
