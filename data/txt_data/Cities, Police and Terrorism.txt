To the Editor:
  You captured the difficulties of modern policing in your July 24 news article about the Providence, R.I., police. 
  The chief, Col. Dean M. Esserman, and his peers around the country face tremendous challenges as they balance public safety with homeland security. Loosely affiliated transnational networks are now likely to be as much a threat as nation states are. These networks can avoid traditional defenses and manifest themselves in cities like Providence. 
  Nonstate actors, including Al Qaeda, the Japanese cult group Aum Shinrikyo and Mexican drug cartels, have also used highly destructive weapons. In addition, there are increasingly sophisticated criminal enterprises and violent gangs. 
  In today's globalized world, local police departments must reorganize so they can meet all public safety challenges. High-tech intelligence fusion centers, for example, cannot be constrained to terrorism alone. These resources must also be deployed against traditional threats like criminal gangs. Similarly, federal programs financing local police initiatives must permit flexibility and reallocation of resources as threats change.  Tim Connors
