I would like to remind President Barack Obama that the United States does not negotiate with terrorists. Under no circumstances can this rule be broken, even when it is our own government engaging in terroristic activities.
The Republicans are once again using political terrorism to scare the president to caving at their every whim. When the Republicans threatened to withhold benefits to the poor, middle class and the elderly if the Bush tax cuts weren't extended for the rich, the president caved to their demands. This time, the terrorist Republican Party is threatening the entire global economy. If the president doesn't do what they want, they are perfectly fine with allowing the entire nation and the world to collapse. Any reasonable person can see that not only do we need to tackle the budget crisis with spending cuts, but the nation also needs to increase revenue.
If you owned a struggling business, you wouldn't just be satisfied with cutting spending, would you? You would also want to increase your profits. Just ask the Port Authority, which seems to think that by cutting routes, you somehow gain revenue.
Please, Mr. President, just remember the policy: Do not negotiate with terrorists! Especially the political ones.
