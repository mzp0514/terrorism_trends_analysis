(RTTNews) - A Canadian court on Thursday sentenced Momin Khawaja, a former software developer convicted of involvement in a foiled bomb plot in Britain, to 10 years and six months in prison for financing and facilitating terrorism.
He was convicted last October on five terrorism-related offenses and two criminal charges for working on a remote-control device to set off explosions and for possessing an explosive substance.
Khawaja was arrested in Canada in March 2004 in a joint UK-Canadian operation and was accused of planning terror attacks in Britain. He has already spent nearly five years in prison since his arrest.
Prosecutors had argued that Khawaja had collaborated with five others in a foiled 2004 plan to attack a London nightclub, a shopping center and electrical and gas facilities. His five co-conspirators were sentenced to life in prison in April 2007 for their involvement in the bomb plot.
Khawaja is the first person to be sentenced under Canada&apos;s Anti-Terrorism Act, which was enacted in 2001 after the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States. He pleaded not guilty to the charges and was tried without a jury.
