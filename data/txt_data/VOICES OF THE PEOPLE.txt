Dem House member's comments out of line
Recently, Minnesota's freshman Democrat, Ilhan Omar, a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, told PBS that "policies that we have put in place has kind of helped lead the devastation in Venezuela and we have sort of set the stage for where we are arriving today."
In other words, it's America's fault that the nation of Venezuela is in serious trouble. Mass starvation in that once prosperous country is very near. Most people realize that the disaster in Venezuela was caused by the actions of Hugo Chavez and his successor, Nicolas Maduro, both of whom are socialist tyrants whose policies destroyed their country.
Omar has repeatedly spewed anti-Semitic statements that in normal times would have warranted a sharp rebuke from her party. Instead, the Democrats could only muster a watered-down resolution that rejected anti-Semitism, but failed to even mention her by name, which will no doubt lead to more of the same from Omar. Anti-Semitic rhetoric appears to be the Democrats' new normal.
Another bigoted offense that Omar has committed in her short congressional career is her casual dismissal of the 9/11 terrorist attack as "some people did something." Every American knows what "some people" did and who did it. Al-Qaida killed 3,000 Americans in the most heinous act of this century.
Perhaps the most egregious of all is her participation in clandestine fundraisers with groups that have been tied to the support of terrorism, such as Islamic Relief, a charity organization long said to have deep ties to Hamas and other groups that advocate terrorism against Israel. One must wonder whose side is Ilhan Omar on: America's or Al-Qaida's.
