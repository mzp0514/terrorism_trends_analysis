Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik called on Israel yesterday to show the world "you can't be intimidated by terrorism."
Kerik's appeal for continued toughness came as tourism to Israel idled at a fraction of its normal level - severely denting the Israeli economy - after 11 months of Palestinian-Israeli violence.
The U.S. State Department warned U.S. citizens this month to defer travel to Israel, the West Bank and Gaza in the face of a "heightened threat of terrorist incidents" in those locations.
Kerik was in Jerusalem yesterday to discuss common concerns, including terrorism and narcotics trafficking, with Israeli Police Commissioner Shlomo Aharonishki. "I thought that if I'm going to come, this is the time to come and send a clear message - you can't be intimidated by terrorism," he said after the meeting. "People shouldn't be afraid to come to Israel."
Kerik also assured Israeli leaders that the NYPD will remain on alert for attacks on Jewish institutions in New York as long as Israeli-Palestinian fighting continues.
The department is working with the FBI and the New York State Police on an anti-terrorism task force and is on top of all potential threats, Kerik said.
"We've been on what we call 'enhanced alert' for the past several months, since the violence broke out here several months ago, and we've been doing just fine," he said. "That alert status will remain as is until further notice."
