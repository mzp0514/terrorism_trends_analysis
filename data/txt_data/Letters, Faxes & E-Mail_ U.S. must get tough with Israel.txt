In response to "Ex-nominee has dismal record on terrorism" (Letters, Aug.  2): When Ehud Barak was sworn in as Israel's new prime minister, he brought a gleam of hope to the stalled peace process. He vowed to immediately implement the troop withdrawals specified in the Wye River Accords.ConstitutionThere would be no more home demolitions, a practice that has left thousands of Palestinian families homeless.
Barak's commitments for peace brought immediate action from the White House: President Clinton awarded Israel with an additional $ 500 million in annual military aid, 50 F-15 fighter jets and $ 1.2 billion for highway construction.
A month has passed since Barak took office, and the troop withdrawals have been delayed until October. Now, we read in the newspaper that "Israeli soldiers clashed with about 200 Palestinians protesting the demolition of three Palestinian homes in the West Bank" ("Violence shadows Mideast talks," Aug. 12). Instead of the United States condemning Israel for its brutality, which instigates terrorism, it rewards Israel with additional aid. The U.S. Middle East policy is so unbalanced that it actually encourages more unrest. Until our government overcomes its political correctness and gets tough with Israel, there never will be peace in the Middle East.
