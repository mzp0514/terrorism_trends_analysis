MIAMI - Production of thousands of classified documents sought by the attorney for convicted terrorism plotter Jose Padilla is holding up his resentencing in the case, a federal judge was told Wednesday.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Frazier told U.S. District Judge Marcia Cooke it will take two months to disclose about 4,700 Defense Department documents that Padilla's attorney wants.
The exact nature of those documents is unknown, but Padilla was held for more than three years without charge as an enemy combatant at a Navy brig before he was indicted in Miami. Padilla's attorneys have said he was mistreated and subjected to psychological duress at the brig, something the Pentagon has long denied.
Cooke said she will set a firm resentencing date at an April hearing "and bring this matter to a conclusion."
Padilla, 43, was originally sentenced in 2008 to a little more than 17 years in prison for terrorism support and conspiracy convictions.
The case is back before Cooke because the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2011 that the sentence was too lenient, given Padilla's lengthy criminal record as a Chicago gang member and terrorist training at an al-Qaida camp in Afghanistan.
Padilla, a U.S. citizen who became a Muslim convert in prison, was arrested by the FBI in 2002 at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport in what authorities at the time said was an al-Qaida plot to detonate a radioactive "dirty bomb" in a U.S. city.
