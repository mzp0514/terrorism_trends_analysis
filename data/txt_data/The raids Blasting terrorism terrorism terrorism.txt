NATURALLY, some Americans will suspect that President Clinton ordered
Thursday's military raids on Islamic terrorists to divert attention
from his sex inquisition.
During the press briefing with Defense Secretary William Cohen, a
reporter pointed out that the situation resembles the movie "Wag the
Dog," in which a president starts a war to draw the spotlight away
from sex charges against him.  him.  him.
Cohen replied the only purpose of the strikes was to destroy terrorist
camps and weapons of Osama bin Laden, presumed mastermind of the
double bombing of U.S. embassies in East Africa.
Bin Laden, operating from a base in Afghanistan, is a millionaire
Saudi fanatic who arms and finances Muslim attack groups in several
nations. He publishes newspaper ads declaring that a "fatwa"
(religious edict) requires all good Muslims to "kill Americans."
President Clinton said Washington received evidence that more attacks
were imminent. Cohen said the camps in Sudan were making ingredients
for nerve gas. He said the goal of Thursday's raids was to cripple bin
Laden's capacity to inflict more death on Americans.
Well, we certainly hope that was the sole motive for the U.S. strikes.
And we hope they don't kindle more Islamic terrorism against America.
Such retaliation isn't new. President Reagan ordered an air strike on
Libya in response to a bombing. President Bush organized the Gulf War
against Iraq. Conflict with rogue Islamic factions and states is the
chief danger of current times.  times.  times.
