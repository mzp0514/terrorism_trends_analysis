On Sunday, the FBI's Joint Terrorism Force thwarted an attack planned for July 4 in Cleveland. A local man, Demetrius Pitts, 48, had planned to set off bombs during the city's annual fireworks display. He told an undercover agent that he wanted to kill American citizens and was "willing to chop off hands and heads." He was arrested and is being charged with attempting to provide material support to al-Qaida.
 Last month, the undercover agent gave Pitts a cellphone that was supposedly from al-Qaida supporters. Pitts took pictures of potential spots to park a van full of explosives - and videos of possible targets. He returned the phone to the agent, believing the images would be used to plan an attack.
 Pitts first appeared on the FBI's radar in 2017 after making Facebook posts threatening violence against the U.S. He began meeting with an undercover agent and discussed several different ways to carry out an attack. He also talked about his hatred for the military and expressed support for al-Qaida.
 Despite the recent black eye given to the FBI's reputation by its leadership, we are eternally thankful for the agency's thousands of field agents who continue to do their jobs incredibly well. Because of the diligence and dedication these honorable men and women put into their work, hundreds of planned attacks have been prevented and most Americans are able to go about their lives free from the fear of terror threats.
