Washington --- U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, an Athens Republican, has introduced legislation to restrict foreign delegations from countries listed as sponsors of terrorism to a half-mile radius when they visit the United Nations in New York City.
Broun said this week that he was "highly incensed" after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made a request to visit the ruins of the World Trade Center during a trip to address the U.N.
The Georgia lawmaker said the State Department regularly issues diplomatic visas to U.N. representatives whose countries are on the U.S. list of states that sponsor terrorism. Some visas limit traveling to a 25-mile radius within the United States, but others have no limits, he said.
That opens the door to spying, he said, citing two employees of Iran's U.N. mission who were sent home in 2004 for taking videos and photographs of subways and other sensitive spots in New York.
Broun said his office researched food, residential and hospital facilities and concluded visitors "could get everything that they need for their health and well-being" within a half-mile of the U.N. headquarters.
His Limiting the Intrusive Miles of International Terrorist Sponsors Act has 14 co-sponsors.
