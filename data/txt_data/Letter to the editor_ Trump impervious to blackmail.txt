Trump impervious to blackmail

Allow me one critical comment on Michael Corrigan's recent entertaining column, "Political Crap."
      
Clearly, Mr. Trump suffers from URS (Undisciplined Rhetoric Syndrome) as his recently Russia gaffe painfully reminds us. But the URS bug is going around these days - even Mr. Corrigan seems to have picked up a light case.
      
By opining that President Trump "possibly fears some cards the Russians are holding," Mr. Corrigan clearly implies blackmail by neo-Kremlin forces. Seriously? The very notion takes URS to a new level. Why? Surely by now, it's apparent that Mr. Trump is impervious to blackmail - simply because everyone (supporters included) have absorbed so much negative information that more of the same offers little to fear.
      
And there are more serious issues afoot. The Russia pivot by this administration is a return to the real politic of Secretary Kissinger - a recovery from excessive moralism on the world stage. Note that the Saudi regime has been successfully recruited by the administration to fight terrorism and oppose the Iran regime. Note that the greater geopolitical threat to the USA is not Russia, but China. Note that we have but one president at a time.
