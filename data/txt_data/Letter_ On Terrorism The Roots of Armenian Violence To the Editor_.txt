No matter how strongly one may disagree with their methods (and our organization has condemned indiscriminate violence like that perpetrated by the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia in July at Orly Airport), it serves no purpose to misrepresent the motives of Armenian terrorist organizations and to ignore the facts by suggesting, as your Aug. 9 editorial does, that they are motivated exclusively by events of 1915 and are simply killing Turks ''because of their ethnic identity'' in revenge for Turkish crimes of almost 70 years ago.
Actually, statements issued by these clandestine groups reveal that their acts are not motivated by revenge at all but are reactions to the policies of the present Turkish Government: its denial of the genocide, its continued occupation of western Armenia, its harassment of Armenians in Turkey and abroad and its refusal to even discuss any peaceful resolution of the Armenian question. These policies outrage all Armenians, the overwhelming majority of whom have obviously not resorted to violence but continue to actively demand some measure of justice.  In sharp contrast to modern Germany's attitudes and actions regarding the Holocaust, Turkey's present regime honors the memory of the mass murderer Talaat, and its diplomats have for decades been involved in a callous worldwide effort not only to deny and distort the truth about the Armenian genocide but also to block commemorations, like the building of memorials, even in the U.S. Indeed, evidence indicates that the earliest of violent Armenian actions against Turkey (in 1975) was in direct reaction to such Turkish provocations, particularly in the U.N.
Misrepresentation of the facts may reinforce the feeling that the Armenian question is shrouded by a conspiracy of silence or distortion, thereby possibly provoking further violence. Truth is critical, whether one is talking about the historic facts of 1915 or the more politically sensitive actions of 1983.
