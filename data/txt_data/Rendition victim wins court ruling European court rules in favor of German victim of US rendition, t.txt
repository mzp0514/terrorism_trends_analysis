PARIS (AP) - The European Court of Human Rights ruled today in favor of a German man who says the CIA illegally kidnapped him and took him to a secret prison in Afghanistan in 2003.
The decision was hailed by critics of the so-called extraordinary renditions programs in the U.S. war on terrorism.
It's Khaled El-Masri's first major judicial victory after trying in the U.S. and Europe to get authorities to recognize him as a victim.
He says he was kidnapped from Macedonia in 2003, mistaken for a terrorism suspect, then held and brutally interrogated at a prison run by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency for four months.
The European court, based in Strasbourg, France, ruled today that El-Masri's account was "established beyond reasonable doubt" and that Macedonia "had been responsible for his torture and ill-treatment both in the country itself and after his transfer to the U.S. authorities in the context of an extra-judicial rendition."
It said the government of Macedonia violated El-Masri's rights repeatedly and ordered it to pay 60,000 euro in damages.
Macedonian authorities said they would not comment until they are formally notified of the ruling. The Macedonian government has denied involvement in kidnapping.
Although the case focused on Macedonia, it drew broader attention because of how sensitive the CIA extraordinary renditions were for Europe. They involved abducting and interrogating terror suspects without court sanction in the years following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the U.S.
