MOSCOW -- In a sign of growing cooperation, NATO and Russian commanders discussed strategies Monday for fighting international terrorism.
With terrorism emerging as a global threat, "Russia finally found her place as an indispensable part of the Euro-Atlantic community," NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson said while opening a joint conference on military efforts to combat terrorism.
"This is an era when Russia and the member states of NATO finally set aside their mutual suspicions and outdated stereotypes and became serious about joining forces," he said.
The Russia-NATO conference highlighted the increasingly warm ties between Russia and its former Cold War foe, thanks to Russian President Vladimir Putin's firm support of the U.S.-led international campaign against terror.
"We have moved from talks to action," Putin said in a separate meeting with Robertson in the Kremlin. "Russia and NATO are very close in their assessment of military needs in the new security environment."
The closer Russian-NATO ties have helped muffle Moscow's protests about NATO's decision last month to invite seven new members, including three former Soviet republics in the Baltics, to join the alliance. Russian officials said that NATO's eastward expansion was unnecessary, but refrained from stronger criticism.
Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov said Monday that Moscow now expects the alliance's new members, particularly the Baltics, to join existing arms control agreements. "We don't want some kind of legal black hole to appear northwest of our country," Ivanov told reporters at the conference.
NATO officials said that it was up to individual members to decide what treaties to join.
