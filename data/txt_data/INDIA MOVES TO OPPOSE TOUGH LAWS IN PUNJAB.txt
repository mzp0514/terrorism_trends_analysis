The Indian Government today empowered the authorities in Punjab to detain people suspected of sabotage and terrorism for two years without a court trial.
The move, signed by President Zail Singh and announced in Parliament, was the latest measure to combat terrorists in the Punjab who have killed scores of Hindus, including two prominent politicians.

The action, an amendment to a preventive detention law, is valid only in the Punjab, Home Affairs Minister P. C. Sethi said. Elsewhere the detention law can be used to detain suspects for a maximum of one year.
Under the change, the Punjabi authorities must consult a special review body within 10 weeks of a detention. The committee of High Court judges and other officials can order the release of suspects after its review.
Late Tuesday, the Punjab Government declared the state a disturbed area, arming its security forces with powers to conduct searches and arrests without warrants and destroy terrorist camps and arms dumps. More than 300 people have died in the Punjab since a Sikh movement seeking greater political autonomy and religious freedom began in August 1982.
