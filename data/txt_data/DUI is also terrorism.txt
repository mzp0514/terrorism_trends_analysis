Terrorism is prevalent in our world. Unfortunately, terrorism also reigns in Utah.
Another innocent life, a teenager with a future full of hopes and dreams, was snuffed out on Saturday, Nov. 3, by a DUI driver at the wheel.
Perhaps a tragic death caused by an impaired driver ought to be reclassified as terrorism. I saw the look of grief and devastation on the many faces of those affected by the actions of one impaired driver. Unfortunately, this terrorism played out on the quiet streets of Taylorsville.
As chaplain with the Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office, it was my dubious duty to awaken family members in the middle of the night to inform them that their daughter, granddaughter, niece, cousin and/or friend had died. It is a heart-wrenching scene that need not, must not continue to happen! If only the impaired driver could see, firsthand, what I saw.
I attended the viewing and Holy Rosary of the young woman killed, I observed the viewing line, looking into the faces of hundreds who were impacted by the simple, yet tragic decision of one who chose to drive under the influence. I saw the anguish of family, fianc&#233; and friends. The mourners crossed many ethnic and socioeconomic lines. I saw children and the aged. I saw law enforcement officials, teachers, students, laborers and executives. All would have chosen to be elsewhere on that Tuesday night, rather than at a church mourning the loss of a friend.
Unfortunately, there are far too many who will relate to my description and emotions.
Driving under the influence. When will we end this war of terror?
