I don't understand why some people think the American system of justice is faulty. They appear to think that reading a terrorism suspect his or her Miranda rights is unwise.
Some may think, as columnist Charles Krauthammer appears to, that a terrorist will talk or not talk on the basis of whether he or she has been "Mirandized" ("For Safety's Sake, Forgo Miranda Until We Have All the Information," May 8). Isn't that a little silly? If you've just tried and failed to blow up New York City, it's not going to make any difference whether you have been read your rights or not. You'll talk or not talk for your own reasons.
Others seem to think that reading Miranda rights shows we are soft on terrorism. But wait a minute. Are we soft on murder? Rape? Armed robbery? After all, we read Miranda rights to people arrested for those crimes. I would think a process tough enough in those cases ought to be tough enough for terrorism as well.
Maybe the real problem is that our president is a Democrat. Some conservatives like to claim that all Democrats are constitutionally "soft on crime." They don't trust a Democratic administration to be adequately harsh, as if harshness were a measure of the excellence of a justice system.
The truth is that we do have a Constitution, and it has worked well for years. It tries to balance firmness and humanity. Maybe we should stop trying to find ways to legislate around our Constitution and just use it.
