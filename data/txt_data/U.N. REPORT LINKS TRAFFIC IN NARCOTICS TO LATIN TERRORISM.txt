Drug abuse remains a serious problem around the world, and in Latin America the narcotics trade finances gun running, terrorism and other crimes, said a United Nations report issued today.
''The abuse of a variety of drugs remains at a high level,'' said the International Narcotics Control Board's annual report.
''An ominous development is the apparent close connection between drug trafficking and the financing of other major criminal activities.''
It cited other United Nations findings linking drug dealing in unspecified parts of Latin America to ''the illegal traffic in firearms, subversion, international terrorism and other criminal activities.''
But it spoke positively of drug-control efforts by several Latin American nations, and it said the Brazilian Government was ''deeply concerned about the expanding illicit drug cultivation and trafficking.''
The report cited increases in the United States in the use of cocaine and ''designer drugs'' - chemicals that have effects like those of illegal substances but are often much deadlier.
But it said the percentage of young drug abusers might be decreasing in the United States and Western Europe.
The 13-member board of nongovernmental experts can submit recommendations to nations that have signed two conventions on narcotics but has no enforcement powers.
