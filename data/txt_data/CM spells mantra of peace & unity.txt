Sonowal pays tributes to October 30 serial blast victims
GUWAHATI, Oct 30: With militants' moral compass going awry in the State as they took to killing innocent people to sub serve their cause in the past Congress regime, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal has spelt the unity mantra to defeat such evil forces.
"We must stay united against terrorism and must defeat ill designs of all the forces inimical to the society's progress. Only peace can lead to development and harmony among all sections of society is a must for achieving lasting peace," Sonowal today said on Monday while participating at the observation of Black Day in memory of the victims of heinous bomb blast of October 30, 2008 at CJM Court premises at Kachari in the city and under the Ganeshguri Flyover, two places which had to bear the brunt of serial bomb blasts on that fateful day.       
Saying that last two Independence Day celebrations in the state saw people spontaneously coming out in large numbers to participate, Sonowal reiterated that law-and-order situation of the state has been gradually improving and that is why, investors have been showing interest to come to the state and set up bases. Assam has become a peaceful state and state's impression of being a highly progressive state has strongly been put in place outside the state as well, he said.
Extending his sympathies to the families of the victims, the Chief Minister said that the government is committed to look after the needs of the families and he urged the people to stay alert against any act of terrorism and cooperate with the government to realize the goal of a terrorism-free Assam. Not conflict but harmony is the need of the hour and people from all sections of the society must keep the age-old bond of unity intact, Sonowal said.   
Legal Adviser to the Chief Minister Shantanu Bharali, MLAs Atul Bora and Siddhartha Bhattacharjee, Guwahati Mayor Mrigen Sarania, Chief Secretary VK Pipersenia, DC Kamrup Metro M Angamuthu, Commissioner of Police of Guwahati Hiren Nath were also present in the programme.
