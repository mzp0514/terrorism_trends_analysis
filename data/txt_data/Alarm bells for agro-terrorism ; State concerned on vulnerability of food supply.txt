Athens --- Agro-terrorism, the potentially devastating country cousin to urban terrorism, may thrust rural veterinarians and agricultural extension agents into the unaccustomed role of "first defenders," according to experts in animal and plant diseases.
"None of us who grew up in the '50s and '60s going to Rock Eagle for FFA and 4-H camps could have imagined we would ever be first defenders against terrorists attacking our food supply," University of Georgia crisis management expert Michael McLendon said at a recent conference on agricultural security.
About 400 researchers, county agents, Farm Bureau representatives and other professionals in agricultural and animal diseases attended the May 23 conference where experts, including Dr. Lee Meyers, the state veterinarian, painted a stark picture of America's vulnerability to agricultural sabotage.
"One may first believe there are vast differences between a hijacked aircraft striking a New York City skyscraper and an attack on rural America," Myers said. "However, what better targets to strike than agriculture commodities and capabilities to provide safe food and fiber?"

The nation's highly efficient food processing system, which has produced the world's highest standard of living, also increases the risk of spreading contamination, Myers said. "Components of as many as 100 eggs can contribute to a single processed omelet, protein from 100 cattle can be in a hamburger patty, and a thousand chickens can be represented in a single chicken frank."
Add to that the nation's "just in time" food distribution system, which allows most cities to maintain no more than five days' food supply, and agriterrorists have the ability to do tremendous damage, Myers said.
Concerns voiced at the meeting echoed those of U.S. Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge, who recently said seaports, which handle most of the nation's imported grains and produce, and domestic food and water supplies are at the top of his list of unmet concerns.
In Georgia, the top concerns include sabotage of the state's No. 1 agricultural commodity, poultry, which accounts for exports worth more than $300 million annually.
Unlike natural disasters such as hurricanes, which can be tracked ahead of their arrival, agro-terrorism events are preceded by no warning, McLendon said. They may also be difficult to detect, and it may be difficult to distinguish natural and accidental occurrences from the terrorist-initiated. The problem is further complicated by the vast diversity of agricultural targets, which include animals, plants, food processing and distribution systems, he said.
"As a result, agro-terrorism planning and response create a more complex command and control, as well as complex incident command environment, than usually encountered during natural disaster events," McLendon said.
The conference, held the week after Gov. Roy Barnes signed a state agricultural security law, was the first event sponsored by UGA's new 30-member Agro-Terrorism Task Force.
Task force co-Chairman Jeff Fisher, who heads UGA's environmental health science department, said the purpose of the gathering was to raise awareness of agro-terrorism among front line agricultural professionals and recruit them for a statewide effort to speed the reporting of plant and animal diseases.
UGA is the site of one of eight centers for domestic preparedness funded by the CDC to develop standards for dealing with bioterrorism. Cham Dallas heads the university center that is developing national standards for pharmacology, emergency medicine and agro-terrorism.
To accomplish the task, Dallas has enlisted the help of researchers at Emory University, Georgia Tech and the Medical College of Georgia.
"The cooperative agreements are one of the things I'm most proud of," Dallas said during a tour of a laboratory where toxic agents are tested. Dallas, who studied the effects of radiation from the 1986 explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine, said the aftermath of agro-terrorism could dwarf those of the world's worst nuclear disaster.
On Friday, federal officials announced that Georgia will receive $2.3 million to combat agro-terrorism. Of that amount, $2 million will go to programs for rapid detection and diagnosis of plant and animal diseases.
The money is considered a wise investment against diseases that could cost hundreds of times that amount.
Agriculture is Georgia's largest industry, representing an economic impact of $5.7 billion annually. Poultry production, including meat and eggs, contributes about $2.7 billion. Other significant agricultural products are cotton, peanuts, cattle and tobacco.
"Georgia's continued economic vitality is dependent upon freedom from disease, pests and disruption of commerce," Myers said. "An agro-terror attack could quickly devastate trade, induce social instability and erode public confidence."
An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Britain in 2001 cost the British economy $20 billion and effectively ended that country's beef export trade. A study by Georgia officials found that a single cow infected with foot-and-mouth disease could cost the state's economy more than $3 billion.
Despite large sums of new money being spent to improve agricultural safety, the nation's food supply remains vulnerable, public health authority Stephen O. Cunnion wrote in the May issue of the Journal of Homeland Defense. The results could be devastating.
"Hysteria could overburden all social, economic and governmental systems, resulting in anarchy and bringing economic production to a standstill," Cunnion said. "We have seen what a few ounces of anthrax can do to our postal system."
