Saudi Arabia's crown prince called Saturday for the establishment of a worldwide center to share intelligence on terrorism. Crown Prince Abdullah spoke at a conference hosted by a country often accused of exporting militants.
Abdullah, who is the kingdom's de facto leader and has led a tough campaign against militant groups over the past year, said a global intelligence-sharing center could allow experts and officials worldwide to "exchange information instantly" to prevent attacks.
Saudi Arabia is already thought to exchange information with the United States, but the kingdom has been criticized for failing to openly disclose the steps it takes internally to uproot al-Qaida's structure in the kingdom.
The desert kingdom is accused by some in the West of not doing enough to stop the departure of militants from Saudi Arabia to other countries, including Iraq.
The Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, said the conference was meant to be a Saudi contribution to the anti-terrorism fight -- not a public relations effort. Saudi Arabia is the the birthplace of terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden and 15 of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers.
The conference was attended by delegates from the United States, Britain and more than 50 countries.
Syria and Iran disputed what they called inaccurate definitions of terrorism.
A member of the Iranian foreign ministry, Ali Abul Hasani, said people fighting for their freedom under occupation should be considered differently than those who kill innocent civilians.
