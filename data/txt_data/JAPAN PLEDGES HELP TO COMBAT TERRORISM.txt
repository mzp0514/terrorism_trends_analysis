WASHINGTON (AP) -- Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi met Tuesday with President Bush and promised transportation and humanitarian help in the event of U.S.-led military action against terrorist organizations.
Bush expressed appreciation for Japan's support as his administration also welcomed backing from Italy's foreign minister and a decision by Saudi Arabia to cut diplomatic ties with the Taliban movement in Afghanistan, further isolating the radical Islamic militia.
Secretary of State Colin Powell and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld spent 21/2 hours on Capitol Hill, giving top-secret briefings in meetings with senators and House members.
"We're very pleased at the support we have received from the Senate," Powell said after briefing senators.
Koizumi was the fourth leader of an allied country to visit the White House in a week. Echoing the sentiments of the earlier visitors, the Japanese leader said after an hour-long meeting with Bush that his country "stands by the United States to fight terrorists."
The Saudis explained the break in relations by saying the Taliban was defaming Islam by harboring and supporting terrorists.
Later, Italian Foreign Minister Renato Ruggiero met separately with Vice President Dick Cheney and Powell. He said Italy is prepared to send troops, if necessary, or offer other kinds of support to combat terrorism.
