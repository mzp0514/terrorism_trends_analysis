After two terrorist bombings in Europe last week and the international attention that followed, Americans now call terrorism the most important problem facing the nation, according to a New York Times/CBS News Poll completed Thursday night.
Fifteen percent of the 1,601 adults interviewed from Sunday to Thursday said terrorism was the nation's biggest problem, far more than have cited it before.
The percentage increased steadily as the telephone survey continued, reaching 21 percent of those interviewed on Wednesday and on Thursday, the day after President Reagan's news conference.
No other problem was named by as many respondents in the telephone poll, although 11 percent cited the economy and 11 percent mentioned unemployment.
Earlier, a Times Poll of 1,354 adults conducted by telephone from Dec. 14 to 18 found only 1 percent naming terrorism. An in-person Gallup Poll of 1,540 adults from Jan. 10 to 13, after the terrorist attacks at the Rome and Vienna airports Dec. 27, found terrorism cited by 6 percent. All three polls had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
The latest poll also showed that 62 percent of the public thought that the bombing of the Trans World Airlines jet near Athens last week, in which four Americans were killed, was carried out in retaliation for United States naval actions off the coast of Libya.
This poll also followed the bombing of a West Berlin discotheque last Saturday.
