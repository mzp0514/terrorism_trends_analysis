President Reagan's action in Libya was an appropriate response to actual and planned acts of war against the US. Indeed, significantly larger applications of force are called for in the form of a naval and air blockade of Libya.
Critics miss a number of key points. ''Responding to the root causes of terrorism'' is not a sufficient alternative. There are no root causes of terrorism except blind hatred and venom. We cannot just say, ''Carry on killing our citizens while we urge Israel to evacuate the West Bank,'' for the following reasons:
* It says that the pressure of terrorism is achieving policy objectives; in other words, ''keep it up.''
* The issues are usually nonnegotiable. What do you negotiate about? That the terrorists kill you tomorrow instead of today? Kill you instead of your family?
* No one in Libya is advocating Israeli evacuation of the West Bank - but the destruction of the state of Israel.
* Submission to and toleration of those who have killed or threatened to kill Arab moderates who want to negotiate with Israel do nothing to help the peace process in the region.
