Reading the names of 11 Fox Valley women who were killed in acts of domestic violence, Sharon Burner of the Community Crisis Center of Elgin said such "terrorism at home" must stop.  
"The loss of these lives â€¦ diminishes us as a community," Burner said Saturday during the annual Men Standing with Women against Domestic Violence rally at Elgin's Lords Park. "But there is always hope."  
Burner joined more than 100 people for the rally, which included songs of peace by Patti Ecker, balloons and games for kids, messages against domestic violence and social service agencies offering information about abuse by one family member against another.  
Lisa West, president of the Community Crisis Center's board of directors, thanked the facility's workers and volunteers who provide safe shelter, emotional support, treatment and resources to the many women, children and men who are victims of domestic violence. And she thanked the rally's sponsors, Sherman and Provena St. Joseph hospitals, for helping to educate people about the crimes that injure and kill so many.  
"Domestic violence and partner abuse will not be tolerated in our community," West said. "It is a problem that affects us all."  
Showing just how widespread domestic violence is in the Fox Valley and nationwide, crisis center volunteers at Saturday's rally hung up on clotheslines more than 300 T-shirts designed by survivors of domestic violence.  
And for the first time in the rally's history, the crisis center displayed a "Silent Witness" exhibit, which shows life-size silhouettes representing 28 women and one man from Chicago and the suburbs who lost their lives to domestic violence.  
Among those in the Fox Valley who were recognized in the "Silent Witness" display were:  
- Hristina Vladimirov, 42, of Burlington, strangled in her house in March 2000.  
- Delma Soto, 24, of Elgin, stabbed in March 1998.  
- Cathie S. Gostele, 43, of Elgin, stabbed 12 times in November 1995.  
- Janika Lovelace, 19, of Elgin, shot in the head in September 1994.  
- Celia Cruz, 48, and her 14-year-old daughter, Rubi Gutierrez, both of Elgin, shot in June 2001.  
- Blanca Lopez, 42, of Elgin, shot in February 2002.  
- Tracey Boyer, 28, of Elgin, strangled and stabbed in November 1994.  
- Joan Bierdz, 37, of Elgin, stabbed in her driveway in August 1999.
