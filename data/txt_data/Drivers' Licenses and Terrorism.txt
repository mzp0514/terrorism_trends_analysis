To the Editor:
   In ''No Number, No Ride'' (Sept. 12), you report: ''Since January, the Motor Vehicles Department has sent out roughly 500,000 letters threatening to suspend the licenses of drivers whose Social Security numbers do not match federal records.'' 
  This is the reality of the so-called war on terrorism. In order to create a sense of security, busboys and day workers lose the right to a driver's license and the means to get to their jobs and provide for their families.
  Forget that they pay taxes. Forget that they do the jobs in Westchester that no one else wants to do, and forget that they and their families may have been in this country many years before 9/11. Because instead of an intelligence community that can't live up to its description, and pseudo-allies that can't or won't cooperate with the anti-terror agenda, the Bush administration has to make a show of somebody. Preferably, somebody who isn't likely to visit a polling place in the near future.
   Influential support for the alien community will not be easy to find. Many of the homeowners of Westchester County look upon the immigrant population as an inexhaustible commodity.
   To the extent that neither Democrats nor Republicans have a solution to the problem of terror or a willingness to admit it, they are the same.
