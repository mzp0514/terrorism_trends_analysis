Dennis Alan Riggs, a felon who the FBI fears is a potential mass shooter, waived indictment and pleaded guilty by video Wednesday to a federal gun possession charge that will land him in prison.
Riggs, 51, of Troy Hill, isn't allowed to have guns, but had his partner, a retired Social Security administrative law judge, buy an AR-15 for him.
The judge, Karl Alexander, 79, of Grove City, has also pleaded guilty to acting as a straw buyer and is now also a federal felon.
He said Riggs, his boyfriend since 1997, had been asking him for years to buy the assault weapon for him. He didn't because he was still a judge, but after he retired finally agreed.
The pair went to Ace Sporting Goods in Washington County on Sept. 29, 2018, where Riggs picked the weapon and Alexander bought it, lying on a required federal firearms form.
Riggs was convicted in 1994 of aggravated assault.
The FBI's terrorism unit raided his house Jan. 22.
They found the AR-15, six other guns, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, knives, daggers and hundreds of bottles of alcohol.
The house was also filled with Nazi banners, flags and pictures of Adolf Hitler in almost every room.
U.S. District Judge Robert Colville said he'd sentence Riggs in September.
