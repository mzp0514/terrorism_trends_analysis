LONDON -- Police in Britain arrested 12 men yesterday in early-morning raids that they said were necessary to head off a potential terrorist attack. 
John Yates, the assistant commissioner of Scotland Yard, declined to give details of any alleged plot but said that the men were all detained "on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism" in Britain. 
It was the largest such sweep in the country since April 2009, when authorities across northern England arrested a dozen men for alleged involvement in what officials called a "very big" and imminent terrorist attack. All 12 suspects were released two weeks later for lack of evidence, an embarrassing turn for law enforcement. 
Yates insisted yesterday that the new sweep was unavoidable, carefully planned and based on actionable intelligence. 
"With the information we had, I believe today's arrests were absolutely necessary in order to keep the public safe," he said. 
The suspects, who range in age from 17 to 28, were, with one exception, arrested about 5 a.m. at or near their homes in London, in the northern English city of Stoke-on-Trent and in Cardiff, the capital of Wales. One man was arrested away from home in Birmingham, in central England.
