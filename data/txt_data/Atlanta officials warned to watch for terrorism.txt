LAUSANNE, Switzerland - With 4+ months left before the Centennial Games, the International Olympic Committee told Atlanta organizers Wednesday to guard against two main dangers: politics and terrorism.
Concerns over the U.S.-Cuba dispute, the China-Taiwan dispute and recent deadly bombings in Israel dominated the talks between the IOC and the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games.
The IOC pressed ACOG President Billy Payne for assurances that security measures will be sufficient. "We felt it important to tell the IOC we are doing everything humanly possible with the assistance of state and local law enforcement officials to make the environment at the Games secure," Payne said.
The IOC is concerned over tensions between the United States and Cuba after the recent downing of two unarmed planes by Cuban fighter jets near the Cuban coast. Meantime, China considers Taiwan a renegade province and has hinted it might boycott the Games if Taiwanese political leaders are invited. Payne said no political leaders have been specifically invited.
Payne also said a drug-testing machine considered three times more effective than standard equipment will be used at this summer's Games. The high resolution mass spectrometer can detect steroid use up to three months previously.
