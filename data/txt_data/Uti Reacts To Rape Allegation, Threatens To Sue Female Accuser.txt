 SAN FRANCISCO, June 04, (THEWILL)  Nigerian reality TV star and actor, Uti Nwachukwu, has reacted to a rape allegation levelled against him by a lady, Kambili Korie, who claims he raped her a few years back. Reacting, Uti, the former Big Brother Africa winner, who described his accuser as faceless and a troll, gave her a 3-day ultimatum to file her complaint at a police station insisting the allegation is false.
 THEWILL will notes that the accuser's twitter handle (@KambiliKorie) was opened in February 2020 and the Instagram handle also appears to be new too and has a single post. "I reject this characterization and deny this baseless allegation in the strongest terms possible.
 Furthermore, I am urging this faceless victim to report this purported crime to the nearest police station.  "I am willing to pay for all the fees you incur in reporting this alleged crime if after 3 days u fail to disclose yourself or report the crime, I shall proceed to report the case and the blogs and other internet host spreading this fake news to the inspector general of police for cyber terrorism and Libel.
" He also blasted media houses that have reported the false claims without verification. He concluded: "I am appalled and disgusted that blogs are too lazy to properly investigate baseless claims before putting up badly scripted and edited posts on their pages all for numbers they get from the back and forth drama.
 Shame. "How do you put up posts from a faceless twitter page created months ago? You put up fabricated and photo shopped chats and tweets doctored by these mindless trolls without proper investigation? Once again dear faceless victim, 3 days and your time starts now.
"
