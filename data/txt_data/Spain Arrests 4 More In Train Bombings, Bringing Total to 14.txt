Four more suspects were arrested in the train bombings on March 11 that killed 202 people and injured hundreds, officials said Monday. The four men, described as being of Arabic origin, were taken in police raids over the weekend.
 So far, 14 people have been arrested in connection with the bombings, with 9 formally charged and one released.
 Early Tuesday, the judge in charge of the case at the Spanish High Court, Juan del Olmo, decided to bring formal charges against three Moroccans and a Spaniard who had been arrested earlier. A fifth man, a Moroccan, was released without condition.
 The bombings in Madrid have strengthened resolve across Europe to join forces in fighting terrorism. At a meeting of European Union interior and justice ministers on Friday, it was agreed to set up a regionwide terrorism coordinator.
 In the same spirit of cooperation, senior Spanish intelligence officials welcomed their counterparts from Britain, France, Germany and Italy in Madrid on Monday to update them on the investigation of the latest attacks and discuss ways to pool information more efficiently.
 Also on Monday, European Union foreign ministers gathered in Brussels for talks dominated by the joint fight against terrorism.
 Spain plans to hold a state funeral for the victims of the train bombings on Wednesday.
