ISLAMABAD - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton faced sharp rebukes from Pakistani audiences Friday, including one woman who accused the U.S. of conducting "executions without trial" in aerial drone strikes. Slapping back, Clinton questioned Pakistan's commitment to fighting terrorists. 
"Somebody, somewhere in Pakistan must know where these people are," Clinton said in an exchange almost as blunt as her exasperated comments a day earlier suggesting that Pakistani officials lacked the will to target al-Qaida. Her stormy three-day visit, rocked at the start by a terrorist blast in Peshawar that killed 105 Pakistanis, revealed clear signs of strain between the two nations despite months of public insistence that they were on the same wavelength in the war on terror. By speaking bluntly about the Pakistanis' failure to find and eliminate top al-Qaida leaders - eight years after they were run out of Afghanistan - Clinton appeared to be trying to prod the Pakistanis to go beyond their current military campaign against internal militants in South Waziristan. During a live broadcast of an interview before a predominantly female audience of several hundred, Clinton struggled to avoid describing the classified U.S. effort to target terrorists, and still try to explain the efforts of American foreign policy. One woman asked Clinton how she would define terrorism. "Is it the killing of people in drone attacks?" the woman asked. Then she asked if Clinton considered both the U.S. missile strikes and militant bombings like the one that killed more than 100 civilians in the city of Peshawar earlier in the week as acts of terrorism. "No, I do not," Clinton replied.
