NEW YORK - U.S. authorities believe a prominent Yemeni politician roamed the city in late 1999 to secretly raise money for terrorist operations, according to testimony in a federal case.
The allegations against Sheik Abdullah Satar were made public for the first time this week at the trial of Numan Maflahi, a Yemen-born convenience store owner charged with making false statements about the alleged fund-raising scheme.
During a four-day visit in late 1999, Satar was escorted by Maflahi, 31, as he collected donations - purportedly for an orphan charity - at mosques in Brooklyn and Manhattan, FBI agent Brian Murphy testified.
The charity, Murphy alleged, was a front for radical Muslim groups.
News accounts describe Satar, who has not been charged, as an outspoken opposition party leader in Yemen who has opposed the decision to allow U.S. forces to enter the country to train troops to combat terrorists after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
When the FBI confronted Maflahi about Satar last year, the defendant said he knew the sheik was a famous figure in his homeland, "like Hillary Clinton," Murphy told jurors.
But he allegedly insisted he had only met Satar in passing and denied helping him raise money - the basis for the false-statement charge.
Maflahi's attorney, Hassen Ibn Abdellah, reminded jurors that his client was not charged with any terror-related counts. He accused prosecutors of repeatedly mentioning terrorism "to inflame you, to prejudice you, to make you feel unpatriotic."
If convicted, Maflahi could face up to five years in prison.
