Italy's president on Friday pardoned a United States Air Force colonel convicted in absentia by Italian courts in 2009 for the abduction of an Egyptian terrorism suspect from a Milan street in an operation conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency. The office of President Giorgio Napolitano said he hoped that the pardoning of the American, Col. Joseph L. Romano, would ease a ''delicate'' situation between the two allies, which cooperate closely on security matters. Colonel Romano was security chief of the Aviano air base in northern Italy, where the abducted Egyptian Muslim cleric was taken before being flown out of the country and eventually to Egypt. The trial was the first in the world involving the C.I.A.'s extraordinary rendition program to abduct terrorism suspects and transfer them to third countries where torture is permitted. The cleric, Osama Moustafa Hassan Nasr, was abducted in 2003 in Milan, where he lived while seeking asylum in Italy. He was taken to Aviano, then transferred to an American military base in Germany before being flown to Egypt, where, he said, he was tortured. He was eventually released. Twenty-three Americans were convicted in Milan, all in absentia; Colonel Romano was the only one who was not a C.I.A. employee.
