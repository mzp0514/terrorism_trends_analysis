Editor, New Era:
This letter concerns the article on Sept. 5th's back page, "Fading Flags: Public patriotism has dwindled here."
First, let me say that I love Mr. DeCarlton's painted red, white and blue house on School House Road.

But I disagree with Mr. Mearig's quote, "The concern is not there." Trust me the concern is here. It is a scary time we are living in. With the approach of Sept. 11th, I so much have the desire to stay home from work and keep my child home from schoolâ€¦  to stay huddled together with my family and loved ones.
I often think about the shock of the ordeal of having our country attacked. I, for one, very stupidly never thought our country would be attacked. I will never forget last Sept. 11th, nor do I want to forget. We can't forget!
However, the dwindling of flags might be that like your top article (same back page) suggests: "The public's confidence in the war on terrorism is slipping!" I think a lot of people perhaps do not want to see more people killed. War is ugly.
It's ugly, but so was Sept. 11th! Others are worried about playing a cat and mouse game. It is just a very scary time.
But do we still love America? You bet! And we can only hope that God watches over us all.
