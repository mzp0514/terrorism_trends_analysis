The House is scheduled to vote today on legislation to extend expiring
tax cuts and the government's terrorism insurance program.
The tax package contains $56.1 billion of cuts, including preserved rate
reductions on capital gains and dividends, as well as an exemption that
financial services companies receive on foreign earnings. A competing bill
the Senate passed last month would not extend these cuts.
The House is also set to vote on a bill that would keep the terrorism
insurance program in place through 2007 but narrow its scope considerably, so
that insurers would have to cover a larger share of claims.
Under current law, the government would have had to pay claims of over $5
million. Under the House bill and a similar one the Senate approved last
month, taxpayers' obligation would kick in on claims of over $50 million next
year and over $100 million in 2007.
On Thursday a House Financial Services subcommittee is scheduled to hold
a hearing on housing issues in the areas ravaged by hurricanes Katrina and
Rita.
Though the House returned from its extended Thanksgiving recess this
week, the Senate will reconvene Monday. Both chambers are expected to recess
later this month.
