A leading private investigative agency plans to open an office in St. Louis within 30 days.  The company, The Fairfax Group Ltd., is based in suburban Washington and has international operations.
''We are an international management consulting firm which conducts investigations and security programs,'' Michael J. Hershman, president of Fairfax, said in a telephone interview.  He said the new office is the result of expanding business in St. Louis.  Initially, the office will have five investigators. ''We will be concentrating mainly on Missouri at first, but we hope to expand'' regionally, Hershman said.  Established in 1983, Fairfax currently has 175 employees and another 100 part-time contractors world-wide.  ''We do a lot of white-collar investigations involving embezzlement, the theft of trade secrets and infringement of patent rights,'' Hershman said.  ''We also do 'diligence checks,' '' Hershman said. ''Like when a company is preparing to take over another firm, we check and make sure the people are honest and have good credit.'' Hershman said the company does ''asset tracing'' for banking, brokerage and fraud investigations. Counter-terrorism, executive protection services and airport security are major fields for Fairfax.  ''We do work for both private companies and for governments,'' Hershman said.
