Apr. 12--GREENSBORO -- Enterprise Risk Management is a revolution in the insurance world.
The fundamental shift in the way businesses must approach risk was spurred by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina, said Ellen Thrower, executive director of The School of Risk Management at St. John's University in New York.
"They've changed forever the conceptof extreme risk," she said of 9/11and Hurricane Katrina.
Thrower gave a speech, "Managing Risk in a Changing World," on Wednesday as the 2007 Kathleen Bryan Price Lecturer at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.
ERM is hard to define, she said, but identifies risks for businesses, higher education and individuals in advance and proactively develop measures to comply with regulations. "There really isn't any consensus definition," Thrower said.
"It's a lot of different things to a lot of different people."
She predicted in three years, ERM will be the standard way of looking at risk management.
"But some risks are beyond the scope of individuals, risk managers or the government," she said. "Terrorism is such a risk. Our biggest risk management concern today is terrorism."
"It is not something a consultant can do," she said. "It's a mind-set change. It's something that's cultural and really takes some time."
