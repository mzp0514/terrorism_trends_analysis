MIAMI , Convicted terrorism plotter Jose Padilla's resentencing was postponed by a federal judge on Wednesday when his defense attorney argued Padilla is deteriorating psychologically after years of isolation and needs more time for family visits. 
Attorney Michael Caruso said Padilla's family in South Florida has been able to visit him only one time since 2008 at the Supermax prison in Florence, Colo., where he is kept in solitary confinement 23 hours a day and allowed no contact with other inmates. 
Now that Padilla, 42, is back at a Miami detention center, his mother and brothers can see him more regularly and perhaps improve his mental condition, Caruso told U.S. District Judge Marcia Cooke at a hearing. He did not elaborate on Padilla's mental issues. 
"It would be beneficial. It is in his best interest to continue the sentencing," Caruso said. 
At one point, Caruso called the harsh prison conditions akin to torture, which was rejected by Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Frazier. 
"He is not in some black hole of Calcutta," Frazier said. 
Cooke, however, agreed to postpone the resentencing hearing from next Monday to Jan. 29. A new sentence must be imposed because the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Padilla's original 17-year sentence was too lenient for a trained al-Qaida operative who also had a long criminal record as a Chicago gang member. 
Among other things, Cooke gave Padilla credit for more than three years he was imprisoned without criminal charge in a South Carolina Navy brig as an enemy combatant.
