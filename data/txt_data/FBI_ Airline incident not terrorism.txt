A man once charged with a hijacking rushed the cockpit of a South African Airlines jet en route to Atlanta on Thursday morning, the FBI says.
The incident was not a terrorist attempt, an FBI Atlanta spokesman said.

James Barrett Drake, 53, had been arrested in San Francisco on a hijacking charge in 1987 but later found mentally incompetent to stand trial, says an FBI complaint filed in court Thursday.
At 6 a.m. Thursday, Drake climbed to the upper deck of Flight 7799, looked at two passengers and said something to the effect of, "You're going to get me for this, but I've got to do it," an FBI affidavit says.
Drake then began banging on the cockpit door with his fists and trying to open it, the affidavit says.
Drake also shouted to the cockpit crew to let him in. Drake was restrained by two passengers --- a deputy sheriff from Reno, Nev., and a doctor --- who were sitting near the cockpit door, the FBI said.
Drake told investigators in Atlanta he was running from people who were trying to kill him, the affidavit says.
The flight originated in Cape Town; the incident occurred over international waters. After Drake was subdued, the flight had no problem, landing at 8:30 a.m.
Drake was charged with three counts of interfering with a flight crew, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years. U.S. Magistrate Janet King ordered Drake to be evaluated at the Federal Correctional Institute in Butner, N.C.
