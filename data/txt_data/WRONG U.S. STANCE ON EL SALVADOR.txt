To the Editor:
 As one who has spent much of his professional career closely connected with Latin America, I fear that the Administration's policy toward El Salvador will have an effect exactly opposite to the containment of Communism, not only in El Salvador but in all of Central and South America.
eaching in Chile and on more than a dozen expeditions to Peru has brought me into intimate contact with Latin Americans of all social classes and political tendencies.
Adams Carter letter expresses fear of long-range effects Reagan ADministration's foreign policy toward El Salvador will have on containment of CommunismSupporting militarily an oligarchy invariably backfires. It would be beneficial to give economic support to certain elements of the Government of El Salvador with the proviso that social reforms and land reform, coupled with respect for civil rights, continue and that terrorism of the right cease.
Another important point is the effect of our interference with or military support of El Salvador's Government. If we aid a regime that does not respect the civil rights of many of its citizens, how can we object if Moscow moves to aid Poland's Government against the Polish people?  ADAMS CARTER Milton, Mass., Feb. 24, 1981
