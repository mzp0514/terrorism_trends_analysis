In characterizing the speech given by President Obama at the National Prayer Breakfast as not speaking out against terrorism, in his letter to the editor, Mr. Willman is doing a disservice to the president and to TH readers who are misled by Mr. Willman`s comments (Feb. 13).
I encourage everyone to read the actual content of his speech at tinyurl.com/la7atho.
Mr. Willman said the president berated Christians instead of terrorists. In the speech, there is one sentence referring to the Crusades. It is not berating Christians for the Crusades, but is reminding us that, historically, even Christians have done terrible things in the name of God.
"Humanity has been grappling with these questions throughout human history. And lest we get on our high horse and think this (terrorism) is unique to some other place, remember that during the Crusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ." In the next sentence,he mentions in our country which some justified in the name of Christ. Two sentences out of the whole speech refer to historical acts in the name of Christ that remind us we Christians are not totally innocent.
In the rest of the speech, President Obama says we all have a responsibility to speak out against acts of terrorism carried out anywhere, by anyone. He defends freedom of speech and religion, and separation of church and state in this country.
