To the Editor:
Now that the heat resulting from the attack on the USS Cole has died a little I wish the press would be more discriminating in defining "terrorism" and "terrorists."
In the American Heritage Dictionary "terrorism" is defined as "the unlawful use or threatened use of force or violence by a person or an organized group against people or property with the intention of intimidating or coercing societies or governments, often for ideological or political reasons."
#CARTER.OCT00#Terrorists are people engaged in terrorism.
Popular use of the term "terrorism" leaves an impression that it is a law enforcement problem that can be solved by good investigation, indictment, arrest and trial through the criminal justice system.
The attack on the USS Cole, as well as the previous attack on the Air Force quarters in Saudi Arabia, was not intended to intimidate or coerce. They were both well-planned, well-executed military attacks on U.S. forces actively engaged in enforcing our sanctions policy with Iraq.
Our country should not treat attacks on our forces as something to be dealt with by the FBI and the courts. We do not indict and try the troops of an enemy that attacks us. We annihilate them.
