 BEVERLY HILLS, September 03, (THEWILL) President Muhammadu Buhari has said that Nigeria will re-examine the closure of her embassy in Colombo in 2017 in view of the important relationship the country has with Sri Lanka. Speaking at a farewell audience granted the outgoing High Commissioner of the Democratic Republic of Sri Lanka, His Excellency Thambirajah Raveenthiran at the State House, Abuja, Tuesday the President explained that financial challenges which the country faced at the time informed the closure of some Nigerian embassies and consulates during a rationalisation exercise.
 Buhari's spokesman, Garba Shehu said in a statement that the president assured that his administration will take another look at that decision as it affected Sri Lanka following the request by the outgoing High Commissioner. President Buhari wished Mr.
 Raveenthiran success in his future undertakings. In his remarks, the outgoing High Commissioner said he had spent four out of his 30-year career in diplomatic service in Nigeria.
 He said his period in Nigeria was remarkable in several ways, stressing that he enjoyed the support and cooperation of Nigerians, and was greatly assisted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Mr.
 Raveenthiran said that his country has a lot to offer Nigeria in the areas of counter-terrorism, medical tourism and higher education.
