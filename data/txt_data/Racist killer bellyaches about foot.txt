Body


The hate-filled white supremacist who fatally stabbed a homeless black man in Times Square with such force his weapon bent whined on Friday that he couldn't show up in court because his foot hurt.
James Jackson, 30, an Army veteran from Baltimore, was expected to take a plea deal after confessing three months ago to the murder of Tim Caughman on March 20, 2017.
Caughman's death was meant to be the first in a spree of hate attacks around the city, Jackson told cops.
But instead of appearing in Manhattan Criminal Court, Jackson sent Justice Laura Ward a note telling her he couldn't appear for at least a month thanks to a broken foot.
"I broke my foot in several places on Wednesday the 19th," Justice Ward said, reading the letter aloud.
Ward was not amused, and the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said it would order Jackson to show up at his next court date Jan. 4.
Jackson said he would not object to the order.
That day could bring a swift end to the case, as Jackson is expected to plead guilty to murder as terrorism charges.
Earlier this month Jackson listened as Ward said the confession he made in September will be heard by the jury if the case goes to trial.
Jackson told cops in chilling detail how he stabbed Caughman in the back with an 18-inch sword as he sifted through a trash can for bottles.
"It was a downward stab. He freaked the f-k out and started screaming. He scared the hell out of me," Jackson said in his videotaped confession. "So I stabbed him a couple more times in the chest."
He later told detectives he hated mixed-race couples, though Caughman was alone when Jackson murdered him.
