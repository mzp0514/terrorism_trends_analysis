Mohamed Sheikh Abdirahman Kariye was one of the plaintiffs.
The federal government violated the rights of 13 people who were placed on its no-fly list by giving them no way to challenge the designation, a federal judge in Oregon ruled Tuesday, in what is the _irst such decision about the classi-_ication created to _ight terrorism.
The no-fly list, established after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, is designed to prevent air travel to or from the United States by those whom the government suspects of having ties to terrorism.
In the current suit, 13 Muslim-American plaintiffs - four of them veterans of the U.S. military - denied having any links to terrorism and said they only learned of their no-fly status when they arrived at an airport and were blocked from boarding a flight.
In a 65-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Anna Brown held that the government had violated the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs because there was no effective way for them to challenge the government's decision. She ordered both sides to come up with new procedures that would allow those who felt they were improperly on the list to raise questions about their inclusion.
The ruling brought praise from the winners.
"For years, in the name of national security the government has argued for blanket secrecy and judicial deference to its profoundly unfair no-fly list procedures, and those arguments have now been resoundingly rejected by the court," said ACLU National Security Project Director Hina Shamsi, one of the attorneys who argued the case.
"Our clients will _inally get the due process to which they are entitled under the Constitution."
