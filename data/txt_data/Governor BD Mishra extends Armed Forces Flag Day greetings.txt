Itanagar: Governor Brig (retd) Dr BD Mishra on Friday extended his greetings to the people of the State on the occasion of the Armed Forces Flag Day.

He also conveyed his good wishes to his former colleagues in arms.

In his message to the people on the occasion, the Governor said that since 1949, the Indian Armed Forces Flag Day is observed every year on December 7 to honour the soldiers, airmen and sailors of India who are guarding the borders to safeguard country's sovereignty, integrity and honour.

"While combating the ongoing cross-border terrorism and insurgency many members of our Armed Forces are making the supreme sacrifice and laying down their life. Many of them lose their limbs and become disabled. The Flag Day brings to the fore the country's obligation for the welfare of the armed forces people and those who have given their day for the nation," he said in his message.

"On the occasion, the Governor appealed to each and every citizen of the country to generously donate to the Armed Forces Flag Day Fund, which is used for the welfare of the battle martyrs, veer naris, war-disabled, the ex-servicemen and the serving personnel.

"We are proud of our valiant armed forces," Dr Mishra said while joining the people of the state in paying gratitude to the members of Indian Armed Forces for their courage, bravery, valour, patriotism and sacrifice for the national cause.
