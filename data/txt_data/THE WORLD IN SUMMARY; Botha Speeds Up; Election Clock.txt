Although Prime Minister P.W. Botha has done nothing to alter the basic inequality of South Africa's black majority, his occasional hints that someday he might have provoked a backlash among even more conservative whites. To strengthen his leadership of the ruling National Party against these so-called ''verkramptes,'' Mr. Botha last week scheduled general elections for April 29, 18 months before they are required.

By way of starting the campaign, South African commandos crossed into neighboring Mozambique for the first time, to attack the operational headquarters of the outlawed African National Congress.  Announcing the nighttime raid, Gen. Constant Viljoen of Pretoria's Defense Forces said it was carried out because the congress was using Mozambique as ''a springboard for terrorism against South Africa.''
The Government said it killed 30 guerrillas and seized large quantities of arms at the loss of two soldiers. A Western diplomat in Maputo, the Mozambican capital, said the bodies of five insurgents had been mutilated, with an ear cut off each one.
The oldest South African nationalist movement, founded in 1912, the African National Congress was banned in South Africa in 1960 and set up operations in black-ruled countries. Swelled by new exiles after the Soweto riots of 1976, the organization has been responsible since for sporadic sabotage and small-scale terrorist attacks. Its last raid, in May, destroyed three oil storage tanks at a coal conversion plant outside Johannesburg.
