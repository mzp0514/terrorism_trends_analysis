Round Lake Area Exchange Club has announced a November Hometown Hero as part of an ongoing program.
U.S. Air Force Airman First Class Kathryn Nettleton, an 18-year Round Lake Beach resident, has been tabbed for this month's honor.
Nettleton is a 2009 graduate from Grayslake North High School and a member of the American Legion in Fox Lake.
Nettleton has served for almost three years and has earned several commendations, including National Defense Ribbon, Meritorious Unit Award, Global War on Terrorism medals and Air Force Training Ribbon. She is currently stationed at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona.
She'll receive a "Hanging with the Heroes" care package delivered with a personalized T-shirt and letters from Round Lake Area Unit District 116 students. Her care package will also include chips, snacks, crackers, candies and personally requested items.
Round Lake Area Exchange Club will present a plaque to Nettleton and her family at 7:30 a.m. Wednesday, Nov. 28, at Panera Bread in Round Lake Beach.
All military personnel serving overseas or in the United States from any of the Round Lake areas, Hainesville, Fox Lake or Ingleside, qualify for the program. If you have a neighbor, family member or someone else in the military, check rlaexchange.org/hero.
