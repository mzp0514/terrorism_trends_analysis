THE United Kingdom on Friday raised its terrorism threat level to its highest point in three years - but the White House doesn't expect to follow suit.
The decision by the Brits to ratchet up the terror threat level to severe, the second highest mark, indicates that an attack is considered "highly likely."
In announcing the alert, British Prime Minister David Cameron warned that Islamic State terrorists pose a "greater and deeper threat" than even the one presented by Osama Bin Laden and his Al Qaeda henchmen.
"What we are facing in Iraq now with (ISIS) is a greater threat to our security than we have seen before," Cameron said in a speech Friday.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said American officials have been in contact with their British counterparts - but "there are no plans to change" the U.S. threat level.
And NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton said the city is facing no specific terror threat.
"The NYPD is following developments in the UK closely and working with the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force to monitor any developments," Bratton said.
"As of now, there is no specific credible threat to New York City. New York City's security posture and NYPD resources are adjusted daily to conform to the changing threat picture around the globe."
