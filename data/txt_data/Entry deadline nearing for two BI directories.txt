Business Insurance will publish two online directories in January. They will be available as searchable databases in the Directories area of www.businessinsurance.com.
Long-Term Care Insurance Providers
The Directory of Long-Term Care Insurance Providers will be published Jan. 23, 2006, in conjunction with a Benefit Management Section on Retiree Benefits and a ranking of the largest long-term care insurance providers. To be listed, companies must provide long-term care insurance to individuals or through employee group plans.
Crisis Management Consultants
The Directory of Crisis Management Consultants will be published Jan. 30, 2006, in conjunction with a Spotlight Report on Terrorism and Crisis Management and the ranking of the largest crisis management consultants.
To be listed, your company must provide services to companies in areas that include potential risks from natural disasters, terrorism and political risk, business interruption, workplace violence or labor shortage, litigation and product tampering or recall.
Companies must provide services on an unbundled basis directly to corporate or institution clients. Companies that provide only media relations are not eligible.
If you would like your company to be listed in one of the upcoming directories, please contact Directory Editor Kevin Edison at kedison@businessinsurance.com to receive a questionnaire. The deadline for inclusion for both directories is Dec. 28.
