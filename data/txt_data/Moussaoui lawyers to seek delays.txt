ALEXANDRIA, Va. - Lawyers for terrorism defendant Zacarias Moussaoui said Monday they plan to seek further delays in bringing the case to trial while they appeal pretrial issues to the Supreme Court.
The lawyers, in a written motion, said they'll ask the trial judge to postpone all proceedings until they've exhausted appeals for Moussaoui - the only U.S. defendant charged with a terrorism conspiracy that included the Sept. 11 attacks.
The lawyers have been trying to gain direct access to three al-Qaida prisoners who might aid Moussaoui's defense and to bar the government from seeking the death penalty.
The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ordered that summaries of interrogation statements of the prisoners be made available to Moussaoui - but not direct access. The court also allowed the government to seek Moussaoui's execution if he's convicted.
The government has requested that opening statements begin in the case on May 31. Moussaoui was indicted in December 2001, charged in part with participating in a broad al-Qaida terrorism conspiracy that included the Sept. 11 attacks.
Moussaoui, who was in custody on immigration violations by September 2001, has acknowledged his loyalty to al-Qaida but said he was never to be part of the airplane hijackings.
