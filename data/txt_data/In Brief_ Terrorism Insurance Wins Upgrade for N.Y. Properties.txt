Moody's Investors Service Inc. said Monday that it had upgraded $1.3 billion of commercial mortgage-backed securities because the owner of two Manhattan properties had obtained terrorism insurance.
The securities are from two separate issues, one backed by the mortgage on 280 Park Ave., the other backed by a pool of loans including the mortgage on the Citigroup Center.
Most of the bonds were upgraded to AAA from Aa1, except for $31 million of bonds from the 280 Park Ave. securitization, for which Moody's raised its ratings to Aa2 from Aa3.
Boston Properties Inc., which owns 280 Park and the Citigroup Center, last month renewed its "all-risk" insurance policy, which now covers "certified acts of terrorism" as defined by the federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. The policy covers all of the company's holdings.
"The increased amount and improved terms for terrorism coverage of the current policy are appropriate for the highest rating levels," Moody's said in a press release.
In September the agency downgraded these bonds and nine other securitizations because the underlying properties lacked adequate terrorism coverage.
Two months later President Bush signed the act, which voided all exclusions in commercial property and casualty insurance policies for terrorism.
