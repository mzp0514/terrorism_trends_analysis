An April 30 Trib news brief about deadly ethnic violence in China stated: "Beijing says China faces an organized terrorist threat from radical Muslim groups in the region." The remarkable aspect of this statement is that China, known historically as a closed society, is willing to use the word "terrorist" and identify the threat as "radical Muslim groups." 
The contrast of Beijing's statement to our government's statements makes one realize how much of our freedom and our rights has been lost in recent years. Our government has eliminated the role of Muslims as related to terrorism. It was the fourth day after the Boston Marathon disaster before it was even called terrorism. Even then, our government has ignored the obvious connections to radical Islam. 
While America is told that the Fort Hood shootings were "workplace violence," the Benghazi incident was caused by a video nobody had even seen and the Boston bombings may have been "lone wolf" events, the Chinese government openly states that it faces a terrorist threat from radical Islam.  
The American people are being denied their right to know and their basic constitutional freedoms as our current government masks, distorts and misrepresents events that concern every American citizen/voter.
