UPDATE @ 2:53 p.m.
 Laith Alebbini has been found guilty of attempting to provide support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization.
 U.S. District Judge Walter Rice stated that the government proved each and every element of the attempted crime.
 Rice also found Alebbini guilty of conspiracy to provide support to a foreign terrorist organization, namely the Islamic State or ISIS.
 Rice said Alebbini's sentencing is scheduled for March 8, 2019.
 EARLIER REPORT:
 The case was the first terrorism trial in the Southern District of Ohio. He was indicted for conspiracy and knowingly attempting "to provide material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organization in the form of personnel to work under ISIS's direction and control."
 Alebbini, 28, who moved to the area in early 2017, was arrested in April 2017 at Cincinnati's airport with airline tickets to the Middle East. He has been in custody since.
