Oil production in Libya by American companies proceeded normally yesterday in the aftermath of the Administration's decision to expel Libya's diplomats from the United States, oil company officials said.
None of the six American oil companies with operations in Libya reported plans to withdraw employees from the country.
US oil company officials report Libyan oil production has remained stable following Administration's decision to expel Libyan diplomats from USLibya is the third-largest foreign supplier of crude oil to the United States, accounting for about 640,000 barrels a day, 10 percent of total oil imports and just over 3.5 percent of total needs, according to the Energy Department.
The American oil companies with operations in Libya are Exxon, Mobil, Occidental, Amerada Hess, Conoco and Marathon. Exxon gets about 100,000 barrels daily of Libyan crude, and has 90 Americans working in Libya, who have about 150 dependents with them. Amerada, Conoco and Marathon have a collective 41 percent interest in the Oasis Oil Company of Libya, which produces 630,000 barrels of crude a day and employs about 100 Americans, who have about 60 dependents.  Libya owns the rest of Oasis.
To emphasize its campaign against international terrorism, the State Department said Wednesday, it was expelling Libya's diplomats and ordering its embassy closed. United States officials said they did not expect the action to affect oil trade between the two countries, and Libyan officials made no mention of the possibility.  Nevertheless, several American officials, who requested anonymity, said President Reagan's decision had been made easier by the current worldwide oil surplus and probably would not have come had there been a scarcity.
