(RTTNews) - Indonesia has assured the Sri Lankan government that it will not allow its territory to be used to promote separatism or terrorism in the island nation amidst apprehensions that Tamil Tiger chief may seek refuge in South-East Asia, reports say.
"Indonesia will not be a launching pad for Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and will not be a party to its arms procurements," Indonesian Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda said while addressing a joint news conference with his Sri Lankan counterpart Rohitha Bogollagama.
Lauding Colombo on its efforts in combating terrorism, the Indonesian minister said both countries have been battered by terrorism and insurgency for decades.
The assurance came amidst apprehensions that LTTE chief Velupillai Prabhakaran may try to seek refuge in South-East Asia or any other country, after the rebels had been confined to a 21 sq km territory in the Island&apos;s north following a series of military set backs in the ongoing offensive by the Sri Lankan army.
Reports indicate that Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia or some European nations could be among the options Prabhakaran may explore to seek refuge.
Meanwhile, the two countries have agreed to sign a defense cooperation deal under which they will share information about terrorist activities and intelligence operations. Bogollagama said the agreement is a vital for the elimination of a group of terrorists with international links.
