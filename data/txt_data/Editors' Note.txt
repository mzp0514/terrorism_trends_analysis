A front-page article and headline on May 21 reported findings from an unreleased Pentagon report about prisoners who have been transferred abroad from the American detention center in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The article said that the Pentagon had found about one in seven of former Guantanamo prisoners had ''returned to terrorism or other militant activity,'' or as the headline put it, had ''rejoined jihad.''
  Those phrases accepted a premise of the report that all the former prisoners had been engaged in terrorism before their detention. Because that premise remains unproved, the day the article appeared in the newspaper, editors changed the headline and the first paragraph on the Times Web site to refer to prisoners the report said had engaged in terrorism or militant activity since their release. 
  The article and headline also conflated two categories of former prisoners. In the Pentagon report, 27 former Guantanamo prisoners were described as having been confirmed as engaging in terrorism, with another 47 suspected of doing so without substantiation. The article should have distinguished between the two categories, to say that about one in 20 of former Guantanamo prisoners described in the Pentagon report were now said to be engaging in terrorism. (The larger share  --  about one in seven  --applies to the total number described in the report as confirmed or suspected of engaging in terrorism.)
