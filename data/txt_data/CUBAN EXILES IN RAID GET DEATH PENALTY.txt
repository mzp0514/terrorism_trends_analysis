HAVANA - A Cuban court sentenced three Cuban exiles from Mi ami to death afterfinding them guilty of terrorism, sabotage and enemy propaganda, the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina reported Saturday.  The three were sentenced after a summary trial Friday in Havana's Provincial Court.
The men are Eduardo Diaz Betancourt, 38; Daniel Candelario Santovenia, 36; and Pedro de la Caridad Alvarez Pedroso, 26. They were captured with arms and explosives Dec. 29 shortly after landing on Cuba's northern coast.  In the seven-hour trial, the prosecutor said the three had confessed to belonging to Cuban exile terrorist groups based in the United States.  In another development Saturday, Cuban police captured the last of five fugitives suspected of killing three policemen in a bungled attempt to flee Cuba by boat, state-run radio reported.  The report said the latest suspect had been arrested in a mountainous region near Bartolome Maso in the eastern province of Granma, more than 500 miles from the boat yard east of Havana where the three policemen were overpowered, tied up and shot dead early Thursday.  Police detained four other suspects Friday near the port of Mariel, west of Havana, after a nationwide manhunt.
