The secretary-general of the League of Arab States, Amre Moussa, and Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim guaranteed yesterday that the summits of the Arab and the Latin American counties, to be held in Brasilia in five weeks, will be "a conference of hope for the future" and a significant historical event. Both stressed the fact that during the past year trade between Brazil and the Arab world increased by 50% and that the increased trade, investments and cooperation among Latin America and the 18 countries, that already have begun forming an Arab Free Trade Zone, will be a natural consequence of the initiative of President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva to promote the summit meeting. 
Asked about the preoccupation of Israel and the United States that the final joint declaration of the conference will include criticisms of the policies of these two countries in relation to the questions of Palestine and terrorism, Moussa and Amorim gave different responses. The secretary-general of the League of Arab States said that the conference "is against no one but in favor of two important regions of the world," but he criticized what he termed "excesses of sensitivity" when discussing the Palestine question. The Brazilian chancellor responded with two sonorous "yeses" to the questions of whether "terrorism" and the "peace processes" would be part of the joint declaration of the summit.
