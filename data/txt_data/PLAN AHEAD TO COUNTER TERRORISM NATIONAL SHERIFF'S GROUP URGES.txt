There isn't any magic bullet to protect communities from terrorism, but sheriffs and deputies can be trained to deal better with bombings and mass shootings.
That was the main message of a seminar held Monday and Tuesday at the Butler Days Inn on preventing and containing attacks by weapons of mass destruction, sponsored by the National Sheriffs' Association.
"We're educated to recognize what's going on nationwide," said Butler County Sheriff Dennis Rickard. "People say it can't happen here, but it has."
The Pittsburgh area and the entire Northeast, with dense populations and interconnected transportation systems, make tempting prey for terrorist organizations, and representatives from the NSA stressed alertness and intelligence gathering in minimizing threats of terrorism.
"They should ask, 'Who are the subversive groups?' and 'What are the potential targets in my community?' " said Ed Willever, an NSA project director who directed Tuesday's training. "It changes a lot from region to region."
The seminar emphasized mental readiness in such situations -- anticipating threats, responding to emergencies and containing outbreaks.
"It's a mental thing," said Willever. "We're trying to teach a thought process."
Instructors also stressed the importance of working with other agencies, including the state police and National Guard.
"We're working on refining existing plans for weapons of mass destruction," said Dan Vogler, executive director of the Sherriffs' Association of Pennsylvania. "I can't stress that enough."
