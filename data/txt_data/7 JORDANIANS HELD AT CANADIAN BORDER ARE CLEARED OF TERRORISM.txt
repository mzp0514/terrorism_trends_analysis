Seven Jordanians were arrested at the Canadian border on what officials Monday called routine illegal immigration charges - not terrorist suspicions, as originally announced.
Three men, two women and two children were taken into custody by U.S. officials Sunday afternoon near the checkpoint at Blaine, Wash.
The crossing was shut down for more than two hours.
One of the women, who was with a toddler and was in Canada legally, had left her car at a duty-free shop on the Canadian side and walked across the border without stopping at a checkpoint, authorities said.
U.S. Border officials picked her up and then found five other people who were waiting to meet her - three men, a woman and a baby, said Sharon Gavin, a spokeswoman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. They were arrested for overstaying their visas, authorities said.
"She was apparently coming over to meet up with her husband," Gavin said. "It now looks like a routine smuggling case and trying to reunite a family."
Hours after the arrests, Constable Archie Alafriz of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police reported that at least one of the men who was arrested "had an affiliation with a known terrorist group."
But the FBI said Monday that authorities had misinterpreted a criminal record in Philadelphia.
"It looks like, in reviewing that record, it is in connection with assault or domestic violence," FBI agent Roberta Burroughs said.
