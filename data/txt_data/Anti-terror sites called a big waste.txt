WASHINGTON - A scathing new report blasts new intelligence hubs created after 9/11 as ineffective and riddled with wasteful spending.
The hubs - called fusion centers - were pushed by the 9/11 commission to "connect the dots" and spot the next terrorist plot before it goes operational.
But the report by Sens. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and Carl Levin (D-Mich.) charges that the centers haven't spotted a single terror plot despite receiving federal aid totaling between $289 million and $1.4 billion. The Department of Homeland Security wasn't able to provide an exact figure.
The centers "forwarded 'intelligence' of uneven quality - oftentimes shoddy . . . and more often than not unrelated to terrorism," the senators wrote.
The report also slams the Arizona and California centers' use of homeland security funds to buy SUVs, flat-screen TVs and spy cameras that can be concealed in shirt buttons and hats.
Other lawmakers, including Sens. Joseph Lieberman (I-Conn.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), who wrote the 2004 law calling for the system, said their colleagues of ignored successes.
Last year, for example, a Massachusetts center helped take down a state resident plotting to fly explosive-laden remote control planes into the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol.
