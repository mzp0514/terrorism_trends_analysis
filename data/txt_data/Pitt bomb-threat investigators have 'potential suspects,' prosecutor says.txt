Investigators have "potential suspects" in the series of bomb threats at the University of Pittsburgh, U.S. Attorney David J. Hickton announced this afternoon. 
Hickton said investigators have made "significant progress" in the case, but provided no details. 
"We thank the University of Pittsburgh students and community members for the information they have provided so far," Hickton said. "The information has helped us to focus upon potential suspects. We encourage anyone who thinks that they may have information to continue sharing this with law enforcement." 
Police have responded to bomb threats targeting more than 50 campus buildings since Feb. 13. The university is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of the person or people responsible for the threats. 
The region's Joint Terrorism Task Force, which includes federal, state and local agencies, is investigating the threats. 
Pitt evacuated five buildings this early this morning in the latest rash of threats. 
The threat was received for Ruskin Hall, Panther Hall, Oakwood Apartments, Center Plaza Apartments and Bouquet Gardens, according to an emergency alert sent at 4 a.m. 
Police cleared all the buildings by 6 a.m., according to follow-up alerts.
