There were fewer international terrorist attacks last year than any other year since 1969, the State Department said Thursday, although it didn't include most of the violence in Iraq.
Though Bush administration officials frequently refer to Iraqi insurgents as terrorists, most attacks in Iraq were not considered international terrorism because they were directed at combatants, the report said.
"Increasingly, the line between insurgency and terrorism has been blurred by anti-coalition attacks that have included suicide car bombings at police stations, an Italian military police base and the headquarters of the International Red Cross," the State Department said in its annual report on terrorism.
The 181-page Patterns of Global Terrorism Report offered a country-by-country review of terrorist attacks and cooperation in fighting terrorism.
In its introduction, the State Department's top counterterrorism official, Cofer Black, cited Saudi Arabia "as an excellent example of a nation increasingly focusing its political will to fight terrorism." The kingdom has frequently been criticized by members of Congress for not doing enough to stop terrorism.
Black said terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia in May and November "served to strengthen Saudi resolve." He also said al-Qaida "is no longer the organization it once was. â€¦ Most of the group's senior leadership is dead or in custody, its membership on the run and its capabilities sharply degraded."
