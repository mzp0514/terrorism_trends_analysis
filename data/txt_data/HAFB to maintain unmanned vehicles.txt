 Hill Air Force Base will be responsible for maintaining key components and systems on the U.S. Air Force's most modern Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, the MQ-1 Predator and the MQ-9 Reaper, members of Utah's congressional delegation announced Wednesday. While there were preliminary reports in March about the work coming to Hill, members of Utah's congressional delegation say Air Force officials have now officially confirmed their decision to award the UAV maintenance work to the Utah base. 
"Having proved their worth in the skies over Iraq and Afghanistan, UAVs have firmly established themselves as the weapon of  the future in our nation's global fight to stamp out terrorism," said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. "The Air Force's decision to make Hill a leader in maintaining this important surveillance and weapons system is a tribute to the base's outstanding depot maintenance program and hardworking and highly skilled work force. It also will result in more quality jobs for Utah and further cement Hill's position as a major player in the U.S. military's mission to protect America." Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah, said, "UAVs are among the most successful weapons in fighting terrorism and I am pleased that such valuable tools are making their way to Hill." Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, said Hill's proximity to the Utah Test and Training Range makes Hill a good choice for the contracts. The base will also do work on the landing gear, brake assemblies and structural components of the RQ-4A Global Hawk, a high-altitude, long-endurance, unmanned reconnaissance aircraft. ?
