Zacarias Moussaoui
Linked to al-Qaeda: Yes
Linked to Sept. 11: Yes
In custody: Awaiting federal trial on terrorism charges in Alexandria, Va. Jury selection will begin in September. A French-Moroccan, he is charged in a six-count indictment with belonging to an al-Qaeda conspiracy to kill Americans and use weapons of mass destruction -- commercial jets. He could face the death penalty if convicted. He was arrested in Minnesota on immigration charges a month before the attacks after acting suspiciously at a flight school. He hasn't been linked directly to the hijackers, but authorities say he followed their game plan: receiving money from al-Qaeda operatives, taking flying lessons, joining a gym, expressing interest in crop-dusting and buying instructional flight-deck videos. Authorities say he received more than $ 50,000 from Yazid Sufaat and Ramzi bin al-Shibh, two operatives who also had contact with the hijackers. He allegedly met with Sufaat in Malaysia in October 2000. The indictment says Moussaoui was trained at an al-Qaeda
camp in Afghanistan. Key questions in his case: whether he was supposed to have taken part in the attacks Sept. 11, was part of some other plot or was a low-level operative who didn't know much about the overall scheme.  He had no apparent contact with hijackers but has been linked to al-Qaeda operatives who assisted them.
Richard Reid
Linked to al-Qaeda: Yes
Linked to Sept. 11: No
In custody: Awaiting federal trial on terrorism charges in Boston. Trial is tentatively scheduled for November. Charged in a nine-count indictment with trying to blow up a jet with explosives hidden in his shoes Dec. 22. Reid, a British citizen, could face life in prison if convicted. He allegedly tried to light a fuse in his sneakers while aboard a Paris-to-Miami flight with nearly 200 passengers. Charges do not say Reid was acting on al-Qaeda's orders, but they call him an al-Qaeda-trained terrorist. A laptop computer used by al-Qaeda officials that was purchased by a reporter in Kabul, Afghanistan, detailed the travels of an al-Qaeda scout; U.S. officials say that person could have been Reid.
John Walker Lindh
Linked to al-Qaeda: Yes
Linked to Sept. 11: No
In custody
Awaiting federal trial on terrorism charges in Alexandria, Va. Jury selection will begin in August. Charged in a 10-count indictment with conspiring to kill U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan and providing material support to the Taliban. He could face life in prison if convicted. Lindh, a Californian, went abroad to study Arabic and Islam and wound up fighting for the Taliban. Court papers say he told FBI agents that he attended two terrorist camps and once met Osama bin Laden. His attorneys say he made the statements under duress and never meant to harm Americans.
Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi
Linked to al-Qaeda: Yes
Linked to Sept. 11: No
In custody: Captured in Afghanistan, he is the most senior al-Qaeda member known to be in U.S. custody. He is a former head of al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan. Bush administration officials say his tip about an al-Qaeda plot to bomb the U.S. Embassy in Yemen led officials to increase security there in mid-January. It's unclear whether he is among the 300 battlefield detainees being held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
Osama Awadallah
Linked to al-Qaeda: No
Linked to Sept. 11: No
Free on $ 500,000 bond: Charged with twice lying to a federal grand jury in New York about his association with hijackers Nawaq Alhamzi and Khalid Al-Midhar. He is a Jordanian who studied at a San Diego college. He says he had nothing to do with the Sept. 11 attacks and accuses U.S. authorities of mistreatment. He could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted.
Nabil Al-Marabh
Linked to al-Qaeda: Yes
Linked to Sept. 11: No
In custody: Charged with immigration violations, he is being held as a witness in the Sept. 11 probe. (Authorities believe he might have information useful to the case.) A former Boston cabdriver who was living in Detroit, he has ties to an associate of bin Laden jailed in Jordan on charges that he planned to blow up a hotel there in 2000.
Germany
Ramzi bin al-Shibh
Linked to al-Qaeda: Yes
Linked to Sept. 11: Yes
Fugitive: Yemeni cleric is believed to have helped plot the Sept. 11 attacks. U.S. officials say bin al-Shibh, operating mostly in Germany, sent thousands of dollars to Moussaoui and several of the 19 hijackers. That connection is crucial for prosecutors trying to portray Moussaoui as part of the al-Qaeda conspiracy that carried out the attacks. Bin al-Shibh is believed to have attended a key planning meeting for the Sept. 11 attacks. The meeting was held in January 2000 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, with hijackers Alhamzi and Al-Midhar, alleged al-Qaeda operative Yazid Sufaat and Riduan Isamuddin, a regional terrorist leader with al-Qaeda ties. A suspect in the October 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen also was at the meeting. Bin al-Shibh was unsuccessful in four attempts to enter the USA, leading authorities to believe he might have been designated as the "20th hijacker." He is one of five suspected terrorists whose videotaped "martyrdom
messages" were found in the rubble of the home of Mohammed Atef, bin Laden's military chief in Afghanistan. Officials say Atef was killed by a U.S. airstrike in November. The videos described suicide attacks on Western interests and led the USA to issue a worldwide terrorism alert Jan. 17. Bin al-Shibh left Germany just before Sept. 11, possibly for Bahrain.
Said Bahaji
Linked to al-Qaeda: Yes
Linked to Sept. 11: Yes
Fugitive: Suspected of arranging apartments, documents and money for the hijackers. Believed to have flown to Pakistan on Sept. 3; authorities say he later went to Bahrain.
Mounir El Motassadeq
Linked to al-Qaeda: Yes
Linked to Sept. 11: Yes
In custody: A student at Hamburg's Technical University, which also was attended by hijacking leader Mohamed Atta. Prosecutors say El Motassadeq had "intensive" contacts with members of the Hamburg terrorist cell that carried out the Sept. 11 attacks. He also had power of attorney over hijacker Marwan Al-Shehhi's bank account, officials say. The account financed Al-Shehhi and other hijackers, including Atta and Ziad Jarrah.
Zakariya Essabar
Linked to al-Qaeda: Yes
Linked to Sept. 11: Yes
Fugitive: Moroccan believed to have helped plot the Sept. 11 attacks. Worshiped at the Al-Quds mosque in Hamburg with hijackers Atta, Al-Shehhi and Jarrah. Left Germany just before Sept. 11.

Linked to Sept. 11: Yes
In custody: Leader of eight men charged with helping the hijackers prepare for the attacks. The group belongs to the Mujahedeen Movement, which has been linked to al-Qaeda. Yarkas' phone number was found in a Hamburg apartment where hijacker Atta once lived. Atta visited Spain twice last year, possibly to plan the attacks, authorities say.

Fugitive: Saudi-born Yemeni national is the leading figure among 17 suspected terrorists mentioned in a nationwide alert the FBI issued Feb. 11. U.S. authorities warned that he and his associates could be planning an attack on Americans in the USA or elsewhere, possibly Yemen. They did not link him to al-Qaeda but said the alert was based on information obtained in Afghanistan and in interviews with al-Qaeda and Taliban detainees in Cuba.
Pakistan
Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh
Linked to al-Qaeda: Yes
Linked to Sept. 11: ?
In custody: British-born militant is the top suspect in the kidnapping and slaying of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, who was abducted in Karachi in January. Pearl was abducted by a group calling itself the National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty. Saeed has ties to Islamic extremist groups and to al-Qaeda. Indian officials suspect him in an attack on the American Center in Calcutta in January. They also believe he might have sent money to hijacker Atta. He has been indicted in the USA on charges of kidnapping an American in India in 1994. He was in an Indian prison on terrorism charges with his mentor, Maulana Masood Azhar, when they were freed in 1999 in exchange for the release of passengers on an Indian Airlines jet that had been hijacked to Kandahar, Afghanistan. U.S. officials are seeking his extradition. Pakistani officials say they want to try him first.
Maulana Masood Azhar
Linked to al-Qaeda: Yes
Linked to Sept. 11: No
In custody: Pakistani was detained in January by President Pervez Musharraf's government. Azhar heads an Islamic militia group that Musharraf banned. Indian investigators have linked Azhar to terrorist acts, and his followers have been linked to the kidnappings and killings of several Americans in India and Pakistan in the past decade. Pakistani authorities say he has been a mentor to Saeed. He was imprisoned in India with Saeed when they were freed in the exchange for the hijacked passengers in 1999. Indian officials say Azhar has ties to al-Qaeda and Pakistan's intelligence agency. Azhar has acknowledged involvement in the 1993 street battle in Mogadishu, Somalia, in which 18 Americans died.

The group is among those waging a "holy war" to establish an Islamic state in the Philippines and Indonesia. Its members are believed to have been involved in initial planning of the Sept. 11 attacks. Believed to have attended the meeting in Kuala Lumpur with alleged al-Qaeda operatives, two Sept. 11 hijackers and a suspect in the bombing of the USS Cole.

Sufaat is believed to have attended the January 2000 meeting of al-Qaeda operatives and Sept. 11 hijackers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Also shown on the map was a utility tunnel under a street next to the embassy. Authorities last week found a freshly dug hole in the tunnel's concrete wall, raising suspicion that an attack was planned soon.

Victor Bout
Linked to al-Qaeda: No
Linked to Sept. 11: No
Fugitive; seen in Moscow last week
Russian arms dealer wanted in Belgium on money-laundering charge. United Nations reports accuse him of illegal arms sales in Africa. U.S. and Belgian officials suspect that Bout, who has been involved in supplying arms to anti-Taliban forces in Afghanistan, such as the Northern Alliance, also might be illegally selling arms to the Taliban and al-Qaeda. Bout denied the allegations in an interview last week with a Moscow radio station. Russian police say there is not enough evidence to charge him. Belgian officials are weighing whether to request his extradition. He has not been linked to al-Qaeda, but U.S. and Belgian officials are investigating whether he had a business relationship with the terrorist network.
