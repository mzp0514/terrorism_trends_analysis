The Federal Government is not adequately prepared to deal with a major disruption of the nation's electrical power systems, the General Accounting Office says.
''While electric power systems are very dependable, they are also highly vulnerable to damage from acts of war, sabotage and terrorism,'' the agency said in a report.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 2 (AP) - The Federal Government is not adequately prepared to deal with a major disruption of the nation's electrical power systems, the General Accounting Office says.
''Should the nation or a region suffer a major, long-term disruption â€¦ the consequences would most likely have national impact,'' said the agency, which is the investigative arm of Congress. ''Neither utilities nor state-local governments can reasonably be expected to effectively manage such situations.''
In previous studies, the agency said that Federal plans for managing electrical emergencies arising from war, sabotage or terrorism were ''inadequate or nonexistent.'' The new reportsaid that the Department of Energy ''has not developed nor has plans to develop national-regional electrical power contingency plans.''
''The implications of this report are truly disturbing,'' said Representative Berkley Bedell, Democrat of Iowa, chairman of the House Small Business Energy Subcommittee.
''I do not understand how the administration can spend so much time and money making plans to evacuate our cities in case of nuclear war, and then ignore the very real possibility that simple acts of sabotage or terrorism could shut down our electric power system and bring our society to its knees.''
