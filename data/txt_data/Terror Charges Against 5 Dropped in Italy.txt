An Italian judge was sharply criticized Tuesday after she dismissed terrorism charges against five North Africans accused of being Islamic militants. 
 The judge, Clementina Forleo, ruled Monday evening in Milan that the evidence against three Tunisians and two Moroccans arrested on charges of recruiting suicide bombers and supplying support to Islamic terror organizations for operations in Iraq constituted wartime ''guerrilla'' activities, not terrorism.
 ''Historically, the activity of the cells in question coincided with the United States attack on Iraq,'' said a statement explaining the decision, which was confirmed by Armando Spataro, the Milan prosecutor who is appealing the case. 
 The five men, still detained on lesser charges of trading in forged documents, were arrested in 2003 and 2004 under tough antiterrorism laws introduced after the Sept. 11 attacks. The judge ruled that guerrilla warfare did not fall under the laws. 
 Foreign Minister Gianfranco Fini said he was ''enraged'' by the ruling.
 Mr. Spataro said Tuesday evening that he respected the decision, but strongly disagreed with Ms. Forleo's criteria for determining terrorism. 
 Italian investigators say one of the suspects, Mohamed Daki, a Moroccan, had connections to the terrorist cell responsible for planning the Sept. 11 attacks.
