As members of an ultra-Orthodox Jewish group buried a teen-ager who was killed in a shooting on the Brooklyn Bridge, his family said his killer should face the death penalty for terrorism.
Amid heavy police security, thousands gathered Sunday outside the Brooklyn headquarters of the Lubavitcher Hasidic sect for a funeral that mixed Old World tradition with modern media savvy.
Gov. Mario Cuomo, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and other politicians turned out for the funeral of Aaron Halberstam, 16. He died Saturday, four days after being shot in the head while riding in a van with 14 other young rabbinical students.
Lebanese-born taxi driver Rashad Baz, 28, was charged in the shooting that wounded three others. Hlal Mohammad, 32, and Bassam Reyati, 27, both Jordanians living in Brooklyn, were charged with hindering prosecution and weapons possession by helping Baz dispose of the guns and the car. Police said Baz may be charged with murder.
The attack came four days after a Jewish settler from Brooklyn massacred at least 30 Muslims at a mosque on the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Even though authorities say they've found no link to terrorism, Halberstam's parents urged the U.S. Justice Department to charge Baz with terrorism under a federal law that calls for the death penalty. New York has no death penalty.
"There must be consequences for this untimely and brutal murder so that a clear message is sent - that wanton violence and anarchy will not be tolerated on American soil," Chesed and Devora Halberstam said.
