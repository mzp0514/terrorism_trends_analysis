Syrian President Hafez Assad and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher met for four hours Saturday to try to break a deadlock in Syrian peace talks with Israel.
Christopher later returned to his hotel but refused to comment to reporters on the discussions in Damascus.
A U.S. official said Christopher and Assad may meet again Sunday to discuss Israeli proposals that Christopher brought to try to revive negotiations between Syria and Israel.
Talks between the two countries have been stalled over the Golan Heights, seized by Israel from Syria during the 1967 Arab-Israel war, and the state of future relations.
Syrian presidential spokesman Joubran Kourieh said Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa held separate talks with Christopher and later attended the meeting with Assad.
Christopher brought new Israeli proposals.
The Israeli government gave Christopher the proposals in the past two days, and U.S. officials said he would present them to the Syrian leader.
Syria's foreign minister and Christopher discussed terrorism, human rights, drug trafficking, counterfeiting and other issues, a senior U.S. official said. The two governments are trying to handle these issues in a more formal way after President Bill Clinton and Assad agreed to do so at a meeting in Geneva Jan. 16.
