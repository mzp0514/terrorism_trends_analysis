WASHINGTON - The House overwhelmingly approved an anti-terrorism bill yesterday that gives the Justice Department broad new powers for expanded surveillance, intelligence-sharing and detention of suspects.
Weeks of negotiations led to tweaks in the bill, pushed by Attorney General John Ashcroft, and produced a measure that cleared the House in a 357-to-66 vote.
It was expected to overcome relatively minor objections in the Senate and land on President Bush's desk by tomorrow.
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) called it "a good bill" and predicted "a pretty overwhelming" vote.
House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) said the measure would get rid of "bureaucratic legal hurdles" that plague some federal probes.
The bill would:
* Increase from 48 hours to seven days the time the feds can detain certain noncitizens;
* Allow investigators to obtain a subject's E-mails and track calls on all of his or her phone numbers - rather than requiring separate warrants for each;
* Boost the Treasury Department's powers to investigate terrorist money laundering;
* Impose tough penalties for people or groups that harbor terrorists.
A key compromise was getting the White House to accept a provision requiring reauthorization in four years.
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Pat Leahy (D-Vt.) said Democrats "did the White House a favor" by forcing other changes that they maintained would ensure the bill is constitutional - although civil libertarians said they are still concerned about it.
