The editorial ''Confidence in the CIA,'' Nov. 3: observes
accurately that with the end of the cold war the complexity of
international relations and security requires intelligence services
in which the American people have confidence. These intelligence
services must also possess competence.
The challenge of a diverse, expanding array of national security
issues - nuclear proliferation, international terrorism, economic
espionage, and ethnic conflict, among others - has begun to strain
the capabilities of the ossified bureaucracies of US intelligence.
Without a complete restructuring of intelligence services
designed to address the proliferation of these new challenges to
global security, the US will be ill prepared to help ensure
stability and peace in the 21st century.
It is urgent for Congress to review and revise the National
Security Act of 1947 and to create an innovative, effective
organizational structure for our intelligence services.
W.F. Dunkelberger, Randolph, Vt.
