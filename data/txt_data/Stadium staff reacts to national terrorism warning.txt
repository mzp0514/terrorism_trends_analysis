Cmdr. Pat Cunningham of VUPD said the security of Vanderbilt'sfootball stadium, Dudley Field, is constantly being reassessed withthe state homeland security department, Vanderbilt Athletics andPlant Operations. Cunningham said the stadium staff has a higherlevel of awareness, and are educated about what to report and towhom, should they suspect something.
"We make sure that all the stadium personel, from the ushers tothe venders are aware of the increased security concerns,"Cunningham said.
Some security jobs like checking bags are more visible tovisitors, but other less visible security actions are done in aregular meeting before every home game. In these meetings they takeinto account things like terrorism warnings or that is homecomingweekend - factors that increase planning on their part, but aren'tvisible to stadium visitors.
