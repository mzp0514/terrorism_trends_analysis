Regarding the column "A growing Middle East mess" (Nov. 22 and TribLIVE.com): Condoleezza Rice's argument cites a breakdown of the Middle East due to sectarian violence, weak alliances and terrorism as reason for America to act. I disagree with her thesis, as the noted reasons are why the United States should not get involved in the situation. 
To involve the United States in this quagmire would be extremely dangerous for our country. We now spend more than we take in, our debt has risen above $16 trillion, we are in an economic depression and our country is speeding toward a "fiscal cliff," among other concerns. We cannot afford to get involved in other people's affairs because doing so would drag us into a deeper crisis. 
Keep in mind that many of these countries are in this situation because of our intervention. Iran hates us because we overthrew its democratically elected leader in 1953. We went into Iraq on unjustifiable grounds in 2003 and tried to unfairly democratize the Iraqis, and we could have ended our intervention in Afghanistan in 2001 when we had the Taliban cornered at Tora Bora, but we stayed there longer than needed. 
Let us focus more on the problems within our own borders, rather than worrying about the problems within foreign borders.
