As a longtime elected official, it’s not the first time Hobbs has received threats, but the volume and intensity are off the charts this year. She attributed the invigorated hate to the president and his supporters’ rhetoric and to a handful of right wing provocateurs who shared two 2017 tweets in which she, as the Senate minority leader, said the president “is on the side of freaking Nazis” and that Trump has made it clear “he’s more interested in pandering to his neo-nazi base than being @POTUS for all Americans. ” Local Republicans resurfaced the tweets late last week (LINK) and conservative news sites like Washington Examiner picked up the story (LINK) while far right provocateurs like Dinesh D’Souza and James woods amplified it. 
Hobbs stood by the tweet, while attempting to put it in the proper context that there were, in fact, neo-Nazis at the Charlottesville “Unite the Right” rally (LINK), where a white supremacist committed domestic terrorism by ramming his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing one and injuring 19 (LINK). Trump famously declared there were “very fine people on both sides” of that event, prompting Hobbs’ tweets in the following days. “I’m not trying to hide from my previous record  if I was, I would have gone back and deleted the tweet,” she said, adding that the attack wasn’t aimed at all conservatives or all of the president’s supporters, but at the “small part of his base, which we all know is there, and which we all know he continues to not denounce but tells to stand by. ” But the tweets don’t compromise her ability to be an election official, she said, adding that since becoming secretary of state, she has repeatedly bitten her tongue on partisan issues, which is more than some of her predecessors, such as Ken Bennett, who had to apologize for flirting with the “birther” movement in 2012 (LINK).
