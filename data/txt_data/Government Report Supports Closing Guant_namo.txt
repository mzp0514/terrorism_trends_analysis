WASHINGTON (AP) -- The prison at Guant치namo Bay, Cuba, could be closed and the 166 detainees being held there could be absorbed safely by prisons in the United States, a government report says.
Many of the detainees are accused of plotting terrorist acts against the United States.
''This report demonstrates that if the political will exists, we could finally close Guant치namo without imperiling our national security,'' said Senator Dianne Feinstein, the Senate Intelligence Committee chairwoman, who released the Government Accountability Office study on Wednesday.
The study shows that 373 prisoners convicted of terrorism are already held in 98 prisons across the country.
''As far as I know, there hasn't been a single security problem reported in any of these cases,'' said Ms. Feinstein, Democrat of California, who commissioned the study in 2008. ''This fact outweighs not only the high cost of maintaining Guant치namo -- which costs more than $114 million a year -- but also provides the same degree of security without the criticism of operating a military prison in an isolated location.''
The study said that six Defense Department prisons and 98 Justice Department prisons could take the detainees, but that they probably would need to be modified and that some inmates might need to be relocated.
