I just returned from a visit to Israel with my wife. We talked to many Israelis and were near the recent bus bombing when it happened.
I can clearly say that letter writer Robert G. Hazo is off base with his assessment of the underlying cause of the Israel-Palestinian problem ("Lacking a Statesman," Sept. 3).
 Israelis want and need peace and security. The problem is Muslim terrorists whose publicly stated goal and actions are the elimination of Israel. Blowing up a bus full of women and children is a criminal act that is against international law and religious law, including the Koran. These Muslim criminals are willing to sacrifice the Palestinian people and the needs of the Palestinian people for their own goals. Their teaching hatred of Jews and infidels has no relationship to helping the Palestinian people. This is the crowd that cheered after 9/11.
 What Mr. Hazo left out is that Israel has both peace treaties and peace with its neighbors Jordan and Egypt. Israel gave back to Egypt all the land it won in a war started by Jordan and Egypt in exchange for peace. These neighbors would be elated if the extremist Palestinian element were gone.
 The Palestinian people have rights and Israel has rights. We have to separate these rights from the method used to attain the rights. Israel offered the Palestinian Authority a state under more than fair terms and the offer was rejected by Yasser Arafat and answered by terrorism. Giving in to terrorism encourages terrorism: The only answer to terrorism is its defeat.
