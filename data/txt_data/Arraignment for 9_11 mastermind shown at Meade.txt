FORT MEADE - A firefighter, lawyers and members of the military were among those who spent Saturday at Fort George G. Meade watching on closed-circuit television the arraignment of the self-proclaimed mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks.
About 80 spectators watched the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, hearing from Fort Meade, though that number dwindled as the hearing stretched into the evening. The hearing was particularly long because Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four co-defendants being tried on murder and terrorism charges protested the hearing by refusing to listen to simultaneous Arabic translations of the proceedings through headphones. That prompted translators to speak aloud, giving Arabic translations following every statement in English.
John Mackleer, a longtime Philadelphia firefighter, took the day off to watch the proceedings at Fort Meade's movie theater. The 68-year-old said he didn't know any firefighters killed on 9/11, but he knew people who helped with the cleanup.
The hearing was also shown at installations in New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts for victims' families. Fort Meade was the only site open to the public.
Ten family members also watched from Fort Meade, though they were separated from other spectators by a series of screens.
