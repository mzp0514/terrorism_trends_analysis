President Bush asked Congress on Thursday for an additional $$ @27.1 billion for the war against terrorism and the recovery from September's attacks. 
More than half the money - $$ @14 billion - would go to the Defense Department and intelligence agencies, mostly for their costs in pursuing terrorists overseas. 
"I know it's a lot of money â€¦ but we fight for freedom," the president said in El Paso, Texas, before beginning a trip to Latin America.
"The price of freedom is never too high as far as I'm concerned," he said.
Bush's request had been expected since December, when Congress finished approving $$ @40 billion meant as a first response to the Sept. 11 attacks. 
Thursday's package seems likely to be popular on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers overwhelmingly have supported the effort against terrorism. Even so, some Democrats have pressed the administration for more details about its war plans in recent weeks, and the bill's components could be rearranged and money added.
Other parts of Bush's request include:
* $$ @4.7 billion for the new Transportation Security Administration to bolster safety measures at airports and aboard planes, and for the Coast Guard. 
* $$ @1.2 billion for foreign aid aimed at thwarting terrorists abroad. 
* Nearly $$ @5.6 billion to help New York, where the twin towers of the World Trade Center were destroyed. This is part of the $$ @21 billion in aid to New York that Bush promised this week. 
* $$ @327 million for equipment and training for local law enforcement agencies.
