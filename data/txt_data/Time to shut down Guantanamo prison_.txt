President Obama has renewed efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center. Five more prisoners were released last week.
Some people say these detainees will return to fighting the United States.  But that assumes they believe the word of bounty hunters who were paid for each person they turned in. Now there's an impartial source of information.
I don't deny some of the people released have turned to terrorism. That is to be expected. Locking people up for decades is a great way of creating terrorists. If they had faced trial for the charges, they might have been reasonably locked up indefinitely.
Dave Cawdell
We debate too much about trials and convictions for a war enemy.  If these released prisoners turn back to terrorism, we should bomb them. That would be a lot cheaper in the long run. Make sure these guys are tracked.
Charles Bates
Resettling detainees from Guantanamo as refugees in neutral countries makes a lot of sense. A new start is what they really need in order not to turn to terrorism.
Annette Keller
If I were a prisoner held for  years and was never charged, I assure you once released, I would be seeking retribution. What a nightmare this all has been. While I am 100% about protecting American interests, this was just plain wrong on a human rights level.
Shawn Key
It is just a matter of time before the released prisoners join one of the terrorist groups to fight again. Does anyone really doubt that? Given the mind-set of these fighters, how could it be any other way?
Fran Trantham
At some point, you have to let prisoners of war go. When wars end, you free them.  What's more, a long protracted war is a fool's errand.
