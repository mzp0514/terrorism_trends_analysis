One of Elmhurst's top police administrators soon will become the person Naperville turns to in a crisis.  
Elmhurst Deputy Police Chief Peter Smith will start Jan. 5 as Naperville's emergency preparedness manager, officials announced Wednesday.  
Smith has spent three decades in law enforcement and has worked with a number of terrorism watchdog groups.  
He has been anti-terrorism committee chairman for the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police and a member of the Illinois Terrorism Task Force and U.S. Department of Justice's Anti- Terrorism Task Force in Chicago.  
As emergency preparedness manager, Smith will work with city, county and state agencies and individuals to ensure Naperville is ready for a disaster or act of terrorism.  
His annual salary will be $70,000 and he will report to City Manager Peter Burchard.  
"Peter Smith will be responsible for carrying the organization's values and vision into our emergency preparedness program," Burchard said.  
"He has almost 35 years of public safety experience, including virtually every supervisory position."  
As deputy chief in Elmhurst, Smith headed the operations division where he supervised the budget and 80 percent of the force's employees.  
"I couldn't be happier," he said of his new position. "In working with the city manager, we envision an expanded role in how the city plans, responds and recovers from natural and man-made emergencies."  
Smith has a bachelor's degree in criminal justice management from Aurora University. He is married with two children.
