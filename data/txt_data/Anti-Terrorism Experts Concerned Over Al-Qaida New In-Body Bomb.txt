(RTTNews) - Anti-terrorism experts have expressed concern after reports said that Al-Qaida has developed new explosive devices that enable suicide-bombers to carry them hidden in their intestine to breach airline security measures.
According to a report in the The Sunday Telegraph an Al-Qaida militant passed through several airline security checks with a bomb hidden in his intestine last month and made an abortive bid to assassinate a prominent Saudi prince.
Addressing the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, Richard Barrett, head of the United Nations&apos; Al-Qaida and Taliban monitoring group said the Al-Qaida "hasn&apos;t really made a connection to a new generation" of young Muslims but the organization&apos;s use of a well-known drug smuggling technique already had breached airline security.
Even though Al-Qaida&apos;s capability is reduced, Barrett said the organization&apos;s power to sow terror was far from eliminated and that it is clear that the terrorist outfit remains determined enough and inventive enough to cause another terrorist spectacular.
"While not wanting to be alarmist, I admit this is alarming," Barrett was quoted as saying.
Scott Stewart, a terrorism expert for Stratfor, a global intelligence company, warned that depending on how old metal detectors at airports were and how they were calibrated, these devices were vulnerable.
