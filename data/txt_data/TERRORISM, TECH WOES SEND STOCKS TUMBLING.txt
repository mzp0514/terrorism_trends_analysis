New worries about terrorism and another disappointing tech outlook sent stocks falling sharply for a second straight session yesterday, with technology stocks and the Nasdaq composite index bearing the brunt of the selling.
 Wall Street's concerns about terrorism resurfaced with the broadcast of a videotape purportedly of Osama bin Laden; the broadcast, on the Arabic satellite channel Al-Jazeera, came one day before the second anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.
 Meanwhile, Texas Instruments Inc. narrowed its third-quarter revenue estimate, cutting a penny off the high end, just a day after a disappointing revenue outlook from Nokia Corp. prompted investors to turn cautious and lock in some gains from the market's recent advance. Still, Wall Street had room to pull back after seeing its major stock gauges climb for four weeks running.
"The market was ripe for a sell-off. Obviously, Texas Instruments is helping that sell-off to accelerate," said Peter Cardillo, president and chief strategist of Global Partner Securities Inc. "But I don't think it is the beginning of a significant pullback. I just think it is a little drop here."
 The tech-dominated Nasdaq closed down 49.62, or 2.7 percent, at 1,823.81. The last time the Nasdaq had a bigger one-day loss was nearly two months ago, July 17 when it forfeited 49.95, or 2.9 percent.
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 86.74, or 0.9 percent, to 9,420.46. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 12.25, or 1.2 percent, to 1,010.92.
 In the bond market, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 27/32 point, or $6.88 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 4.27 percent from 4.36 percent late Tuesday.
 The 30-year Treasury bond added 1 1/32point to yield 5.16 percent, down from 5.23 percent, a day earlier, according to Moneyline Telerate.
 In other trading, the benchmark 2-year note rose 3/32 point to yield 1.63 percent, down from 1.68 percent Tuesday. Intermediate maturities rose between 7/32 point and 21/32 point.
 Disappointing high-tech earnings forecasts contributed to yesterday's decline in the stock market.
 Texas Instruments fell $1.90 to $23.42 after shaving a penny off the high end and low end of its third-quarter earnings estimate. Nokia, meanwhile, fell 59 cents to $15.39 the day after its downbeat revenue outlook inspired investors to collect some profits. Yesterday UBS Warburg cut its rating on the cell phone maker to "neutral" from "buy."
 The market "has had such a strong run that [stocks] are pulling back. It really did start with Nokia," said Peter Dunay, chief market strategist at Wall Street Access, a New York-based brokerage firm.
 National City Corp. fell $1.51 to $30.30 after the bank holding company said its 2003 earnings would miss analysts' expectations, due in part to a drop-off in mortgage refinancing in the face of rising interest rates.
 Brokerage house downgrades pulled other stocks lower. Micron Technology Inc. dropped $1.35 to $13.35 after Soundview Technology lowered its rating on the semiconductor maker to "neutral" from "outperform."
 Juniper Networks Inc. declined 94 cents to $16.55 after Smith Barney downgraded it to "in-line" from "outperform."
 Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 5 to 2 on the New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume totaled 2.03 billion shares vs. 1.88 billion on Tuesday.
 The Russell 2000 index fell 11.81, or 2.3 percent, to 501.76.
