A car bomb that police suspect was planted by Islamic terrorists blasted the Israeli Embassy in London on Tuesday, injuring 14 people.
Early today, five more people were hurt when a car bomb exploded in north London. The second explosion occurred outside a building that houses Israeli and Jewish organizations, including the Joint Israel Appeal, a charity fund-raising organization that supports causes in Israel and in the Jewish community in Britain.
In the embassy bombing, police were hunting for a well-dressed, middle-aged woman of Mediterranean appearance, who parked a gray Audi - with what turned out to be fake license plates - and walked away seconds before 20 to 30 pounds of high explosive packed in the trunk exploded.
"Given the appearance of the woman and the location of the Israeli Embassy, this seems to be a return of Middle Eastern terrorism to the streets of London," said Cmdr. David Tucker, head of Scotland Yard's Anti-Terrorist branch.
The bomb exploded without warning outside the embassy in the fashionable Kensington district of west London. Windows were shattered in nearby Kensington Palace. Princess Margaret, the duke and duchess of Gloucester, and Prince Michael of Kent were in the palace but were not hurt. Diana, princess of Wales, who also lives at the palace, was away on a holiday.
Rachel Gordon, who works in the embassy's press office, said: "It was such a huge, huge explosion. Parts of the building just collapsed."
The blast destroyed a two-story brick annex between the embassy and the consulate, collapsing its roof and blowing out a section of its walls. One floor collapsed in the apartment building nearest the explosion, police said. Windows were blown out of a high-rise across the street.
Charing Cross Hospital said one of the 14 injured people treated there was in serious condition. An unknown number of people were treated at the scene. The injured suffered smoke inhalation, shock and cuts from shrapnel and glass.
Cmdr. Tucker said the woman who parked the Audi was between 55 and 60 and carried a shopping bag from Harrod's department store. She had aroused the suspicion of a policeman and an Israeli security guard, who were checking out the car when the bomb went off. Although they were only a few feet away from the car when the bomb detonated, neither was seriously injured.
Tucker said the two officers approached the woman, but it was not clear whether they challenged her. Both officers suffered shock from the explosion and were not able to give full accounts in the first hours after the blast. "She may well have been spoken to," Tucker said. "She clearly did something to arouse suspicion."
Tucker confirmed that authorities had recently met with representatives of the Board of Jewish Deputies, who had called for parking to be banned outside certain facilities, including the embassy.
"We did have discussions along those lines a week ago . . . and on balance the decision was made that parking restrictions were not the answer," Tucker said. RABIN POINTS TO IRAN
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, in Washington for Israel's declaration of peace with Jordan, called on the world to fight what he termed an Iranian-backed terrorism.
As Rabin and Jordan's King Hussein declared peace on Monday, Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim units attacked Israeli forces in southern Lebanon, killing an officer and wounding 13 other soldiers.
Other attacks include last week's car bombing in Buenos Aires, in which 96 people were killed, a bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires in 1992, when 30 people were killed, and the bombing of a private plane in Panama last week in which 21 people were killed.
