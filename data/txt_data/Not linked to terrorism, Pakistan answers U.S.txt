ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Pakistan denied U.S. charges Monday that it was linked to terrorism and brushed aside Washington's requests for help in getting terrorism suspect Osama bin Laden expelled from his Afghan sanctuary.
A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the charges, contained in the annual U.S. report on terrorism, which was leaked to the New York Times over the weekend, were without foundation.
"Pakistan is irrevocably opposed to terrorism in all its forms. Pakistan has always cooperated with the international community, including the United States, to combat terrorism."
It was Islamabad's first reaction to the State Department report, which the New York Times said named South Asia for the first time as being a major source of terrorism.
It said the report accused Pakistan of failing to end its support for groups that trained "terrorists" in Afghanistan and in Pakistan itself and had declined to close "certain Pakistani schools that serve as conduits for terrorism."
This was a reference to Muslim militants battling India rule of Kashmir. India says they are terrorists, while Pakistan says they are "freedom fighters" taking part in a popular uprising.
A Foreign Ministry spokesman dismissed U.S. demands that the Islamabad government use its key influence with the ruling Islamic Taliban movement in Afghanistan to get bin Laden, a Saudi-born national, extradited.
Pakistan, one of only three countries that recognize the movement as a government since it came to power in 1996, says Washington must deal directly with the Taliban over bin Laden.
