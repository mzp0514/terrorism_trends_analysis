The army's Fifth Brigade, which was trained by North Koreans, is believed to have been withdrawn from troubled Matabeleland Province, Western diplomatic sources said today.

HARARE, Zimbabwe, July 30 (Reuters) - The army's Fifth Brigade, which was trained by North Koreans, is believed to have been withdrawn from troubled Matabeleland Province, Western diplomatic sources said today.Government spokesmen could not be reached for comment.
The brigade, a counterinsurgency unit, went into the province in January to crush rebels said by officials to be fighting to replace the Government with one led by Joshua Nkomo, the opposition leader who went into exile in Britain in March, saying his life was in danger. Mr. Nkomo's support is concentrated in the province.
Mr. Nkomo and his Zimbabwe African People's Union party have denied involvement in insurgent activities. Independent church and welfare organizations and Mr. Nkomo's party have accused the Fifth Brigade of terrorism throughout Matabeleland, killing and maiming hundreds of civilians.
Other informants, including churchworkers and white Members of Parliament, have said trouble is increasing again in Matabeleland.
