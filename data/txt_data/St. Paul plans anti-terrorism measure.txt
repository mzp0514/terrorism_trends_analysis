RSEC:             St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman Wednesday announced additional plans to ensure St. Paul is prepared to combat terrorist attacks similar to those on Sept. 11 on the East Coast.
   Coleman, knowing the City Council's desire to bring the Police Department up to full strength, instructed Police Chief William Finney to schedule a police academy to hire new recruits. The department is down to 556 officers, 22 under its authorized strength of 578.
     An academy scheduled for later this fall was canceled two weeks ago because the department didn't have enough money to hire 22 officers, Police Department spokesman Michael Jordan said.
     Deputy Mayor Susan Kimberly, delivering Coleman's letter to the City Council on Wednesday, said the mayor is committed to providing the money needed to hire the additional officers. "We'll have to figure out what it takes to do that," Kimberly said.
     Coleman also requested Fire Chief Tim Fuller to submit a report within 10 days that assesses the city's preparedness against terroristic and biochemical threats. A consultant is examining security in the city.
     "We're just trying to make the courthouse as safe and prepared as reasonable," Kimberly said.
