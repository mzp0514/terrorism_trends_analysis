It's still a buyer's market for property insurance.
Rates continue to decrease, albeit not quite as steeply compared to this time in 2004 as they had between midyear 2003 and midyear 2004. Capacity for most risks remains adequate.
But questions surrounding the availability of terrorism insurance this time next year are beginning to have their impact on the market. While terrorism coverage remains relatively inexpensive despite the U.S. Congress' failure to reauthorize the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, insurers have begun inserting terrorism sunset clauses in property policies that extend beyond TRIA's Dec. 31 expiration date.
TRIA's long-term outlook became even hazier last week when the Treasury Department recommended that the act not be extended in its current form. Treasury left open the possibility that the administration could accept a significantly scaled back program (see story, page 1).
Still, buyers right now have a good deal with which to be pleased.
``The property market, in general, is competitive. There are a lot of players, and, certainly, we are in a soft-market phase,'' said Tim Rose, president of Liberty Mutual Property in Weston, Mass. ``I don't think there's that big of a difference between January and June and July,'' he said. ``As far as rates go, we're in the high single-digit to lower double-digit rate decreases. For larger accounts, they are averaging a little more than that, and medium-sized accounts a little less.''
``So far this year, our average account has probably been turning over with premium reductions of between 5% and 10%. But averages don't always tell the full story,'' said Randy Schreitmueller, vp at Johnston, R.I.-based Factory Mutual Insurance Co., which does business as FM Global. ``Clients who really went the extra mile to improve their facilities would be at the high end of the spectrum.''
There has been no wholesale movement of accounts, Mr. Schreitmueller said.
``In general, at least client retention is holding up very well. In batting-average terms, we're still probably in the mid- to high .900s,'' he said. ``All things considered, I don't think we're seeing a lot of business changing hands,'' Mr. Schreitmueller said. It's ``more of a struggle'' to get new business, he said, because insurers are defending their accounts.
``Honestly, I think there is a lot more downward pressure. I don't think there's any more competition; the market's competitive whether it's in the up or down cycle,'' said Mike Petruzzello, senior vp and chief underwriting officer of Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection & Insurance Co. in Hartford, Conn.
``In many cases, there becomes a mindset that the market is softening'' and brokers are expected to come back with lower quotes on renewal, Mr. Petruzzello said. ``I think it's softening; I wouldn't say it's soft. It's not unbearable.''
``The rate of decrease is less than it was a year ago,'' noted Gail Norstrom, managing director-property practice group for Aon Risk Services in Avon, Conn. ``In round numbers, we're probably looking at 10%. It's all over the lot, though-about a third of our customers are getting decreases of 10% to 25% and probably a like amount having as-is renewals,'' he said. Mr. Norstrom said that although in ``a very few cases,'' clients are facing increases, ``the general trends are still favorable to the policyholders.''
``We found it as a continuation of an improved marketplace,'' said Bradley R. Wood, senior vp-risk management for Marriott International in Bethesda, Md. ``Premiums, on average, decreased 15% to 20% but varied considerably among the perils. We saw a much larger decrease on terrorism insurance; wind-exposed locations saw no decrease or were virtually flat,'' said Mr. Wood, whose property program renewed in April.
``We saw sunset clauses on a significant share of our program, which underscores the importance of the reauthorization of TRIA,'' he said.
``We had another good property year,'' said Steven La Shier, deputy director-risk management for the Los Angeles Unified School District. ``We saw rate reductions across the board on most items.''
The district's excess property rate went down 5%, its earthquake policy on its 29-story headquarters building went down 10%, and its boiler and machinery rate decreased 12%, Mr. La Shier said.
It's the second year in a row for rate decreases at the district, which retains the first $500,000 on each property claim. ``Everything went up from 9/11 until July of last year,'' Mr. La Shier said. ``I had even bigger decreases last year, but this year I unfortunately had 8% to 14% property value increases.''
``I have $8 billion worth of property, so when you raise property up 8%, even though rates went down 5%, my net premium was an increase,'' Mr. La Shier said. He noted, though, that ``if I had the old rates from last year, I would have paid an extra $232,000 in premium'' rather than just the $40,000 extra the district paid on its most recent property renewal.
``Not only have the rates come down, but a few of the bells and whistles are coming back that we lost in the late '90s and, obviously, post Sept. 11,'' Mr. La Shier said. ``I got enhanced limits, I got enhanced coverages and I got rate reductions at the same time.''
Despite four hurricanes hitting Florida last year, Mike Benishek, risk manager for the Palmetto, Fla.-based Pacific Tomato Growers, said he doesn't expect ``anything shocking'' when he renews his property coverage on Aug. 31. The Tomato Growers' property coverage is part of a commercial package policy.
In fact, after receiving a rate decrease on the property portion of the package policy last year, Mr. Benishek said he anticipates even softer rates this year.
Current market conditions should not change soon absent negative external developments, said Liberty Mutual's Mr. Rose.
``It will remain competitive through the rest of this year,'' he predicted. ``When it will end, I'm not sure. There are certain events that could influence the insurance cycle. Certainly, one manmade or natural catastrophe...would have an impact on the cycle, maybe bringing it to an end.''
Mr. Rose noted that, similarly, a significant improvement in the investment climate could extend the length of the current cycle
Whether current market conditions persist will depend on insurer' results, said Aon's Mr. Norstrom. He noted that deductibles are still high, but a major earthquake or another active windstorm season could turn the market.
Still, the rate decreases won't last forever, said Bob Howe, director-global property placement for Marsh Inc. in New York. ``Accounts that have had major reductions may see some pushback from underwriters. Underwriters are getting close to that line where they're looking closely at rates and how the rates stand up to where they think they're appropriate. We've seen some underwriters walk away from business,'' he said.
``Clients need to be very conscious of the compounding effect of these multiyear reductions,'' he said.
Mr. Howe said some rate decreases might be misleading because of an escalation in replacement values used by some underwriters. Higher costs for construction materials such as steel and cement have caused some underwriters to increase replacement values to the point where they significantly reduce the rate cuts, he said.
TRIA's hazy future, if it has any future at all, is definitely having an impact, said Alexandra Glickman, manager director and practice leader of Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.'s Gallagher Real Estate & Hospitality Services unit in Glendale, Calif.
``This is a schizophrenic market. We're seeing rate decreases, including catastrophic perils, in the 15%-plus range. At the same time, the threat of TRIA not being extended is limiting a lot of carriers from providing capacity to the commercial real estate and finance industries,'' Ms. Glickman said.
``Until Treasury and Congress gets this sorted out, my concern are clients are going to be paying ridiculous premiums for stand-alone coverage that they may not need if, in fact, (TRIA is) extended,'' she said.
``I think you're beginning to see in the industry conditional extensions'' for terrorism coverage on property policies, said Liberty Mutual's Mr. Rose. ``We'll see some withdrawal of capacity, and some carriers have said, beyond the Dec. 31 date, they will not provide the cover. I think very shortly the pressure will build, depending on what Treasury decides.''
``It's a very real and very big issue for property carriers and for the insurance industry,'' Mr. Rose said. ``There's a lot of interest in the industry to see it extended, and, if it's not, then there will be a reaction, from an underwriting standpoint, as to pricing and capacity.''
``If TRIA is not reauthorized, we're going to have a pretty difficult situation,'' said Mr. Norstrom, adding that almost 60% of Aon's customers purchase terrorism coverage.
``Absent TRIA, terrorism coverage will be very scarce and very expensive,'' he said.
