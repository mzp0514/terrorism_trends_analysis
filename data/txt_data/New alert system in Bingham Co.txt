Bingham County residents can receive instant messages about crimes or emergencies in their area through the AlertID program.
The Blackfoot Police Department, Aberdeen Police Department, Shelley Police Department and Bingham County Sheriff's Office recently joined the program.
AlertID is designed to help reduce crime and uses the newest technology to create instant, two-way communication between area residents and local, state and federal law enforcement agencies, according to a news release.
Residents who enroll in the program will receive emails and text messages free of charge, providing them with information on local crimes, acts of terrorism or natural disasters.
""It's designed to work around the neighborhood or location they live in,"" said Paul Hardwicke, community programs coordinator for Blackfoot Police Department. ""We try to keep it within a mile of where you live and it gives people a feel for what's going on in their neighborhood.""
Hardwicke said that because the Bingham County law enforcement agencies were the first in the state to partner with AlertID, there is no cost for the agencies to be members.
Police and emergency personnel also have the ability to broadcast urgent alerts through the program, ranging from Amber Alerts to fires to severe weather.
Idaho sex offender data also is available on the AlertID website. It also includes an online community watch program, crime map, sex offender map and other features available to residents of Bingham County.
Hardwicke said residents also can engage in neighborhood discussion on recent crimes. ""It's just another tool for crime prevention,"" he said.
To sign up to receive the alert messages, visit www.alertID.com.
