The differences between the United States and Venezuela appeared again in a General Assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS). Both countries accused each other of hosting terrorists, and Venezuelan Foreign Affairs minister, Nicolas Maduro, accused Washington of promoting an "operation" to "fill the region with violence". Mr. Maduro's words were "categorically" rejected by the US representative.
Also, Maduro accused US Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte of being "responsible for disappearances, for tortures and for deaths in Central America and in several parts of the world." Mr. Negroponte had called upon Venezuela to actively combat the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) that "have sought sanctuary" in its territory.
In turn, US ambassador to the OAS, Hector Morales, said that he had not seen a real Venezuelan condemnation of terrorism, and the oil-rich country's minister replied that the US should extradite Luis Posada Carriles to Venezuela if it is so concerned about combatting terrorism.
Posada Carriles is accused by Cuba and Venezuela of the 1976 bombing of a Cuban airliner which killed 73 people, among other attacks. Â© 2008 NoticiasFinancieras - NoticiasFinancieras - All rights reserved
