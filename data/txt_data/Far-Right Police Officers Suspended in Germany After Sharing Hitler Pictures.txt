The Interior Minister said he assumes there are more participants in such right-wing extremist communications groups who are also police officers.
"We have to ask unpleasant questions of ourselves", Reul said. 'Who knew about this?
"It is hard to find words", he added.
The material was exchanged in at least five WhatsApp groups used entirely or largely by police officers who worked at the same police precinct in Muelheim an der Ruhr.
Reul, the interior minister, said he had long hoped that such episodes were isolated exceptions. All have been dismissed from service and disciplinary proceedings have begun against them.

On Wednesday, Mr Seehofer's spokesperson cautioned against making "sweeping allegations" against the whole German police, which has 300,000 officers.
