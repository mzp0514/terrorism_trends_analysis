There is nothing in the University Operator's Manual to prepare you for this.
More than two dozen bomb threats in eight weeks, some of them messages scrawled in bathroom stalls, some of them emails bounced off servers in other countries. The evacuation of the Towers dormitories at 4 in the morning. The repeated emptying of the 42-story Cathedral of Learning. Bag searches and ID checks before allowing entry to some classroom buildings.
The first threat was a prank. By the time you reach No. 25 or 26, it's downright criminal. Not to mention contemptuous of the pursuit of higher education.
Yet through it all, University of Pittsburgh officials have done what they needed to do. They've taken every threat seriously. They've put a premium on safety. They, along with professors and instructors, have done all they can to keep the 29,000-student campus functioning.
Now the matter is not just something for the campus police, but a high priority for the FBI, the region's Joint Terrorism Task Force and behavioral sciences professionals. On Wednesday the U.S. attorney said he was focusing on "potential suspects."
Until investigators get to the bottom of this pointless, cowardly obsession, the university and every member of its community must continue to do what it does best -- focus on the learning. And be patient.
