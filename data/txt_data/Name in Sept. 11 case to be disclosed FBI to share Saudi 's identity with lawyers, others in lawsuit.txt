WASHINGTON - The U.S. said Thursday that it will disclose the name of a Saudi citizen sought by lawyers for victims of the Sept. 11 attacks who want to link the kingdom to the terrorist plot.
Attorney General William Barr had the option of invoking a "state secrets" privilege to withhold the release of the name, which lawyers for survivors and victims' relatives believe belongs to a Saudi government official who they say assigned two men in California to assist two of the hijackers.
Instead, Justice Department lawyers said in a court filing that the FBI will make the name available to a limited circle of people that includes lawyers for survivors and victims' relatives as well as to attorneys for the Saudi government. The decision is a big step forward for Sept. 11 victims, who allege in a long-running lawsuit that Saudi Arabia provided support for the attacks.
Victims' relatives believe that name could help them in establishing a link between the Saudi government and the Sept. 11 attacks, which is a matter of dispute. Barr invoked "state secrets" to block the release of other information in that report.
"This is a good result," Terry Strada, national chair of the 9/11 Families & Survivors United for Justice Against Terrorism, said in a statement.
