To the Editor:
The Aug. 18 attempt on the life of the Egyptian Interior Minister, Hassan al-Alfi, by militant Muslim fundamentalists and the Aug. 19 killing of nine Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon by Hezbollah terrorists mark further attempts by fundamentalists to create a reign of terror and murder.
It is all aimed at killing the peace process and establishing a Muslim fundamentalist empire headed by Iran from the Indian to the Pacific Ocean. Extremism is sweeping across the Sudan, Algeria, Afghanistan, Egypt and Lebanon, and creeping into the West Bank and Gaza with the violent acts of Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Muslim extremists also have strongholds or training bases in the United States and Europe.
Militant Muslim fundamentalists are the enemy of the world's democracies and all peace-loving nations. It is the responsibility of the free world and moderate Arab regimes to work together to combat Muslim fundamentalist terrorism worldwide.
The people of the Middle East have been paying a heavy toll, and they deserve a chance to better their lives in a peaceful environment. We should not allow terrorism to stop, even for an instant, the progress toward peace.
