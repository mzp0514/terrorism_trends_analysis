Editor, New Era:
Regarding editorials in the Aug. 14th and 21st New Era. Terrorism by any other name is the same.
#SEIPLE.LIB#There are those who care not to believe, or think we should bring our troops home, and radical activists whose only goal is to destroy us. Some blame 9/11 and/or anything that happens on the U.S., much like ABD (anything Bush does) is wrong.
We have learned, once again, that one cannot negotiate with terrorists or anyone who's fanatical. That goes for Hitler, Saddam, Arafat, etc. We tried for 12 years with Iraq, and with Israel and the Palestinians since 1948. With the Oslo Accords in 1993, somehow Arafat won the Nobel Peace Prize, a joke. They've been at war in the Mideast for thousands of years, and you think somehow we're the ones to pull a hat trick? The road map to peace is a map without a road, and a myth.
I hear the peaceniks and antiwar activists call for peace or bringing our troops home. What they don't say is what the alternative is, except that would invite terrorists to our homeland and war here instead. Families demand we bring our troops home, while forgetting why their sons/daughters joined to defend their country to begin with. They should support their children's wishes.
In fact, we must win in Iraq, or we will lose it all. There will be no lasting peace without war. In the last 4,000 years there's been no lasting peace.
