Sen. Hillary Clinton labels President Bush's war plan in Iraq "incompetent and ill-conceived" and with American troops fighting terrorism, calls the president's actions the "height of irresponsibility"(TH Jan. 28). I believe Sen. Clinton and her ilk in control of Congress are acting in the height of hypocrisy.
Let's not forget the pre-war intelligence that President Bush and both houses of Congress accessed were one and the same. Many of the current war critics called for action against Saddam Hussein's Iraq under the administration of President Clinton.
President Bush has proposed a plan to achieve victory in Iraq. Instead of firing worthless salvos and issuing non-binding congressional resolutions, Sen. Clinton should either propose her own solution or defund the war effort. Why undermine U.S. Armed Forces and attempt to embarrass President Bush if she has no counter solution?
Bush bashing has become a daily diatribe in the Telegraph Herald. I (although a minority in democratic Dubuque County) whole-heartedly support President Bush and our brave armed service personnel in their mission fighting global terrorism and defending freedom. It will be arduous for Sen. Clinton to enact laws favoring unfettered abortion, proliferating embryonic stem-cell research and promoting gay marriage if Islamic extremism marches down Capitol Hill, don't you think?
