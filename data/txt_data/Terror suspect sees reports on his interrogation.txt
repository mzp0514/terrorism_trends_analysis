Amid tight security, alleged al-Qaida operative Jos√© Padilla is being permitted to personally view U.S. government documents summarizing statements Padilla made during his years in military custody.
A federal judge allowed him to see the documents, which are classified, in advance of his trial on charges of conspiring to wage and support international terrorism.
Padilla is a U.S. citizen once accused by the federal government of plotting to detonate a radioactive "dirty bomb." He was held for 3 1/2 years in Defense Department custody, designated as an unlawful "enemy combatant." That designation was dropped last fall when he was charged in a Miami terrorism case.
U.S. District Judge Marcia Cooke's order, issued July 5, allows Padilla to view 32 Defense Department documents that summarize statements Padilla made. He also can examine 57 videotapes of interrogations he underwent during that same period.
Defense lawyers in terrorism cases are regularly permitted to examine classified material if they obtain government security clearances, but it is unusual for an actual terror suspect to be given direct access to secrets.
"There is not a long history of this. There have not been a lot of terrorist prosecutions in civilian courts," said Aitan Goelman, a former Justice Department terrorism prosecutor now in private practice in Washington.
