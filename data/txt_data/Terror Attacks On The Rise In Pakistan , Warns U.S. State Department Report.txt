(RTTNews) - The U.S. State Department said Thursday in its annual report on global terrorism that terror attacks in Pakistan have more than doubled between 2007 and 2008, and warned that the country is slowly becoming the strong-hold of the al-Qaeda and the Taliban.
"Pakistan&apos;s tribal areas provided AQ [Al-Qaeda] many of the benefits it once derived from its base across the border in Afghanistan," the report said, adding that the Taliban and other al-Qaeda-linked insurgent groups have increased the "co-ordination, sophistication and frequency&apos;&apos; of suicide and other bombings in Pakistan.
The report pointed out that terror attacks in Pakistan rose from 890 in 2007 to 1,839 in 2008, adding that Taliban and other al-Qaeda-linked militants were threatening the Pakistani government&apos;s authority.
"They have used this terrain as a safe haven to hide, train terrorists, communicate with followers, plot attacks and send fighters to support the insurgency in Afghanistan," the report said.
The report added that the international community&apos;s assistance to the Afghan government to build "counterinsurgency capabilities, ensure legitimate and effective governance, and counter the surge in narcotics cultivation is essential to the effort to defeat the Taliban and other insurgent groups and criminal gangs."
It also said that Iran remains the "most active state sponsor of terrorism" in the world, adding that Iran&apos;s support for terror-related activities in the Middle East and Afghanistan threatens efforts to promote peace in the regions.
