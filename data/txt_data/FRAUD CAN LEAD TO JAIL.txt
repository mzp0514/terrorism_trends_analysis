FLUNKING A green-card interview can have worse consequences than a dirty look from your new wife.
When USCIS officers suspect fraud, they send a case to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which then decides whether to bring criminal charges.
ICE focuses on taking down people and rings who make money by brokering fake pairs.
"We're generally looking at stopping pipelines instead of stopping individuals," said Special Agent in Charge James Hayes Jr., of the New York field office.
To gather enough evidence for federal prosecutors to bring fraud charges, ICE agents sometimes turn to social media sites.
"When they put on their Facebook status that they're in a relationship with someone and getting married to someone else, that's sort of a giveaway," Hayes said. "We're very, very creative when trying to make a case."
In addition to tips from USCIS, the agency relies on information developed during other probes - from visa scams to terrorism.
Agents investigating an alleged Mafia plot to import Russian strippers to the U.S. uncovered a marriage fraud ring.
Last fall, five suspects were charged with recruiting fake husbands to marry the exotic dancers so they could legally work in city strip clubs.
The girls allegedly paid thousands for sham marriages, and the cash was split between the phony grooms and the ringleaders.
Marriage fraud can land schemers in jail for up to five years. Because of a statute of limitation, someone who duped the system is in the clear once they've been a citizen for 10 years.
