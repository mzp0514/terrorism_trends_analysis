TAMPA - Federal prosecutors say a terrorism-related charge against a former University of South Florida student should not be dismissed, contending the student's Internet video was intended to provoke violent acts.
Attorneys for Ahmed Mohamed have filed a motion asking that a judge dismiss a charge that he tried to help terrorists by teaching or demonstrating the use of explosives. The defense maintains that Mohamed's YouTube video was protected by the First Amendment.
In the meantime, the defense has lost another round: U.S. Magistrate Mark Pizzo ruled that the prosecution does not have to provide more specific information about the terrorism-related charge to the defense. Mohamed's attorneys argued that the government had to specify which terrorist group he was trying to help, for example, but prosecutors successfully argued that the defense had been given sufficient information.
Authorities allege Mohamed posted a YouTube video in which he shows how to use a remote-controlled toy to detonate a bomb.
In the video, according to a prosecution court filing, "Mohamed instructed listeners on how to manipulate a toy car's circuitry to supply electricity 'to the detonator.' He further showed modifications of the remote control in a way that 'it will ignite the detonator' and thus 'make an explosion from a distance.'"
The defense disputes this depiction of the video and immediately filed a motion asking for permission to reply to the government's response to its motion to dismiss.
