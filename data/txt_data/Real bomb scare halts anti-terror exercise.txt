PORTLAND Â­- Better safe than sorry.
A bomb scare at the Lloyd Center Doubletree Hotel brought TOPOFF4, the largest anti-terrorism exercise in U.S. history, to a screeching halt Thursday afternoon.
Three bomb-sniffing dogs alerted Portland police to the possible presence of explosives in the hotel's parking garage.
A TOPOFF4 media briefing at the hotel was quickly canceled and police jumped into action.
The yellow tape went up, MAX trains were halted, and the hotel and nearby Benson High School were locked down.
Michael Chertoff, secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, was scheduled to be at the hotel but was whisked away when news of the bomb scare broke, a Federal Emergency Management Agency employee at the hotel said.
Hotel guests were stranded outside, and mall guests didn't seem to know what was going on.
e_SDLq It was not part of the drill," Sgt. Brian Schmautz, spokesman for the Portland Police Bureau, said of the bomb scare.
There was no bomb, and the situation was resolved shortly after 4 p.m., Schmautz said.
A car being driven by someone associated with TOPOFF4 appears to have caused the scare, he said.
There are two possibilities.
The first is that someone may  have been carrying a firearm that set off the dogs.
The second? One or more of the cars in the parking garage may have been covered with residue from a bus that was blown up on Tuesday as part of the terrorism exercise.
Either way, everything has been cleared, according to Schmautz.
"There is no danger to the community," he said.
