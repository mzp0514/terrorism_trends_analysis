"Biological warfare and bioterrorism are not new events," said Dr. Frank E. Young, a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner.
In fact, biological agents have been used as weapons since antiquity.
As early as the sixth century B.C., the Assyrians poisoned enemy wells with rye ergot, and the Athenian Greeks used the purgative plant hellebore - skunk cabbage - to poison the water supply during the siege of Krissa.
In A.D. 1346, plague broke out in the Tartar army during its siege of Kaffa in the Crimea. Trying to take some advantage from their own misfortune, the attackers hurled the corpses of the dead over the city walls.
The resulting plague epidemic forced Kaffa's defenders to surrender, and some infected people who left Kaffa may have contributed to the Black Death pandemic that killed from a third to half the people of Europe.
Still later, Napoleon attempted to infect the inhabitants of the besieged city of Mantua with swamp fever during his 1797 Italian campaign.
In World War I, the Germans tried to use anthrax against enemy draft animals, and in World War II, Japan employed anthrax, plague, cholera and salmonella, Young said.
During World War II, the United States began its own offensive biological program, ending it in 1969-70.
The biological warfare convention in 1972 outlawed the use of bioweapons in war, but that did not stop countries such as the Soviet Union and Iraq from developing them.
In this century, investigators have documented at least 45 cases of the illicit use of biological agents, 12 by terrorists.
