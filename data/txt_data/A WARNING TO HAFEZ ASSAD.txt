If Syria wants to be in the U.S. camp after the Persian Gulf War, it had better halt its support of terrorism. That is the upshot of the latest State Department report on countries that contribute to terrorism around the world, as required by U.S. law.
Syria is not the only country named; as usual, the list includes Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya and North Korea.  Given its potential role as a front-line Arab country in direct talks with Israel, Syria's name jumps out of the State Department's friends-of-terrorism list. With aid from Syria's sponsor, the Soviet Union, on the wane, President Hafez Assad is casting about among other nations for help. One is the United States, but as long as Damascus is a nerve center of terrorist activities, Mr.  Assad should expect no favors from the United States. No economic - and certainly no military - aid will go to Syria, even though its troops backed the U.S.-led U.N. coalition against Iraq.  Secretary of State James Baker has spent many hours with Mr. Assad in hopes of convincing him to take the plunge and meet face to face with Israeli leaders to start resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict. The State Department report noted, however, that the United States and Syria have fundamental differences over Syria's support for terrorist activities against Israel. This is a clear signal that if Syria is to end its isolation in the Middle East and begin improving its economy, it must kick the terrorist habit. Should it do so and join in a peace conference with Israel, the results could be dramatic - and positive.
