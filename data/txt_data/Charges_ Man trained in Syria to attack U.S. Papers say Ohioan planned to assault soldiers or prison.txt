An Ohio man traveled to Syria and trained alongside terrorists, then returned to the U.S. with plans to attack a military base or a prison, according to a federal indictment announced Thursday.
Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud, a U.S. citizen originally from Somalia, wanted to kill three or four American soldiers execution style, according to the indictment. Attacking the prison was part of a backup plan, the charges state.
The indictment also says Mohamud's brother, Abdifatah Aden, fought with Jabhat al-Nusrah, a State Department-designated terrorist group, until he was killed in battle in Syria in June.
Mohamud, 23, of Columbus, was charged with supporting terrorism, supporting the same terrorist group and lying to an Ohio FBI agent by saying he was in Istanbul when authorities say he was in Syria. He also is charged with making a false statement involving international terrorism.
The government charged Mohamud under the laws most commonly used since the Sept. 11 attacks to prosecute terrorism suspects. He faces up to 38 years in prison if convicted.
Mohamud was arrested in Columbus in February on state terrorism and money laundering counts. Thursday's charges were expected, and Mohamud is expected to plead not guilty at an arraignment today, his attorney said.
