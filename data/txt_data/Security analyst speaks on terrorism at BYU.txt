Fire, bombings, buildings collapsing, and terrorism will all be on campus this Wednesday, June 9, at noon in the Kennedy Center.
Homeland Security Analyst, Ryan Chavez, will speak on terrorism and his experience with the Department of Homeland Security. 
He will speak in Room 238 of the Herald R. Clark building.
Chavez's lecture titled "Homeland Security in an Age of Transnational Terrorism" will give an interesting viewpoint into the fight against terrorism because Chavez works for the Integrated Threat Reduction Center, said Valerie Hudson, a political science teacher who worked with Chavez while he was a student at BYU.
"He's on the frontlines of dealing with the new security issues after 9/11," she said. "He's in the trenches and he's going to give us some great insight into what kinds of things they're looking at, the kinds of things they are worried about and what kinds of actions they are taking to offset the threat."
The lecture, given as part of the Kennedy Center's Global Focus Series, will address this term's theme, "The Horrors of War," by discussing how terrorism has become a major warfare.
"Terrorism ... causes thousands and thousands of deaths and we now know that it isn't a one-time kind of threat, but that it is a constant threat," she said. "So it is part of war."
