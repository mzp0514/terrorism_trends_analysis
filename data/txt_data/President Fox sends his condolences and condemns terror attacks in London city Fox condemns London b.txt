President Vicente Fox on Thursday sent his condolences to the citizens of London and totally condemned a series of terror attacks that claimed at least three dozen lives.
Speaking from Gleneagles, Scotland where he has been attending the Group of 8 summit Fox offered "deeply felt" sympathies to the victims and their families and pledged his solidarity with British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
He also said all countries, including Mexico, face the threat of "acts of barbarism" and that democracies can not permit terrorists to triumph.
"In Mexico we have not had acts of terrorism, but this does not exclude us from the possibility of having them," he said. Mexico, he added, is totally open to global strategies in the fight against terrorism and he emphasized his participation with the United States and Canada in the North American Alliance for Security and Prosperity.
"In our area of influence, in North America, we have just finished coming to a great number of agreements in order to make America a secure area against terrorism and against organized crime," he said.
Fox said he and U.S. President George W. Bush also talked with "much frankness" about the tragedy in London and the impact it would have in the world.
"We have to bring our forces together in order to face all the terrorist acts. Everyone has to fight for security, and that is what we will continue to be doing," he said. The message to terrorists, he said, is clear: "This is not the way, and you are not going to win this battle in this manner." © 2005 NoticiasFinancieras - © 2005 GDA - El Universal - All rights reserved
