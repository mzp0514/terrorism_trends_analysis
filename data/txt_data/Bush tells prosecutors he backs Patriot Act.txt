President George W. Bush told federal prosecutors Tuesday that the Patriot Act was vital to keeping Americans safe.
Many key provisions of the domestic anti-terrorism law were to expire Dec. 31. In a move the White House adamantly opposed but later accepted, Congress approved a one-month extension of the law in its current form to allow the debate to continue. The new measure expires Feb. 3.
Bush said Tuesday that Congress must act on a permanent renewal of the law, which expanded the government's surveillance and prosecutorial powers against terrorism suspects and their associates and financiers.
He noted that the Patriot Act had been overwhelmingly approved soon after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. Now, he said, political considerations are getting in the way.
"When it came time to renew the act, for partisan reasons, in my mind, people have not stepped up and have agreed that it's still necessary to protect the country," said the president. He spoke while meeting at the White House with federal officials and 19 U.S. attorneys from around the country.
"The enemy has not gone away," Bush said. "They're still there."
Later, the district attorneys cited several cases in which the Patriot Act had played a crucial role -- from securing convictions of major terrorist financiers in New York to an undercover sting on California weapons dealers attempting to sell Stinger missiles.
But Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., said Bush should spend more time negotiating about the Patriot Act with Congress and less on what Feingold called "staged meetings with hand-picked participants."
