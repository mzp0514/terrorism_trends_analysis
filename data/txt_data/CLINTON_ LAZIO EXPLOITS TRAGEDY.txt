Hillary Rodham Clinton lashed out yesterday at Rick Lazio and state Republicans, charging they are "exploiting" the bombing deaths of 17 U.S. sailors by launching a telephone blitz of voters that accuses her of supporting "the same kind of terrorism."
Barely controlling her fury, Clinton said Lazio and the GOP "owe an apology to the families of the sailors" killed in the terror bombing of the destroyer Cole in Yemen. "I can't understand how anybody could in good conscience get up and look in the mirror and do this."
Lazio, however, was unapologetic, even as he tried to distance himself from the massive phone-bank operation by saying, "These are not phone calls that are done by my campaign."
"I don't think we need any instructions or lessons from the Arkansas political machine that Mrs. Clinton affiliates with," Lazio said in West Babylon, L.I., after holding a rally in a school gym with Gov. Pataki.
"We don't need any advice from . . . Hillary Clinton how to run campaigns in New York, especially from people who are now forced to return $50,000 to people who associate themselves with terrorism and violence in the Middle East."
The state GOP also stood by the mass dialing, which is expected to include more than 1 million calls.
The nasty turn in the Senate race came after a Muslim group whose members include some with extreme views on Israel said it sponsored a fund-raiser that produced $50,000 for Clinton's candidacy.
After the Daily News reported the American Muslim Alliance's claim, Clinton returned the $50,000, saying she was never told of its involvement. The group's leader says he backs achieving a Palestinian state though peaceful means "first and foremost," but that UN resolutions allow for Palestinians to use armed force.
The state GOP launched the phone banks with two separate messages, one targeting Jewish voters and one targeting non-Jews.
The scripts for both messages accuse the American Muslim Alliance of openly supporting a Mideast terrorism group. The message targeting Jewish voters identifies that group as "Hamas." The state GOP, however, could not produce evidence supporting either claim.
The GOP's message targeting non-Jews says Clinton "attended a $50,000 fund-raiser where she accepted a plaque and money from an Arab organization that openly brags about its support of a Mideast terrorism group, conducting the same kind of terrorism that killed 17 of our sailors."
It added, "We all know she will say and do anything to buy our U.S. Senate seat."
The message to Jewish voters adds, "Did you know that before Hillary Rodham Clinton started her run for our U.S. Senate seat, she supported a Palestinian state and also didn't support moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem?" That message calls the $50,000 "blood money."
Underscoring the Clinton campaign's concern, former Mayor Ed Koch, a Clinton supporter and a Jew, appeared at City Hall to denounce the phone banking. The First Lady's campaign also released a statement from Sen. John Kerry, a war hero, who called it "nothing short of disgraceful."
