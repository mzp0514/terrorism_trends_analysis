BOSTON (AP) - A $50,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest of a Massachusetts man facing terrorism charges, the FBI announced Wednesday.
The FBI's Boston office said it is seeking the public's help in locating Ahmad Abousamra, a U.S. citizen from Mansfield who left the United States in 2006 and may be living in Aleppo, Syria, with at least one child, a daughter, and extended family. He uses several aliases.
Abousamra, now 31, was indicted in 2009 after taking trips to Pakistan and Yemen where he allegedly attempted to obtain military training for the purpose of killing American soldiers overseas. He also traveled to Iraq.
A federal arrest warrant was issued in November 2009 after he was charged with conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists, providing material support to terrorists, conspiracy to kill in a foreign country and other charges.
The FBI says Abousamra is an associate of Tarek Mehanna, the Sudbury man convicted on four terrorism charges and sentenced this year to 17Â½ years in prison.
The FBI is releasing photos, a video, voice clip, "wanted" posters in English, French and Arabic, along with other media items in a publicity campaign aimed at generating tips about Abousamra's whereabouts.
Abousamra is of Syrian descent and has dual citizenship in the United States and Syria.
