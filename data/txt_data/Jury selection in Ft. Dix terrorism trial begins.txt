About 150 potential jurors filled out questionnaires yesterday as the process of picking a jury for the Fort Dix terrorism trial began in U.S. District Court in Camden.  
The multi-page questionnaire is designed to determine what potential jurors have heard about the case, and whether that knowledge or any other bias or prejudice should preclude them from sitting on the jury.  
The questionnaire has not been made public. 
The case centers on an alleged plot by five foreign-born Muslims from the Philadelphia area to attack the South Jersey military complex. 
Twelve jurors and six alternates will be chosen to hear testimony in the trial, which is expected to last several weeks.  
Judge Robert Kugler, who will preside over the trial, has ruled that for security reasons, the jurors will be chosen anonymously. 
Two groups of about 75 potential jurors reported to the federal courthouse yesterday, one group in the morning and the other in the afternoon.  
Members of each group filled out the lengthy questionnaire. Today, prosecutors and defense attorneys are expected to begin sifting through copies of those questionnaires to determine which jurors should be dismissed by mutual agreement. 
Meanwhile, two more groups will fill out questionnaires in morning and afternoon sessions today, part of a process expected to take the rest of the week.  
Kugler has said he hopes that sometime next week, the lawyers can begin individually questioning potential jurors to come up with the panel that will hear testimony.
