Representatives of Iowa's riverboat casinos fear that anti-terrorism rules under consideration for riverboats will take the fun out of gambling for their customers.
"We already have very significant security in place, with 24-hour video surveillance and our own security force to deal with contingency plans for any kind of adverse situation," said Wes Ehrecke, president of the West Des Moines-based Iowa Gaming Association, an industry group.
The nine Iowa riverboats, which had 12 million customers last year, also are monitored by the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation.
Under the rules being considered by the U.S. Coast Guard, customers at Iowa's nine floating casinos on the Mississippi and Missouri rivers could be required to pass through airport-style metal detectors and provide photo IDs before being allowed to board a riverboat, Ehrecke said.
Bags and purses could be inspected by guards, and other tough security precautions could be taken under federal regulations now being studied.
Representatives of Iowa's riverboat casino industry have been testifying at a series of Coast Guard hearings being held throughout the country. Coast Guard officials hope to adopt the new rules later this year.
"The goal is better security," said Dan Dewell, a Coast Guard spokesman in Washington, D.C. "That's the reason for the regulations and the meetings. We want the industry and the public and anyone who is affected to be involved."
All of the nation's 361 sea and river ports are being evaluated for vulnerability to terrorism.
