To the Editor:
Alan B. Krueger and Jitka Maleckova presented support for previously reported observations that suicide bombers are fairly well educated, moderately well off young persons, not impoverished, marginal youths ("Seeking the Roots of Terrorism," The Review, June 6). …
The authors propose that self-destructive acts are responses of individuals to frustrating political powerlessness. … The driving forces that motivate the individual bombers reside far deeper. Their acts are not solely reasoned -- their responses have been inculcated by intense conditioning and are not amenable to rational analysis.
Numerous young Palestinians have been exposed from an early age to a culture of hate and continued extended peer pressure that exalts the status of martyrs. They grow up immersed in the cult of revenge. But only a small fraction of these are chosen by their manipulators for the final critical indoctrination that leads to self-sacrifice. The agenda of these cold-blooded, calculating directors will not change when improvements in living conditions are instituted. …
A heavy hand is needed to control the sources of poison. I question whether the current changes in the Palestinian Authority can undo the damage that has already been done to the present generation and stop the continuing indoctrination of hate.
