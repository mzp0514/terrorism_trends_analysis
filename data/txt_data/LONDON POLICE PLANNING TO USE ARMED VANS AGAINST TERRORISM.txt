LONDON - London police are planning to introduce heavily armed patrol vans in July to tour the capital round-the-clock and to react instantly to ''terrorist attacks.'' Scotland Yard, the metropolitan police headquarters, said the new ''Armed Response Vehicles'' would be manned by members of its PT17 tactical firearms unit.
They also would be trained to deal with an upsurge in other armed incidents, a police spokesman said.  Equipped with handguns, automatic pistols and carbines, the vans also will carry bullet-proof clothing for the crew. British police on the beat are usually unarmed and must call on the firearms unit to deal with gun incidents.  The Irish Republican Army, fighting to oust Britain from Northern Ireland, came close to killing British Prime Minister John Major and key Cabinet members in a mortar attack on his 10 Downing Street office Feb. 7.  Days later the IRA bombed two railway stations in London, killing one man and injuring more than 40.  Chief Superintendent Frank Haughian, in charge of the fashionable Belgravia diplomatic quarter, said: ''It was felt we needed to introduce the armed patrols because of the increasing number of incidents arising from terrorist attacks on public buildings and public figures.''
