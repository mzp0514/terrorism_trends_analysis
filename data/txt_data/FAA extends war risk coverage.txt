The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has extended the war risk coverage it provides U.S. airlines to Dec. 31. The coverage had been scheduled to expire Aug. 31.
Under the program, airlines can purchase billions of dollars of limits to cover hull, passenger liability and crew personal-accident losses resulting from a terrorist attack. The first-dollar coverage costs a fraction of the amount that commercial insurers charge for terrorism coverage.
The amount of limits available to an airline is equal to twice the amount of standard hull and liability coverage it purchases from commercial insurers. The limits of policies currently in force range from $80 million to $4 billion, and the median average is $1.8 billion, according to a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Transportation.
The extension of the program has taken on additional significance in recent months, because insurers plan to press airlines to accept new exclusions that would bar coverage for losses resulting from weapons of mass destruction, biological and chemical agents, electromagnetic pulse and radioactive contamination (BI, Aug. 14). Now, if insurers succeed in imposing those exclusions, the reduced terrorism coverage would apply only to non-U.S. airlines.
Unless Congress acts, the FAA has the authority to extend its terrorism coverage program one more time, the DOT spokesman said. The FAA could extend the program for up to 15 more months beyond its new expiration date, or to as late as March 30, 2008, he said.
