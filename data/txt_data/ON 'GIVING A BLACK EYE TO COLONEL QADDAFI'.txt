To the Editor:
 The claim by The Times (editorial Aug. 20) that there was nothing wrong with the American attempt ''to test Colonel Qaddafi'' by conducting naval maneuvers in waters claimed by Libya is sorely mistaken.
hough it may be the case that ''giving a black eye to Colonel Qaddafi won't hurt America's global standing,'' it hardly seems justified to excuse aggressive military intentions with an appeal to the cold pragmatism of realpolitik.
Mark Packer letter disagrees with Aug 20 editorial approving US attempt to test Col Qaddafi by conducting naval maneuvers near LibyaEven if it were the case that Libya has no lawful claim to the waters in which the Gulf of Sidra confrontation occurred, there are international diplomatic means available for challenging the Libyan position that would have enhanced the American moral image abroad more effectively than saberrattling off the Libyan coast.
In recent years, as foreign nations have vented their hostility toward the U.S. with sanctioned terrorism and military provocation (e.g., the attack on the Mayaguez, the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Teheran), American diplomatic reaction has always appealed to the moral standards of decency, humanitarian concern and respect for our nation's sovereignty when voicing protest. Don't the simple dictates of consistency require that American foreign policy be executed in accordance with these same criteria?
