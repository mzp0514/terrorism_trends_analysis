The July 28 article ("War Against Terrorism Losing Steam,") should surprise no one. Many knowledgeable friends of the United States would not be surprised. These include former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak, and Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf. All noted the counter-productivity of military responses to terrorism. They argue that underlying causes must be addressed first.
Studies by the Rand Corp. have found that armed conflicts will increasingly occur in urban environments where modern weaponry is ill-suited, and where terrorism is well-suited. A CIA analysis of the situation in the Middle East noted that the number of unemployed, hope-deprived, angry young Muslim men is increasing rapidly. It concluded that terrorism would likely follow the same trend. All this sends the same message: Purely military approaches to terrorism won't work.
Human history over the past century sends the same message. Globally, nearly all armed conflicts over the past century were born in environments of extreme duress. Such environments supply fertile breeding grounds for entities such as the Taliban, Nazis, warlords and despots. A Muslim world of lands abused for centuries, of high population growth rates, of warlord and despotic rule all suggest environments of extreme duress.
Strategic use of pre-emptive brothers' keeper types of approaches could have eliminated most of these conflict-incubating environments and their consequences -- past and present. The costs would have been insignificant relative to both the costs of the armed conflicts and the misery these environments imply.
