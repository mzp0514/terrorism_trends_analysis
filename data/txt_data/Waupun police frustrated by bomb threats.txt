WAUPUN, Wis. - Waupun police are investigating a string of at least 10 bomb threats that have forced local establishments to evacuate and left local residents skittish about going downtown.
Police are frustrated because they have to take each threat seriously. The bomb threats, which began Sunday night, have been phoned in to fast-food restaurants, grocery stores, convenience stores and a high school.
"I've gotten calls from businesses that have concerns about being targeted next," Police Chief Dale Heeringa said. "Employees don't feel safe. It's actually like a terrorism thing going on in our community."
Heeringa said descriptions of the caller's voice vary, and the number that shows up on caller ID appears to be fake.
Even though no bombs have been found, authorities have to respond in full force, deputy police chief Scott Louden said.
"The sad part is that (callers) think it's a joke to upset the community's sense of security by calling in these bomb scares," he said.
A $200 reward was raised to $400 after a threat was called into Waupun Area High School early Wednesday. The district posted a notice alerting parents of the threat and letting them decide whether to send their children to school.
