A video image released by the Belgian Federal police shows a suspect wanted in connection with the March 22 attacks in Brussels. The Islamic State claimed responsibility.
Belgian police arrested five terrorist suspects Friday, including Mohamed Abrini, the last known fugitive on the run after November's deadly Paris attacks, a Belgian prosecutor said.
Eric Van der Sypt said it is unclear whether Abrini is the elusive "man in the hat" seen on surveillance video leaving Brussels Airport minutes before deadly bomb blasts March 22.
The attack, along with another suicide bombing at a Brussels metro stop, killed 32 people. The second suspect arrested Friday is identified as Osama Krayem, alias Naim al Ahmed, who the Belgian media said is linked to the subway attack.
The arrests came one day after authorities released videos of a man in a floppy hat and light-colored jacket pushing a luggage cart at the airport alongside two terrorists who blew themselves up in the attacks. The fugitive terrorist's bomb on the cart failed to detonate.
Authorities appealed to the public for any information on the suspect, who is seen in a series of videos walking along various streets in Brussels.
"We are investigating if Abrini can be identified as the third person at the Brussels national airport, the so-called man with the hat," Van der Sypt said.
Abrini, a Belgian Moroccan, was already wanted on international arrest warrants as a key suspect in the assault on the French capital Nov. 13 that killed 130 people. He was seen on surveillance video driving another terror suspect, Salah Abdeslam, to Paris two days before the deadly rampage.
