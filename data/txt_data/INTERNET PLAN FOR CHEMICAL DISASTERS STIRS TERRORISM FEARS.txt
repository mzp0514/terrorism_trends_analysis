WASHINGTON A government proposal to post potential casualty figures for disasters at all major U.S. chemical plants on the Internet is raising alarm that it will give terrorists a blueprint for attacks.
The FBI, the CIA, the chemical industry, the national fire chiefs' association and key members of Congress have all objected to the Environmental Protection Agency's idea for the "worst-case scenario" information.
The dispute highlights the challenges facing the government as it strives to make useful information available to citizens on the far-reaching Internet, where it can fall into unintended hands.
The data include chemical inventories as well as detailed information regarding where and how accidental chemical releases could occur in a worst-case scenario, how far released chemicals could travel and the populations that would be affected. The latter data amount to "the number of potential casualties from an attack on a particular facility," the FBI says.
Though concerns have been raised for 10 months, EPA has yet to craft an acceptable alternative. Recently, the FBI rejected the agency's idea to post the information on the Internet with certain "speed bumps" that would slow down access.
"This proposal has been reviewed within the FBI and the intelligence community and has generally been determined to be an ineffective means of protecting the information," Assistant FBI Director John Collingwood wrote Congress on Oct. 9.
