More West Virginians than ever are learning how to handle terrorist attacks.
Last year, about 15 emergency agencies took the free "Emergency Response to Terrorism" classes offered by the West Virginia University Fire Service Extension.
This month through January alone, the extension service has 36 classes scheduled.
"We offer them year-round," said Roger Johnson of the extension service. "We've had them for four years now. We were one of the first in the country."
Never has terrorism defense caught the attention of so many West Virginians, though. This year, the extension service is offering a new course, "Domestic Preparedness." It teaches emergency and medical workers how to initiate the correct response to a nuclear, biological or chemical attack.
The original "emergency response" course teaches them how to recognize a terrorist attack and then protect themselves and the public.
The instructors are trained by National Fire Academy teachers. The extension service has an $ 80,000 federal grant to teach the classes.
The instructors will travel anywhere in West Virginia, provided they've got a class of at least 10 firefighters, police officers, EMS workers or hospital personnel and a suitable place to hold the classes. The courses are usually two days long. The emergency response course is free. The domestic preparedness course may have a small fee for student manuals and the like, Johnson said.
For information, call Johnson at 293-2106.
