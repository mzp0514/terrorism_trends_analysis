To the Editor:
While Anthony H. Cordesman (Op-Ed, Oct. 23) is correct that Palestinian poverty threatens the Arab-Israeli peace process, his policy prescription skirts a crucial dilemma: Palestinian economic growth and long-term Israeli security are unlikely to move in a positive direction until they are seen as separate issues.
Mr. Cordesman criticizes the Palestinian Authority for being "too slow to understand that economic growth and sovereignty depend on its ability to halt terrorism." He notes that Israel "overreacted by imposing harsh security measures" and blocking exports and laborers from leaving the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The implication is that the reverse -- tougher Palestinian security measures coupled with a more relaxed Israeli stance -- would inhibit terrorism and promote Palestinian prosperity.
But what if the Palestinians failed to halt terrorism? Economic and political benefits are slow to materialize even under the best of conditions, and some militants are likely to commit violence long into the future. Given a perception of Palestinian failure on halting terrorism, Israeli punitive measures would again derail Palestinian economic hopes.
A better approach would be to de-link economics and security for the sake of Israel's long-term security. Allowing the movement of Palestinian exports and labor, as well as minimizing border closures, would give more Palestinians something to lose and generate more internal calls for stopping anti-Israel violence.
Palestinian poverty will undermine peace prospects, but a security litmus test, whether the enforcer be Israeli or Palestinian, is a way to guarantee continued economic stagnation.
