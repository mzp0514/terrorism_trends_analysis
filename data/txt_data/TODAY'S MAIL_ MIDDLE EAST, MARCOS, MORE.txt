I was struck by the State Journal's Aug. 31 list of ''Facts about Palestinians.'' Although these facts were accurate, much was omitted.
Alan K. Gorenstein, MadisonFor example, you state that Zionists began settling in what the British called Palestine in the 1800s. This is only factual because the Zionist movement was founded in the 1800s. Jews, on the other hand, had been settling there (and living there consistently) since Biblical times.
You state that ''In 1967, Israel captured east Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan and Gaza from Egypt.'' You did not state that this resulted from an unprovoked attack on Israel by its surrounding Arab neighbors. (Precisely like the Arab assault on Israel in 1956. Following the 1956 attack, the Arab defeat, Israel withdrew from the territories that are today in dispute, only to face unprovoked Arab aggression again in 1967.)
You also state that ''In 1988, Arafat renounced terrorism and convinced the Palestinians' ''parliament-in-exile'' to recognize Israel, but Israel refuses to deal with him.'' In 1990, Saddam Hussein disavowed violence, but his actions in subsequent months proved his claims were meaningless. How much more true is this of Arafat, who has been responsible for the deaths of innocent citizens for decades.
