U.S. President George W. Bush Wednesday urged the United Nations to pass a worldwide ban on the incitement of terrorism. The ban, proposed by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, would prevent nations from offering terrorists "safe havens" in their countries and providing them with aid, fiscal or otherwise, that would incite them to commit a terrorist act. 
The ban was later passed unanimously by the general assembly, in a show of the solidarity of nations.
Unfortunately, what was done at the United Nations was only a show. Such a ban, which should be common sense to every nation anyway, has no real way of being enforced. First, to prove a nation was inciting terrorists to engage in terrorist activity is near impossible. Second, even if it was provable the United Nations could do nothing more than propose a resolution against the offending nation, which could also be ignored if passed.
No country would dare go against this proposal, for if they did the rest of the world would condemn them. Instead, the nations pay lip service by saying they will not help the terrorists and then go about their business as usual.
The resolution does not affect countries that are not a part of the United Nations. Therefore, the terrorists could flee to these nations if all others were to deny them a "safe haven."
This goes to the heart of the question as to the usefulness of the United Nations as an international governing body. The United Nations is distanced from the world, as they operate outside of any individual country. They have no standing army, and cannot enforce any resolution independently of sponsoring nations.
