To the Editor:
Factual precision may not be the dominant value of the Soviet journalism that defines reporting as ''agitation by facts.'' But since Genrikh Borovik chose to publish his article (''A Russian Views U.S. News,'' Op-Ed Jan. 7) in a newspaper allegedly professing slightly different criteria of newsworthiness, may I draw your reader's attention to the following.
As a student of the coverage of the U.S.S.R. in the American press, I have not been able to find any of the headlines Mr. Borovik cites - with the exception of ''Cuban Brigade'' - in the ''national,'' major and most prestigious newspapers: The Times, The Washington Post, The Christian Science Monitor, The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal.
L Rabinovich letter responds to January 7 op-ed article, "A Russian Views US News" by Genrikh Borovik
However, if one examines, most cursorily, the Soviet counterparts of these newspapers, the so-called all-Union, or central, press, the ''selling of fear,'' which provoked Mr. Borovik's indignation, appears to be in full swing there. Here are just a few examples of headlines that appeared in those papers from June 23 to July 26 of last year. (This period has been chosen for a relatively mild, routine character of the anti-American propaganda.)
Pravda (circulation 11 million): ''Plot Against Libya'' (June 27), ''Escalation of Madness'' (June 27), ''The Scheming of American Secret Services'' (July 17).
Izvestia (circulation 8.6 million): ''Fly-Wheels of the Dangerous Race'' (July 11), ''Moles Come Out of the Holes'' (July 16).  Krasnaya Zvezda (estimated circulation over 5 million): ''Defense?  No, Preparation for Aggression'' (July 7), ''Stake on Violence'' (July 17).
Sovetskaya Rossia (circulation 2.7 million): ''Terrorists and Pharisees'' (June 23), ''Contract to Kill'' (July 25).  Selskaya Zhizn (estimated circulation at least 3 million): ''Who Promotes Terrorism'' (July 22), ''Threat to the Indian Ocean'' (July 26), ''Escalation of Violence'' (July 23).
Incidentally, could you ask Mr. Borovik to return the favor and arrange the publication of this letter in Pravda?
