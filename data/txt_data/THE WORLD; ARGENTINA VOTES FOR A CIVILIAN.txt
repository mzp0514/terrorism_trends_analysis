Under the shadow of a dictator who has been dead for nine years, Argentina is making another stab at democratic civilian rule today with its first presidential election in a decade. The movement established by Juan Domingo Peron, which has provoked two military coups in the past 28 years, is alive and well and its latest leader, Italo Luder, stands a good chance of being elected.
Mr. Luder's challenger, Raul Alfonsin, tried to offset Peronism's magnetism among the poor - the descamisados or shirtless ones - by appealing to the middle class. Mr. Alfonsin dwelt on such Peronist hallmarks as autocratic rule, official terrorism and labor corruption and drew large crowds with his fiery style. Mr. Luder is relatively colorless but big portraits of Peron at his rallies were enough to remind the crowds of his heritage. ''Peronism until death,'' a supporter proclaimed at a rally last week in Cordoba. ''We have only one leader - Peron - but Luder is part of the doctrine.''
The Argentine economy, which Peron helped drive into the ground in the early 1950's, is again in such a parlous state and the population is so alieniated that the military appears in a hurry to end its seven years of rule. Today's winner may take office in December rather than in January. If it is Mr. Luder, the generals and admirals are expected to keep a particularly suspicious eye on things.
