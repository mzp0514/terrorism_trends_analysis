TO THE EDITOR:
The president says Judge Michael Mukasey can't answer the questions about waterboarding because he has not been briefed on the program. But had the judge been briefed on this classified program, he could not legally testify about it. This is doublespeak and surrealism that surpasses Orwell and Kafka by virtue of its being real.
The Army Field Manual prohibits waterboarding, U.S. soldiers have been prosecuted for water boarding. The U.S. prosecuted Japanese war criminals for waterboarding. I haven't been briefed on the program, but I know it is torture. In our heart of hearts we all know waterboarding is torture.
The question becomes: Does it matter that the United States is abandoning its ideals, losing its soul, and surrendering its moral authority out of fear and the inability to do the difficult work of devising policies to defeat terrorism rather than create new adherents or terrorism?
The Senate Judiciary Committee has an opportunity to help rebuild America's moral authority in the world by blocking the nomination of Judge Mukasey, an otherwise qualified man who must be disqualified for his refusal to say what should never be difficult to say: torture is illegal.
