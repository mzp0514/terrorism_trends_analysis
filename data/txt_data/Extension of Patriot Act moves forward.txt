WASHINGTON ? Congress headed toward approval of a four-year extension of expiring provisions of the Patriot Act after the Senate voted overwhelmingly on Monday to advance the anti-terrorism law, despite the objections of a coalition of conservatives and liberals. 
Because of strong support from the Obama administration, a bipartisan majority in the House and Senate is expected to ensure passage this week, preventing a lapse of federal enforcement powers. Key provisions are set to expire on Friday. 
"It is essential to avoid any hiatus in these critical authorities," the White House said in a statement of administration policy. 
The law has troubled civil libertarians and conservatives since its enactment after the Sept. 11 attacks. The debate has drawn new interest from the Tea Party movement, whose supporters argue that the law gives the federal government too much authority to spy on terrorism suspects. 
Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., led opposition to the measure on the Senate floor yesterday, arguing that the act allows the federal government to peer too deeply into Americans' private lives. He questioned the wisdom of trading privacy for national security. 
"We cannot give up our liberty. If we do, if we trade it for security, we'll have neither," Paul said.
