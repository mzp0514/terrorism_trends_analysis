MUNICH Germany's interior minister said Saturday that investigators turned up no link between Friday's deadly shooting rampage in Munich and international terrorism, but did find that the 18-year-old German-Iranian gunman was fascinated with mass killings, particularly an attack in Norway five years ago.
Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere, Germany's top security official, identified the gunman in the attack that left nine people dead only as David, while the German media gave his name as Ali David Sonboly. The gunman died of a self-inflicted gunshot.
De Maiziere said David researched a 2009 school shooting in Germany, as well as the attack by anti-immigrant agitator Anders Behring Breivik, who killed 77 people in Norway in July 2011.
Initial investigations suggested that the shooter, the son of two asylum seekers from Iran who came to Germany in the late 1990s, had been treated for psychological problems. Police Chief Hubertus Andrae said Saturday there were signs the gunman suffered from depression.
The dead included three "youngsters," police said. Three people among 27 injured remained in critical condition. The shooting began outside a McDonald's and later erupted at the Olympia shopping mall. Munich police said the gunman apparently hacked a Facebook account and sent a message urging people to come to the mall for a giveaway.
Stanglin reported from McLean, Va.
