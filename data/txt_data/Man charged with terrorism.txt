Police said a 43-year-old Dubuque man was arrested Sunday for terrorizing his former supervisor at John Deere Dubuque Works for the past four years.
Ralph Weinbender, 978 Spires Court, faces a charge of fourth degree criminal mischief and a charge of terrorism.
Weinbender was being held in the Dubuque County Jail on a $10,000 cash bond.  Terrorism carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.
Police said Weinbender fired six .22-caliber rounds in 1992 into a home on Clarke Crest Drive where Steven Ressler and his family were sleeping
No one was injured in the shooting but several bullets were lodged in the wall of the bedroom where Ressler's children were sleeping.
Ressler was Weinbender's supervisor at John Deere and participated i in an investigation which led to Weinbender's dismissal, police said.
Although witnesses at the scene identified the make of car Weinbender drove, a Toyota Supra, police did not have enough evidence to obtain a search warrant;
A warrant was obtained in the fall of 1995 for a second shooting incident that took place in 1993. Police said Weinbender used a BB gun to break a window in Ressler's home.
The search of Weinbender's home yielded a gun equipped with a silencer. Ballistic tests matched the six bullets recovered from Ressler's home to Weinbender's gun.
Silencers are banned under state and federal law. Police have alerted the FBI about the silencer.
Ressler installed a security camera after the 1992 shooting and videotaped the BB gun shooting, but police were unable to identify Weinbender on the tape until last year.
Poliee also said Weinbender on other occasions harassed the family and would often drive slowly past Ressler's house.
