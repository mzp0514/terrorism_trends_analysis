Man sought in Henrico on assault, larceny charges
HENRICO Police are looking for a 22-year-old Richmond man wanted on a slew of charges, including larceny and assault.
Tyrell Eliphues Davis, whose last address was in the 4100 block of North Avenue, is sought in connection with two felony larceny charges, two assault charges, unlawful entry, vandalism, trespassing and obstruction. The charges stem from three incidents at the homes of two women Davis knows, said Lt. Linda Toney, a Henrico Police spokeswoman.
On Jan. 29, police were called to the 3900 block of Elberon Court, where a woman said Davis had pushed her and taken an item.
On May 19, police were called to the 100 block of Engleside Drive, where Davis had allegedly assaulted another woman, stealing an item and preventing the woman from calling police. Davis is also charged with breaking into the Elberon Court home on May 26, vandalizing a door and trespassing.
No serious injuries were reported in any of the incidents. Davis is black, about 5 feet, 11 inches tall and weighs about 195 pounds.
Anyone with information is asked to contact Henrico Police at (804) 501-5000 or Crime Stoppers at (804) 780-1000. You can also text Crime Stoppers at 274637, using the key word "ITip" followed by the tip. Both Crime Stoppers methods are anonymous.

Guardsman's terrorism charge called unjustified
MARTINSBURG, W.Va. The lawyer for a Virginia National Guard member arrested for running near a school while carrying a training rifle said a terrorism charge against his client is unjustified.
Attorney Kevin Mills said the fact that people felt threatened is subjective and a loose interpretation of the law that he believes a court would reject.
Mills said there's no evidence that 23-year-old Martinsburg resident William Everett Alemar threatened anyone.
Prosecutors said he was drunk when arrested this week.
