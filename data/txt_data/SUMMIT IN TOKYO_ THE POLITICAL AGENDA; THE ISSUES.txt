Terrorism The allies will discuss a common approach to terrorism in light of the American conflict with Libya and issue a statement that is expected to call for better coordination by intelligence and security officials. They are expected to state their determination to deal jointly with the problem, without necessarily endorsing either economic or military retaliation.
East-West Relations
The leaders will discuss the situation in the Soviet Union and the state of relations between Moscow and the major Western nations. They will review the outlook for summit meetings this year between the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and President Reagan and between Mr. Gorbachev and President Francois Mitterrand. Other topics will include East-West trade, people-to-people contacts and a number of East-West conferences now being held.
 
Arms Control
Special attention will be given to a review of the different arms control negotiations with the Soviet Union and, in particular, the lack of progress at the talks in Geneva, which are to resume on May 8.
 
Middle East
The lack of progress in Middle East negotiations will be discussed, along with the wish of the allies for an end to the Iran-Iraq war. President Reagan will take up with the other leaders the idea of a ''Marshall Plan'' under which the major industrialized countries would help the Middle East nations as a way of encouraging regional cooperation.
 
Narcotics
Discussions will be held on better coordinating action against the common problem of illegal naroctics activity.
