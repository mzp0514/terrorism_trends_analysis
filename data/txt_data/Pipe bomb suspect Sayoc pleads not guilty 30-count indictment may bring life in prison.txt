NEW YORK - Pipe bomb suspect Cesar Sayoc, accused of mailing explosive devices to prominent Democrats and critics of President Donald Trump last month, pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges he used weapons of mass destruction in a domestic terrorism plan.
Sayoc, 56, sat silently as his attorney entered the plea to a 30-count criminal indictment in Manhattan federal court.
If found guilty of the most serious charges, he could be sentenced to life in prison.
U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff scheduled a preliminary trial date of July 15.
Packages that allegedly contained improvised explosive devices were mailed last month to former President Barack Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden, former secretary of State Hillary Clinton, billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros, actor-director Robert De Niro and other Trump critics.
Authorities captured Sayoc in Plantation, Florida, on Oct. 26.
Investigators found the packages and disarmed the suspected pipe bombs before any exploded. No one was injured. Sayoc allegedly mailed 16 of the devices.
Federal prosecutors plan to seek experts in explosives, forensic chemistry and DNA and fingerprint analysis as potential trial witnesses, Assistant U.S. Attorney Emil Bove told Rakoff during Thursday's hearing.
