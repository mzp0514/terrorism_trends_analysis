COPS IN THE Rockaways have been targeted for an attack with "Drano bombs," the Daily News has learned.
The NYPD issued a citywide alert Tuesday warning officers about "Drano bombs," also known as "bottle bombs," that "are exploded by readily mixing available household products in plastic containers."
Police sources said that while the alert went to every precinct, the greatest concern is in the Rockaways.
The sources said police recently learned from informants that gang members and other troublemakers talked about throwing bombs at police officers or placing them near patrol cars.
"It's not terrorism," one source said. "It's (criminals). The alert is being issued out of precaution."
A second source said police are trying to determine if the plot is tied to any recent police activity, or if someone heard about it on the Internet and spread the word.
"Does it matter?" the source said. "Whatever the reason is, these things are dangerous."
By late Thursday, no officers in the Rockaways or elsewhere had been injured, nor had any such devices been found.
Drano bombs, which can be made with any drain or toilet cleaner that contains hydrochloric acid, can cause chemical burns to the skin or even blindness.
