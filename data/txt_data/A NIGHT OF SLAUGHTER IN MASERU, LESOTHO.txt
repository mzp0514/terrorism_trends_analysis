To the Editor:
 It's simply not good enough to treat the South African raid in Maseru, Lesotho (news story Dec. 9), as a pre-emptive strike or, even worse, as an Entebbe-type spectacular. Seen from Maseru, the basic fact is entirely more horrifying.
It's simply not good enough to treat the South African raid in Maseru, Lesotho (news story Dec. 9), as a pre-emptive strike or, even worse, as an Entebbe-type spectacular.Like thieves in the night, armed forces, with bombs and machine guns, enter houses where their enemies are asleep and kill whoever is there. Chance visitors also die. Without check, without pause, without parley, with no process of justice, with massive, shocking force, 20, 30, 40 young people are torn to pieces.
What happens to the traditions of negotiation, of mercy, of respecting life even in war? What happens to the effort to honor life, what happens to the consciences that once were Christian and that now permit all that is expedient?
If we don't denounce these things, isn't it clear that we are sliding into more brutal ways?  Isn't this linked in South Africa to the fact that we are defending injustice? It is our guilty conscience that panics and kills. And the dead are in the first case not ''terrorists'' but young men and women, victims, refugees.
In Northern Ireland, in Lebanon, the highest form of terrorism is to seek out and selectively destroy your enemies. Aren't we in danger of ourselves becoming terrorists, real terrorists?
What happens then to what we love, or once loved? Those whom the Lord begot innocent, says Deuteronomy, have become crooked, false, perverse. Is it thus that you repay the Lord?
J.E. STEWART Maseru, Lesotho, Dec. 13, 1982
