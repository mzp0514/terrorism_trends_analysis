Authorities have accused two Cedar Rapids men of terrorism and harassment towards a Burge resident.
Christopher Brown, 25, is suspected of terrorism, tampering with a witness/juror, and first-degree harassment on April 16.
Perrion Scott, 21, is suspected of first-degree burglary, first-degree harassment, and tampering with a witness/juror on April 15 and April 16.
According to the affidavit, Scott, Brown, and three others went to Burge Residence Hall on April 15 and knocked on the victim's door. Scott and the victim were previously romantically involved.
The victim saw Scott through the peephole on her door and attempted to lock it, the affidavit said, but Scott got through the door and pushed the victim back.
The victim later told officers she had some bruising and pain on her shoulder, the affidavit said.
Scott's current girlfriend assaulted the victim, the affidavit said, and then all five defendants fled.
On April 16, the affidavit said, Brown and Scott FaceTimed the victim and said if she called the police about the assault, there would be "shells, and not seashells" at her mom's house.
The victim expressed fear for her and her mother's safety, the affidavit said.
The victim told officers, the affidavit said, Brown and Scott are cousins, live together, and possess two shotguns at their home.
Terrorism and first-degree burglary are Class-B felonies.
