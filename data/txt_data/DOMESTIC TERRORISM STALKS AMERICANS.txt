Editor, Times-Dispatch:
At 1:15 p.m. a call goes out to 911. Three teens are seen walking the street carrying a gun.
"If the officer needs to speak with you, will that be okay?" I'm asked. "Sure," is the reply.
At 2:00 p.m. several sirens are heard. Is this because of the same teens? No, they are still seen wandering the neighborhood for another two hours.  No sign of the police. Thursday morning, 3:10 a.m., the sound of multiple gunshots awakens us. The same teens?
September 11 was not the first day of the terrorist attacks, and not all of the terrorists come from the Middle East. Many sit at our dinner tables, sleep under our roofs, and attend our schools. Many citizens feel hopeless because of the attacks in September, but what about everyday life? What about your child who is walking down my street with a gun?
The police say this is a community problem - that the community needs to be more involved and inform them when there is a problem. Agreed; where are the parents of these kids? Am I the only one seeing all of these kids hanging out?
More important, where were the police when called? Time and again we hear of community members calling, only for the police to respond after it's too late, when someone is finally shot. I guess in Chesterfield we now have to be like Richmond and learn to duck and cover.
As for me, Joel 3:10: "Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into spears. Let the weakling say, 'I am strong!' " It is 4:30 a.m. and we still can't get back to sleep. I tell my wife, "I think it's time to get a gun."
