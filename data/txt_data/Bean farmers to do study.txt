The Ag Products Utilization Commission has awarded money to a group of farmers who raise edible beans so it can proceed with a marketing study.
The $ 35,000 grant was awarded to the Lewis and Clark Bean Cooperative, which has about 60 members.
"We would do our feasibility study and marketing survey through the summer...and next fall do a business plan," said Paul Anderson, one of the farmers in the co-op. "Do a stock offering next winter...and have concrete and steel going up next spring."
Each of the co-op's members has contributed $ 250 to fund the marketing plan.
Anderson said their goal is to build a plant that will turn the central North Dakota's dry beans into a ready-to-cook or ready-to-eat product.
Attack threats not surprising
FARGO (AP) -- A terrorism expert at North Dakota State University says he's not surprised at FBI warnings of possible Serb terrorist attacks in the United States.
Federal authorities warned military bases and other federal installations last week to be prepared for attacks in retaliation for NATO air strikes in Yugoslavia.
"Terrorism becomes the language the small country can use against the big country," NDSU professor John Helgeland said.
"And terrorism is something that they imagine in our country can get maximum effect, because Americans are relatively not used to violence on that scale on our soil."
