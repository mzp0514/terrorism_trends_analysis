The Justice Department has indicted three men connected with the terrorist organization Hamas on charges of money laundering, first-degree murder, and hostage-taking.
Attorney General John Ashcroft said Friday that Muhammad Salah of Chicago, Abdelhaleem Ashquar of the Washington area, and Mousa Abu Marzook, who now resides in Damascus, Syria, "coordinated and financed the activities of Hamas within the United States and elsewhere."
According to the indictment, the Justice Department is seeking the forfeiture of $2.7 million held by the three men in several accounts, including accounts at Standard Bank and Trust in Hickory Hills, Ill., ABN Amro's LaSalle Bank in Chicago, and the First National Bank of Chicago.
The indictment also said Mr. Marzook maintained numerous bank accounts in Ohio, Wisconsin, New York, Mississippi, and Virginia in the late 1980s and early 1990s to help finance Hamas.
Mr. Marzook and Mr. Salah have previously been designated as terrorists by the Office of Foreign Asset Control. Mr. Salah and Mr. Ashquar were arrested Thursday, Mr. Ashcroft said. Mr. Marzook is still at large.
