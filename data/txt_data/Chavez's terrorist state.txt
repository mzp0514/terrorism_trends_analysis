A Spanish indictment makes a slam-dunk case for adding Venezuela to the U.S. State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism, which already names Cuba, its de facto conjoined twin, plus Iran, Syria and Sudan. 
Spain's anti-terrorism court contends Venezuela's government cooperated with the Basque separatist terror group ETA and the Marxist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which have plotted to assassinate Colombia's president. Among those indicted is ETA militant Arturo Cubillas Fontan -- who's also a Venezuelan government official. 
Spanish authorities call Mr. Fontan a murder suspect who's been responsible for ETA in that part of Latin America since 1999 and coordinates dealings with FARC. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has called him a Ministry for Land and Agriculture deputy director since 2005. 
That's about as cut-and-dried a basis for declaring Venezuela a state sponsor of terrorism as is possible. Add that to Mr. Chavez's many prior links to FARC, and the question becomes: What's State waiting for? 
A U.S. "state sponsor" designation would restrict foreign aid and ban defense exports and sales to Venezuela. Given the threat that both ETA and Chavez pose, it's a label Venezuela richly deserves.
