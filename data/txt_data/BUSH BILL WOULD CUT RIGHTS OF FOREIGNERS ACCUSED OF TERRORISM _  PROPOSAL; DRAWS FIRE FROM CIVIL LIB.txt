WASHINGTON - The anti-crime bill that President George Bush has sent to Congress would permit the government to hold special tribunals in which foreigners accused of terrorism would not be allowed to rebut or even see some or all of the evidence against them.  Justice Department officials say the tribunals, would require the approval of a federal judge.  They would give the government a mechanism to deport alien terrorists without being forced to disclose evidence that would reveal the identity of confidential sources, make public the nature of investigative methods or damage relationships with foreign countries.  The department says the tribunals would not be needed in most terrorism cases - only in those in which the evidence was particularly sensitive.  But some civil liberties experts say the proposal would violate fundamental principles of American law: That the government's evidence against a person must be public and that the accused has a right to be informed of that evidence and rebut it.  The provision has been largely overlooked until now in the public debate over the anti-crime bill but is drawing increasing fire from civil libertarians as the larger measure nears Senate consideration this month.  A similar proposal was offered several years ago by Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee.  It was subsequently incorporated into anti-crime legislation submitted by the administration of then-President Ronald Reagan, but that bill was never passed.  The greatest support for the idea now appears to be coming from within the Justice Department.
No congressional hearings have yet been held on the proposal.  But aides on Capitol Hill said it was likely to encounter strong opposition on civil liberties grounds, although they acknowledged that heightened anxiety over terrorism after of the Persian Gulf War might lend it additional support.  Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., who heads a House civil rights subcommittee, predicted that most Democrats on the panel would oppose the provision. ''We need no secret courts in America,'' he said. ''There are other ways of handling problems like they seem to fear. There's a Kafkaesque tinge to all of this.'' The Supreme Court has long held that aliens living in the United States who face deportation are entitled to constitutional protections, including a public hearing in which the government is barred from keeping evidence against them a secret.  Existing immigration law permits the government to prevent a foreigner from entering the United States on the basis of evidence that can be withheld from that person. The administration's proposal now seeks to apply similar procedures to foreigners already living in the United States.  ''We're faced with the dilemma of either declassifying information we have about an alien, and compromising our intelligence-gathering methods and endangering human sources, or we have to allow an alien who we know is providing material support to a terrorist group to remain in this country, '' said Steven R. Valentine, a deputy assistant attorney general who oversees the Justice Department's immigration litigation office.  The special proceedings could be initiated by the Justice Department against any alien who had ''engaged in terrorist activities,'' as defined by the Immigration Act of 1990. Under that law, terrorism includes support activities such as fund-raising and recruiting members for a terrorist group.  As a result, the government could seek the deportation of a person who raised money for the African National Congress, for example, or anti-government forces in El Salvador, said David Cole, a Georgetown University law professor who works for the Center for Constitutional Rights and who opposes the proposal.  ''The government will obviously be very political about who would be considered a terrorist,'' Cole said. ''Groups that will be targeted will be those that the administration doesn't approve of politically.'' But Valentine said that the procedure ''would not be invoked lightly'' and suggested that it would be applied in relatively few cases.  Using ordinary deportation procedures, he said the government was currently seeking the removal of two aliens for associatin g with a terrorist group.  Both are Palestinians living in California.
