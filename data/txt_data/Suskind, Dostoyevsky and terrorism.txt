Ron Suskind is as great a writer and thinker as he is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist. So his books can be read again and again with enjoyment and profit. One of them is his 2008 book, "The Way of the World: A Story of Truth and Hope in an Age of Extremism." In the front of the book, Suskind has a rather obscure quotation from Fyodor Dostoyevsky's "The Brothers Karamazov" that is both surprisingly simple yet, in my opinion, intriguingly helpful.
"As a general rule," the quotation begins, "people, even the wicked, are much more naive and simple-hearted than we supposed. And we ourselves are, too."
Suskind's book is largely about post-9/11 terrorism and our fiercely militant response to it. By using this quotation, I think he means to ask himself and his readers two questions. The first might be, is it possible for us to think of terrorists, and even ourselves, as much more naive and simple-hearted than we suppose? And the second question might be, would it be helpful for us to do so? I am not sure such an attitude would be possible in today's environment, but if it were, I think it would indeed be helpful.
If it is true that pride comes before the fall, it may also be true that the way back may be a simple-hearted, yet well-informed, calm and genuine humility that could look clearly at ourselves, at our own activities and errors, and then to look fearlessly into a face of hatred and see a fellow human being.
