Prosecutors dropped terrorism charges in the cases of two men who were arrested after buying large numbers of cellphones. The officials said they could not prove a terrorism link. The dismissal was announced a day after the Washington County prosecutor, James E. Schneider, said he did not have enough evidence to present felony charges to a grand jury. The men, Ali Houssaiky and Osama Sabhi Abulhassan, both 20 and both of Dearborn, Mich., paid a reduced bond on the remaining misdemeanor counts of falsification and left jail.
