Associate Editor Dan Simpson had a column praising Jimmy Carter as a peacemaker ("Jimmy Carter, Peacemaker, Realist," April 23) at the same time U.S. News & World Report ran a lengthy article condemning Mr. Carter for having a "blind spot about terrorism." Mr. Carter met with terrorist mastermind Khaled Mashaal, leader of Hamas, who is responsible for dozens of suicide bombings and thousands of rockets that have killed and injured hundreds of Israeli citizens.
Jimmy Carter has a history of support for Hamas, which is a terror group with much blood on its hands.
Mr. Carter asserts that the initial violence occurred when "Jewish militants" attacked Arabs in 1939. He ignores the fact that Arabs launched terrorism against Jews in 1920, 1928, 1929, 1936 and 1939. This continues to this day.
Mr. Simpson writes about Hamas proposing an "initial 10-year truce with Israel" if it withdraws from the land it seized in 1967. Mr. Simpson does not know that in 1967 Egypt, Syria and Jordan started the 1967 war to destroy Israel. Israel defeated these Arab countries. Israel's enemies started wars in 1948, 1967 and 1973 and lost them all. Since when do losers dictate terms?
U.S. News says: "The peace process is difficult enough without Carter's lies. He says U.N. Resolution 242 specifies an Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 border. It does not." I suggest Dan Simpson see the U.S. News & World Report piece. The contents are quite different from Mr. Simpson's long anti-Israel article and his usual anti-Israel stance.
