To the Editor:
Re ''Spying on Law-Abiding Muslims'' (editorial, Feb. 10):
Investigating international terrorism and analyzing the real threats posed to New York City are enormously complicated undertakings. Any proper critique of the New York Police Department's efforts requires careful analysis and a balanced appreciation of the facts.
The Police Department has not yet responded to the motion filed by class counsel in the lawsuit challenging surveillance techniques. Your readers would have been better served had you waited for that response before alleging that the department has ''simply ignored'' court guidelines and is ''targeting Muslim groups because of their religious affiliation.'' Impartial judges wait to hear from both sides before deciding.
The Police Department has adapted itself to combat the dangers of today, not ghosts from the past. The city has learned through the hard lessons of repeated terrorist attacks, including two attacks on the World Trade Center, and repeated attempts to bomb the subways and other landmarks that there are people dedicated to causing mass murder of its citizens and visitors. Just last week, Quazi Mohammad Rezwanul Ahsan Nafis pleaded guilty to terrorism charges related to his attempt to blow up the Federal Reserve Bank in Manhattan.
The Police Department is doing its utmost to protect the city from the clear, present and potentially huge danger of terrorism, while honoring the timeless freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution.
