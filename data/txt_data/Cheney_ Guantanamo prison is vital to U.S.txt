Vice President Dick Cheney strongly defended the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay on Monday, saying that it was essential to the administration's efforts to combat terrorism.
Cheney also said that detainees there had been treated better by the United States than they could expect to be treated "by virtually any other government on the face of the earth."

To bolster his remarks, made in a speech at the National Press Club, the vice president added to the administration's previous warnings about the dangers of moving too quickly to free more than 500 prisoners held there. Cheney provided new details about what he said had been at least 10 released detainees who had turned up on the battlefield to try to kill U.S. troops.
If the United States were to release all of those held at Guantanamo , the vice president said, that would amount to "putting a lot of bad guys back on the street."

U.N. NUCLEAR AGENCY: Mohammed ElBaradei won a third term Monday as head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency in Vienna and said he was "grateful to the United States" after the Bush administration last week publicly dropped its opposition to him. ElBaradei, a 62-year-old Egyptian diplomat, said his priorities will include fighting the threat of nuclear proliferation and the potential menace posed by nuclear terrorism - issues on which he said he has full U.S. support.
