HONOLULU - President Barack Obama said the United States is reviewing whether to put North Korea back on its list of state sponsors of terrorism as Washington decides how to respond to what he calls an "act of cybervandalism," not one of war, against a movie company.
Sony Pictures Entertainment, which said it canceled the theatrical release of "The Interview" after distributors refused to show it, pledged to find a way to get the film out. "How it`s going to be distributed, I don`t think anybody knows quite yet," a Sony lawyer said. The comedy involves a plot to assassinate North Korea`s leader.
Obama is promising to respond "proportionately" to an attack that law enforcement blames on North Korea. "We`re not going to be intimidated by some cyberhackers," he said.
The president said the U.S. would examine the facts to determine whether North Korea should land back on the terrorism sponsors list.
"We`re going to review those through a process that`s already in place," Obama told CNN`s "State of the Union" in an interview broadcast Sunday. "I`ll wait to review what the findings are."
While raising the possibility of a terrorism designation, Obama also asserted, "I don`t think it was an act of war. I think it was an act of cybervandalism that was very costly, very expensive. We take it very seriously."
Meanwhile, a long statement from North Korea`s National Defense Commission said Sunday that Obama is "recklessly" spreading rumors of a Pyongyang-orchestrated cyberattack, and it warned of strikes against the White House, Pentagon and "the whole U.S. mainland, that cesspool of terrorism."
