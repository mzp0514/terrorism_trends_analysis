The language used in the debate over illegal immigration is getting pretty rough out there.
Tom Crawford of capitolimpact.com has a piece, available at Atlanta Magazine, in which 10th District congressional candidate Jim Whitehead of Evans, a Republican, explains why he's leaning on illegal immigration as an issue, rather than the war in the Middle East.
Writes Crawford:
"Iraq has not been a big thing in our district," said Whitehead, a former University of Georgia offensive lineman. "Immigration is the No. 1 issue, pure and simple." Whitehead contends that "left-wing political activists [are] intentionally registering illegal aliens to vote, including known Al Qaeda terrorists.... This is a pivotal issue for the future of America. We have to have the intestinal fortitude to protect all Americans."
Don't dismiss this as a stray stab of hyperbole. D.A. King, the illegal immigration activist who supports Whitehead, allegedly said much the same thing at an April 28 meeting of the Newton County Republican party.
"They're not here to mow your lawn --- they're here to blow up your buildings and kill your children, and you, and me," King was quoted as saying.
Jerry Gonzalez, executive director of of the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials, has been berating GOP officials in attendance, urging them to put distance between themselves and King's remarks. Without much luck.
