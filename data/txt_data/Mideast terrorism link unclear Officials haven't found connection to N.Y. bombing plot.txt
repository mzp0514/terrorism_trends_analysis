NEW YORK - Three days of "very intensive" investigations failed to
establish a direct link between two men accused of plotting a suicide
bombing on the subway and terrorist activities in Israel, a top
official said.
The FBI, New York police and international intelligence agencies are
working to determine any connections between the suspects and Middle
Eastern militants, Sandy Berger, President Clinton's national security
adviser, said Sunday on CBS' "Face the Nation."
Gazi Ibrahim Abu Mezer, 23, and Lafi Khalil, 22, were captured
Thursday during an early-morning police raid on their Brooklyn
apartment. Authorities said they were hours away from attempting a
suicide bombing at a busy Brooklyn subway station.
The raid came the day after bombs killed 15 people in Jerusalem's main
produce market. Palestinian militants had threatened to carry out more
attacks unless Israel released Islamic activists from prison.
Berger said investigators so far "have not established any direct
relationship" between the Brooklyn plot and any wider conspiracy.
The Mideast terror group Hamas claimed responsibility for the
Jerusalem bombings, but on Saturday denied "any relationship between
us and those who were detained" in Brooklyn.
A day earlier, a federal law enforcement source in Washington told the
AP that both suspects were linked to Hamas. But James Kallstrom, chief
of the New York FBI office, said it "is totally wrong to say that
these individuals are connected to and directed by Hamas."
