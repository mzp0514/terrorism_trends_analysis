A Moroccan student charged with aiding the Hamburg terrorist cell involved in the September 11 attacks admitted yesterday he trained in an Osama bin Laden camp in Afghanistan but denied knowing about the plot against America.
Mounir el Motassadeq, 28, is the first person to go on trial in connection with the suicide hijackings that killed thousands in New York, at the Pentagon, and in a field in Pennsylvania.
Mr. El Motassadeq testified that he learned to fire a Kalashnikov assault rifle at the camp during three weeks of training in mid-2000 but was unaware it was run by Mr. bin Laden's Al Qaeda organization until he got there.
"I learned that bin Laden was responsible for the camp and had been at the camp sometimes," he said. But, he added, "I didn't know that beforehand and I didn't meet him either."
Mr. El Motassadeq, in custody since his arrest in Hamburg two months after the attacks, faces a possible life sentence if convicted of membership in a terrorist organization and more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder.
His attorneys told the court he is innocent and denies prosecutors' charges that he provided logistical support to the Hamburg cell, which included hijacker Mohamed Atta and two of the other pilots.
