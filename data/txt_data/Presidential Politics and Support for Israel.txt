  Re ''No Manchurian Candidate,'' by Roger Cohen (column, The New York Times on the Web, Feb. 11):
  If only the United States would show some resolve and pressure its ally Israel into concessions then the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would be solved. And Barack Obama is just the guy to do it. That seems to be the sentiment behind Mr. Cohen's column.
  That sentiment, though, smacks up against reality. Israel offered essentially all of the West Bank for a Palestinian state in the Camp David talks of 2000, and actually ceded all of Gaza. In return, the Israelis have received rockets and terrorism.
  What's really needed is pressure, but not from the United States. Peace-seeking Palestinians need to pressure and eliminate the terrorist elements from their midst. Until then, Israel must defend its citizens, as would any other nation.

  To the Editor:
  I would advise against making the assumption that Israel-related issues are the be-all and end-all for Jewish-American voters. 
  Health care, Iraq, terrorism, the economy, Darfur, illegal immigration -- why presume that American Jews across the United States, and of all age demographics, are going to set aside these issues and make their choice on who should be the next president based solely on who will be ''good for Israel''?
  Will all African-Americans vote for Barack Obama, all women for Hillary Rodham Clinton and all evangelical Christians for Mike Huckabee? 
  Maybe tribal politics are indeed the case, but that kind of assumption sells American Jewish voters short.
