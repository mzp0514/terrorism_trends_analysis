To the Editor:
In his testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig accused the Soviet Union of being responsible for ''international terrorism,'' of having a ''hit list'' for domination of Central America and of posing ''the most serious threat to world peace that we're facing'' (news story March 19).
As a concerned American citizen, naturally I am alarmed at the sudden upsurge of terrorism, and I agree with Mr. Haig that the Soviets are perhaps responsible for a good deal of these events.
William Laurence letter urges Secretary of State Alexander Haig to stop verbally insulting Soviet Union
However, I must disagree with Mr. Haig's allegation that the Soviet Union poses the ''most serious threat to world peace.'' A far more serious threat to world peace exists right here in America, and that is Mr. Haig's constantly open mouth. In order to maintain world peace, the United States must stop insulting the Soviet Union.
The only way that the United States can maintain peaceful relations with the Soviet Union is to take the initiative and adopt a policy of diplomacy and tact with regard to foreign affairs. Because of the tenuous nature of our relations with the Soviet Union, care must be taken to insure our national security. These constant barbs that Mr.  Haig keeps throwing at the Soviet Union couldn't be helping.
