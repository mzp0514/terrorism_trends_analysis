THE JETBLUE pilot who went berserk on a Las Vegas-bound flight kept both feet on the ground Monday when he made his first court appearance.
Clayton Osbon made no religious rants or tirades about terrorism as he stood before a federal judge in Amarillo, Texas.
"Do you understand what they say you did?" U.S. Magistrate Judge Clinton Averitte asked.
"Yes," said the 49-year-old pilot, who was dressed in a light green dress shirt, darker green pants and silver-plated handcuffs.
Osbon winked at his wife, Connye, but frowned through much of the rest of the five-minute proceeding. He did not enter a plea before he was taken back to a lockup. He is due back in court Thursday for a detention hearing.
Osbon is charged with interfering with a flight crew for his bizarre unraveling on Flight 191 last Tuesday. He faces up to 20 years in prison.
The veteran pilot suddenly started turning off instruments while ranting about Jesus, 9/11 and terrorists shortly after JetBlue Flight 191 took off from Kennedy Airport.
Luckily, the plane was packed with burly New Yorkers headed to a security convention in Las Vegas. Several jumped the captain and kept him tied up on the floor until the plane could make an emergency landing in Texas.
