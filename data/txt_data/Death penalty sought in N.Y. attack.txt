 NEW YORK  - A man charged with using a truck to kill eight people last year on a New York City bike path will face the death penalty at a trial next year, federal prosecutors said Friday.
 The government filing said the case against Sayfullo Saipov met several legal standards for a capital case, including premeditation to commit terrorism and the "heinous, cruel and depraved manner" in which the victims were slaughtered.
 In a statement, defense attorney David Patten said he was disappointed that the Justice Department signed off on seeking the death penalty.
 "We think the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accepting a guilty plea to life in prison with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved," Patten said.
CBS subpoenaed on Moonves allegations
 NEW YORK  - CBS said Friday that a New York City prosecutor has subpoenaed the company for information related to sexual misconduct allegations that led to the ouster of longtime chief Les Moonves.
 The company said in a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it received subpoenas from the Manhattan District Attorney and New York City's Commission on Human Rights and is cooperating.
 The state attorney general's office has also requested information, the filing said.
 Moonves resigned as chairman of CBS on Sept. 9, hours after The New Yorker published a story detailing a second round of ugly accusations against him.
 In total, a dozen women have alleged mistreatment, including forced oral sex, groping and retaliation if they resisted him.
 Moonves has denied the allegations, though he said he had consensual relations with some of the women.
