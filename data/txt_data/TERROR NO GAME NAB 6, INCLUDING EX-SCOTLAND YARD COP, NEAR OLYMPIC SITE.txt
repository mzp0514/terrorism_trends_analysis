IN LIGHTNING predawn raids across London, anti-terrorism cops arrested six people, including a former Scotland Yard patrol officer nabbed in the shadow of Olympic Park.
Police in black masks set off smoke grenades before bursting into homes Wednesday morning and grabbing members of a suspected terror cell.
Authorities insisted there was no evidence of a plot against the Olympics, though they're on high alert as the July 27 start of the Summer Games approaches.
The British Army also closed a highway for hours Wednesday after someone on a London-bound bus reported seeing "vapor" - which turned out to be from an electronic cigarette.
The five men and one woman arrested in the London raids are British Muslims, an activist said.
Newspapers identified one as Richard Dart, a Christian-raised Muslim convert who says soldiers returning from Afghanistan are murderers.
Three were brothers of Bangladeshi descent. One of them had worked for Scotland Yard from 2007 to 2009 as a support officer who patrols the streets but cannot arrest anyone.
Dart was picked up on the street.
The former security guard from Dorset, who calls himself Salahuddin, was the subject of a BBC documentary shot by his stepbrother, who was shocked by his radicalization after seeing him for the first time in years .
"Some of the first words he said were, 'Look at these filthy Kuffar (non-believers). None of this will be around when Sharia law comes in," the stepbrother, Robb Leech, told the website IdeasTap.
