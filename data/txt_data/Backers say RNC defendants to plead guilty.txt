Four remaining defendants of a group of protesters known as the RNC8 will plead guilty to reduced charges Tuesday in Ramsey County District Court, supporters of the group said in a news release Friday.
The defendants were charged with felonies for organizing disruptive actions during the Republican National Convention in St. Paul in September 2008.
The Ramsey County Attorney's office said a pretrial hearing was scheduled but declined to discuss its nature. Jordan Kushner, one defendant's lawyer, also declined comment.
The news release, issued by the group's defense committee, said supporters would pack the courtroom Tuesday "to ensure favorable sentencing" for Rob Czernik, Garrett Fitzgerald, Nathanael Secor and Max Specktor.
Melissa Hill of the group's defense committee said the prosecution "was an attempt to criminalize dissent," and she thanked supporters for backing the protesters "through this legal ordeal," according to the release.
Paul Gustafson, spokesman for County Attorney Susan Gaertner, said only, "The attorneys in the case have had discussions. There is a hearing scheduled for Tuesday morning at 9 o'clock." He said a trial is set for Oct. 25.
Eight activists were charged with terrorism, first-degree conspiracy to commit damage to property and second-degree conspiracy to commit riot.
The charge of committing the actions "in furtherance of terrorism" was dropped in April 2009. Erik Oseland, one of the defendants, pleaded guilty in August to a gross-misdemeanor charge of conspiracy to commit criminal damage to property. In September, the county attorney's office dropped all charges against three defendants.
