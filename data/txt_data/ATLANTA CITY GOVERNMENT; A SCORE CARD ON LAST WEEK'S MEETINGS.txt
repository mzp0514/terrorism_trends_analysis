Monday's Atlanta City Council
Next meeting: May 16
Action: Accepted more than $1 million to combat domestic terrorism. The council authorized Mayor Shirley Franklin to accept $800,000 in federal funds for undisclosed "security measures" at about 16 sites around the city.
The council also authorized receiving computers and software from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation worth $269,100, plus $25,000 for supplies. The equipment will be used for "accumulating criminal intelligence" and sharing it.
Vote: 14-0
What it means for you: The $800,000 in U.S. Department of Homeland Security funds will be used to "identify vulnerabilities" at potential terrorist targets and to recommend defensive measures. The other funding will allow the Atlanta Police Department to exchange information about terrorism suspects with state police and other participating agencies.
Action: Authorized the sale and consumption of alcohol at bars and restaurants after midnight on June 26.
Vote: 14-0
What it means for you: Alcohol sales for on-premises consumption normally must end at midnight on Sundays, but this one-time extension allows sales until 2:30 a.m. the following Monday.
Action: Authorized paying the Fulton County Board of Registration and Elections up to $1.45 million to conduct city elections Nov. 8, and any runoff election.
Vote: 15-0
What it means for you: Fulton County poll workers will count ballots cast in the upcoming city general election, when voters will select a mayor, a city council and a school board.
