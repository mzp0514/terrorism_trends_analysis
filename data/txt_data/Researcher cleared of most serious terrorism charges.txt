LUBBOCK, Texas -- A world-renowned plague researcher was cleared Monday of the most serious charges he faced related to a bioterrorism scare triggered when he reported plague samples missing from his Texas Tech University lab.
Dr. Thomas Butler, was convicted of 47 charges, but most of them stemmed from an investigation entirely separate from the plague scare.
The jury acquitted Butler of 22 charges accusing him of smuggling and illegally transporting the potentially deadly germ, as well as lying to federal agents.
Butler, 62, appeared stunned as the verdicts were read after two days of deliberations.
The charges stemmed from his report to police Jan. 14 that 30 vials of the potentially deadly plague bacteria were missing from his lab. FBI agents rushed to Lubbock to investigate the scare, and President Bush was briefed about the incident.
In a statement written later, Butler said he accidentally destroyed the samples. However, during his trial he testified that he had no clear memory of destroying the vials but that they could have been destroyed during his cleanup of an accident.
The jury also cleared him of smuggling plague samples into the United States in April 2002 and illegally transporting them to federal facilities.
Butler was found guilty of 44 theft, embezzlement, fraud, and mail and wire fraud charges pertaining to shadow contracts prosecutors claimed he had illegally negotiated with pharmaceutical companies with which he also had clinical studies contracts.
