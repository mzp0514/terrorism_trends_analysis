May 29--NATCHEZ -- The two candidates running in the June 5 Democratic Party primary for the U.S. House of Representatives Third Congressional District seat will travel to Natchez on Wednesday to answer questions and meet constituents.
The Adams County Democratic Executive Committee invited candidates Michael Aycox and Michael Evans to speak at 11 a.m. Wednesday at the Natchez Coffee Company.
"These two have shown interest in Natchez," said Gwen Ball, a member cCommittee. "I think what would be nice is if people express their ideas as to how they would like to see these candidates present themselves both to the state and to the nation."
Aycox is a former police officer and anti-terrorism specialist for the United States Navy and the state's first openly gay candidate for Congress.
Evans has been a Mississippi representative for District 45 since 2012 and has lived and worked in Mississippi his whole life.
Democratic candidates Aycox and Evans will answer questions from the crowd, join in a lunch at the coffee shop and make presentations of their policy platforms and goals.
"(Attendees) will be able to understand who these two people are," Ball said," and how their policy stances have been shaped."
