To the Editor:
''Pinochet vs. the Hippocratic Oath'' by Cesar A. Chelala (Op-Ed, Jan 6) is not only inaccurate and misleading, but it also induces the reader to make wrong judgments about situations that are clear and precise with respect to current conditions in Chile and the independence and honesty of Chilean courts.
Mr. Chelala does not mention that Hugo Gomez has a record of having participated in terrorist acts.
Indeed, he was wounded during an ambush in which a terrorist group he was leading killed a police officer. Nor does he mention that he was treated for his wounds by members of the Vicaria de la Solidaridad, which did not then inform the police, as required by law. Hence, Dr. Juan Macaya, Dr. Ramiro Olivares and Gustavo Villalobos, a Vicaria lawyer, are not accused of providing medical attention to Mr. Gomez but of withholding information as to his whereabouts.
The requirement to report such treatment is common to many countries to prevent the escape of individuals who commit violent crimes. The Hippocratic Oath can't be used as a subterfuge to shield terrorists from the law. The Chilean courts, independent of the Government, are simply applying the law.
Chile, so long as it acts within the law, has the right to defend its people from the grave threat of terrorism. To deny itself that right would be irresponsibility on a historic scale. It would not only be a blow to the legitimate aspirations of the majority to live in peace, but would also facilitate the way of those who, through continued violence, are attempting to seize power.
