WASHINGTON (AP) - A Palestinian who authorities say was second-in-command of a violent terrorist group will remain in jail pending trial for a fatal 1982 bombing of an American jetliner, a federal judge ruled Monday.
A federal prosecutor argued that Mohammed Rashid is dangerous and skilled in eluding law enforcement, noting he once escaped from a Turkish prison and has used fake passports from several countries.
"He has no ties to this country" and would likely flee overseas if released, Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Walutes said during a brief hearing before U.S. District Judge Aubrey Robinson.
Rashid, 51, was whisked out of Egypt earlier this month and brought to Washington to face terrorism charges. He pleaded innocent June 3 in a bombing that killed a 16-year-old Japanese boy and injured 15 other passengers on an international Pan Am flight in August 1982.
An 11-year-old U.S. indictment contends Rashid and his wife planted a bomb under a seat cushion on the Boeing 747. The couple, with their young child in tow, set the timer to explode on a flight from Japan to Hawaii and then got off the plane in Tokyo.
The explosion tore a 3-foot hole in the jet's cabin, Walutes said. If the bomb had been placed elsewhere, he said, "The entire plane could have come down over the Pacific."
