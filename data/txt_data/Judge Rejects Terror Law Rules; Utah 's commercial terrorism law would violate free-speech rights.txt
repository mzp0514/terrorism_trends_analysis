Efforts by state attorneys to defend a new commercial terrorism law failed Wednesday, when a federal judge sided with opponents who claimed the restrictions on picketing and public demonstrations were unconstitutional.
The Utah Animal Rights Coalition, aided by the American Civil Liberties Union [ACLU], sued the state over the law, which had been passed by the Utah Legislature earlier this year.
It prohibited picketers from emitting light rays or sound waves that might enter a business.
The plaintiffs earlier won a preliminary injunction, which halted it from going into effect on May 1.
After hearing arguments Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Bruce Jenkins ruled the law was unconstitutional.
The biggest flaw with the law, Jenkins said, was that it was overly broad and vague.
It did not specifically define what level of noise or light would violate the law.
Those restrictions, the ACLU and its allies successfully argued, violated the First Amendment right of free speech because they could have potentially criminalized behavior by any protestors who spoke or held signs in front of a business.
Sean Diener, executive director of Utah's Animal Rights Coalition, said that the now-defunct law had hindered his group's recruiting efforts because many prospects feared they would be arrested, even for peaceful protests. Now, however, he expects the group to return to business as usual.
Said Diener: "It will be really effective in creating confidence for demonstrations during the Olympics."
