COLUMBIA University has a reputation for welcoming messengers of hate. Here's a look at some of them:
. In October 2006, students stormed the stage at Roone Arledge Auditorium when Jim Gilchrist, head of the Minutemen Project, an anti-immigration vigilante group, began to speak. Gilchrist's speech was cut short when demonstrators jeered and knocked over furniture.
. In March 2006, contentious Israel basher Norman Finkelstein provoked fury among Jewish students from the same stage. "The only difference between Israeli and Hamas terrorism is that Israeli terrorism, judging by the numbers, is three times as lethal," he said as pro-Israel students raised placards saying the DePaul University professor supported Hezbollah.
. Also in October 2006, a trio of controversial speakers spoke at the same campus event. Walid Shoebat, an ex-Palestine Liberation Organization terrorist; Zak Anani, the one-time leader of a vicious Lebanese gang, and former Nazi Hilmar von Campe all shared the same stage.
. Back in the 1930s, school President Nicholas Murray Butler even hosted one of Adolf Hitler's cronies. Nazi ambassador Hans Luther was invited to speak on campus in December 1933, triggering a student revolt. Butler fanned the fury by throwing a cocktail reception for Luther.
