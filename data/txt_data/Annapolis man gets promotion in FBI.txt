BALTIMORE (AP) - The head of the FBI's Baltimore office has been promoted to the agency's third-highest anti-terrorism post at headquarters in Washington.
Gary M. Bald, of Annapolis, who has led Baltimore's office for the past 14 months, began his position as inspector-deputy assistant director yesterday.
The 26-year FBI veteran is in charge of international and domestic anti-terrorism operations in the agency's counterterrorism division.
"It's one of those things when the director calls, you're here," said Mr. Bald, who was appointed Thursday. "I've thoroughly enjoyed being in Baltimore and would be happy still being there today."
Mr. Bald's short tenure in Baltimore began when, four days into the assignment, he joined a team of law enforcement officers investigating the Washington-area sniper shootings.
Mr. Bald, 49, directed the team of FBI agents who arrested sniper suspects John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo sleeping in their car at a Maryland Interstate rest stop.
After that, Mr. Bald shifted the office's criminal focus toward anti-terrorism as the FBI's mission changed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. He restructured the joint terrorism task force in Baltimore by adding more supervisors, including two state police lieutenants, to improve intelligence and strengthen a threat response team.
The next special agent in charge at the Baltimore office, which oversees investigations in Maryland and Delaware, will be the eighth in 13 years.
