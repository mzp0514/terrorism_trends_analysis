An anti-terrorism specialist in the Air Force was sworn in Monday as Collinsville's new police chief.
Friend Walker, 50, will replace Gerritt Gillespie, who retired Oct. 1.
William Pierce, a former assistant superintendent of the Illinois State Police, has been serving as interim police chief.
Walker will be paid about $75,000 a year to lead the 39-officer department.
"I want to meet with community groups and community leaders to determine what they want to see happen in the department and what to focus on," Walker said.
Mayor Stan Schaeffer said Walker's military experience will help make him a good leader for the police department.
Until about two weeks ago, Walker served as vice commander of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, Region 3, at Scott Air Force Base.
Walker, a lieutenant colonel, was second in command of about a 400-member staff. He has worked in federal law enforcement and intelligence, including investigations, anti-terrorism and counterintelligence.
Walker led the Air Force's part of the investigation of the terrorist attack on the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001, and reported on terrorism in Turkey.
[Even though Walker retired from the Air Force June 11, his official last day with the service won't be until Aug. 1. Walker said he had built up vacation time and other leave days during his nearly 26 years in the Air Force.
