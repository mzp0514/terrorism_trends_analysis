<k20f"BodoniStd">Jokes have been made about Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff’s "gut feeling" that the United States is facing a high risk for another terrorist attack. 
But the risk of terrorism is no joke. 
Many experts reviewing intelligence reports and recent events have reached similar conclusions. 
A "senior U.S. intelligence official" was quoted in the New York Daily News as saying, "What you’ve been seeing has a feeling, to me, a lot like the summer of 2001." The official added, "It would not surprise me at all to see another terrorist event this summer in the United States." 
There is no specific threat outlined, just a number of factors coming together - in other words, a "gut feeling." 
It’s understandable that Americans might brush off such vague warnings. 
We have seen "threats" come and go without a major attack. We have learned to accept taking off our shoes and putting small containers of toiletries in plastic bags while going through airport security. 
We have heeded the call to live our lives normally, to continue to travel, etc. 
But we also must heed the call to remain vigilant, to report suspicious activity and recognize the need for enhanced security measures, despite the inconvenience. 
As national security adviser Stephen Hadley reminds us, "the struggle against terrorism is going to be with us for a long time."
