The Soviet delegate to the United Nations said today that Nicaragua's harbors were being mined by ''terrorists, supported, equipped and financed by the United States'' in what he called a ''new chapter of international terrorism.''
The delegate, Oleg A. Troyanovsky, also said at a news conference that the Soviet Union and the United States were in ''one of the darkest periods'' in their relations and that an early summit meeting would be counterproductive.
Soviet delegate to UN Oleg A Troyanovsky says Nicaragua's harbors are being mined by 'terrorists, supported, equipped and financed' by US; says US move to block action by World Court on Nicaraguan complaint shows 'inconsistency' of US policy (S)
He said the United States' move to block action by the International Court of Justice on Nicaragua's complaint about American actions showed the ''inconsistency'' of American policy.
The United States, calling Nicaragua's suit a ''propaganda exercise,'' told the court Tuesday that it would reject any attempt to rule on the case.
''Ever since the World Court was set up, the United States has been keen on making the point that it recognizes its compulsory jurisdiction,'' Mr. Troyanovsky said. ''But in this case, it realizes that it may lose the case.''
