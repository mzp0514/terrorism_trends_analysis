WASHINGTON (AP) -- Airports lifted parking bans and ended car inspections Sunday after federal officials relaxed the tight security in place since the New York terrorism convictions of militant Muslims.
Other security measures begun in August and intensified in October will continue, however, said Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Sandra Allen.
ASSOCIATED PRESSThose include checking travelers' identification.
The changes come just in time for the busy Thanksgiving and Christmas travel season, but Allen insisted that did not influence federal officials' decision. She would not say what prompted the change.
"We are constantly monitoring the threat potential, and we came to the conclusion these modifications were warranted," she said.
When security was first tightened in early August, the Newsday newspaper reported the FBI had received information that two militant Muslim groups were planning a suicide attack on a New York airport.
On Oct. 1, security was tightened even more, to the highest levels since the Persian Gulf War, on the same day a group of militant Muslims were found guilty of terrorism.
A Clinton administration official said at the time that the alert was related to the terrorism convictions, the signing of a Mideast treaty, the pope's visit and the United Nations' 50th anniversary celebration.
At Dallas-Fort Worth Airport on Sunday, officials reopened about 1,400 one-hour parking spaces near a terminal.
At Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport and at New York's airports, officials halted their inspections of large vehicles as they entered parking garages near terminals.
