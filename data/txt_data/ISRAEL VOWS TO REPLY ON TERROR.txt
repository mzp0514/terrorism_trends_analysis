The Israeli Cabinet secretary, speaking after the Cabinet met to review last week's hijacking of a civilian bus by Palestinian guerrillas, said today that Israel would respond ''appropriately'' to any future terrorist attacks,
After the meeting, some officials said Israel held the Syrian Government responsible for the recent increase in terrorism against Israelis.
The Cabinet secretary, Dan Meridor, did not mention Syria by name in his statement.
''The Government is watching, as always, the actions of the terrorists, their intentions, the assistance they receive and it will respond appropriately,'' Mr. Meridor said. ''I don't want to get into more details on this subject.''
Israel submitted a complaint to the United Nations Saturday, charging that Damascus, whose troops face Israel's in the Bekaa, the valley region of eastern Lebanon, had succeeded Beirut as a center of world terrorism.
The newspaper Davar today published an interview with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in which he referred to a recent Soviet warning to Israel not to attack Syria. Mr. Shamir was quoted as saying, ''They did not mention the Bekaa.''
''I see the warnings voiced toward Israel as Syrian nervousness,'' Mr. Shamir was quoted as saying. ''There is apparently some fear there of an Israeli attack, but the Soviets know that we are not preparing any attack on Syria, and these warnings are apparently coming at the request of the Syrian authorities.''
