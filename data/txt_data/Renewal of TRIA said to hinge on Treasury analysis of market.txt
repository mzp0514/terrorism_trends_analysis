WASHINGTON-The House of Representatives is unlikely to move on reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act until the Treasury Department issues a report on the state of the terrorism insurance market, according to a member of the House Financial Services Committee.
Rep. Deborah Pryce, R-Ohio, offered that assessment at a legislative meeting sponsored by the Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers and the Reinsurance Assn. of America in Washington on Thursday.
Under TRIA, which provides a federal backstop to help private insurers pay for future catastrophic terrorism losses, the Treasury Department has until June 30 to issue its report. TRIA is scheduled to expire Dec. 31, and risk managers, insurers, reinsurers, brokers and others have urged that the program be extended for two years early in this congressional session to help prevent possible market disruptions.
Rep. Richard Baker, R-La., chairman of the Financial Services Committee's Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance and Government Sponsored Enterprises, told the gathering he has heard the Senate may move soon on TRIA. Rep. Baker-who has been one of TRIA's staunchest supporters-warned that some members of the House leadership ''just don't like'' TRIA. He said those members recall their bad experience in providing financial guarantees for the U.S. airline industry in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York and elsewhere.
Rep. Baker said TRIA must strike a balance that would keep the insurance industry functioning after a major terrorist attack but allow the Treasury Department to recoup its advances to the industry when insurers returned to financial health.
