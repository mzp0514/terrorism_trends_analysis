THE THREAT of terrorism is alive and very real, and major U.S. cities must remain on guard.
That was the message coming loud and clear from New York's senators yesterday in the wake of the latest attempted terrorist attack in London.
"This again shows that terrorism is everywhere and we here in New York and around the world need to remain vigilant," Sen. Chuck Schumer said.
"It also shows that the threat of homegrown terrorism is undoubtedly on the rise."
As security around the U.S. was cranked up following the discovery of two cars loaded with gasoline and nails, New Yorkers were once again reminded of their vulnerability in the face of those determined to wreak havoc. Police patrols were increased across the country and Sen. Hillary Clinton urged residents to be on the lookout for anything suspicious.
"Today's news reminds us that we must remain vigilant and direct our limited homeland security resources to the most vulnerable areas of our country," she said.
"It's important to remain steadfast here and abroad and not become complacent when it comes to our homeland security."
Despite the increased police presence, the White House said there were no immediate plans to raise the U.S. national threat level, which is currently at yellow.
"There is no specific or credible evidence of any threat of any kind against the United States of America . . . nor are we changing the terror alert," said White House press secretary Tony Snow.
