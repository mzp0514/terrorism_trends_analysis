You can have your Army khaki,        You can keep your Navy blue;
 
     For there's another fighting man        I'll introduce to you.
 

 
   That's the beginning of an old barracks ballad we sang in boot camp    many years ago. It was sung to the tune of Ghost Riders in the Sky.
 

 
 
 
   His uniform is spotless,        The best you've ever seen        The Germans called him Devil-Dog        His real name is Marine.
 
   This week as I was scraping dead paint off a neighbor's house in    preparation for painting it, I was having a pretty good day. I had my    old beat-up "work radio" tuned to Public Radio, listening to opera    music as I worked. I do this for two reasons. First, I like the music    and find it calming. Second, I have found that as long as I have that    type of music playing loudly most folks don't hang around and pester me    while I work. I do the kind of work I do for the solitude it affords    me. Working alone and undisturbed at menial tasks, I am able to think    about subjects on which I wish to write.
 
     After a particularly hard section I stopped scraping to rest and    reflect on the job so far. It was then that the news broke that the    scum who had been holding Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins had killed    him. I sank to the ground in shock and anger.
 
     After a time, I got up and climbed back on the ladder and began    scraping as hard as I could until the tears of anguish made it    impossible to see what I was doing. I stopped, went home, and lowered    my flag to half-staff. I saluted the colors and sat in the grass and    thought about brotherhood; the kind of brotherhood that one Marine    feels for another - a brotherhood born of training and tradition.
 
 
    He comes from Parris Island,        The land that God forgot,        Where the mud is 14 inches thick        The sun is scorching hot.
 
     He's peeled a million onions,        And twice as many spuds,        Spends all his free time squaring away his duds.
 
 
 
 
   I never had the honor of knowing this man personally, but he had    been in my thoughts every day since his abduction Feb. 17, 1988.
 
     He was of that generation of young officers who led men like me in    the field in Vietnam. He was one of the "few good men" who chose a    life of service to his country and stayed in the corps after the war.
 
 He was part of the U.N. Peacekeeping forces in that troubled part of    the world when taken, unarmed, by the forces of the Hezbollah.
 
 
    His rifle is his best friend,        It never leaves his side,        And he shoots it with a deadly aim,        That cannot be denied.
 
     And on that battlefield you'll hear his warlike cry,     
 Come on Leathernecks,        We'll fight 'em 'til we die.
 

 
    Col. Higgins now takes his place at the head of a column of men    b b that stretches all the way back to the Revolutionary War. It is a    column of good men, whose deaths in defense of other people's freedoms    demand remembrance and respect. They were the best we had; the red    stripes on our flag are dyed a much deeper hue by their blood.
 
     The time has come for all right-thinking people on this planet to    understand that we are at war. If we have become too civilized to deal    effectively with terrorism and its supporters, than civilization is    lost. To those who lamely state that we can't lower ourselves to    "their level," I say, "It's the only level we have." Rise up. Take    action. We must rid ourselves of this scourge, as a simple matter of    planetary hygiene. Those who do nothing to fight this cancer bear the    blame. It is men like Lt. Col. Higgins who bear the cost.
 
     So Lady, here's a tip I'll gladly give to you,        Find yourself a good Marine,        There's nothing he can't do.
 
     And when he gets to heaven,        St. Peter he will tell,        "Just another Marine reporting, sir,        God knows I've served my time in hell."
 
  M.Y. Keith is a Vietnam veteran who lives in St. Petersburg.
