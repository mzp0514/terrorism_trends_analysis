UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The Security Council's sanctions against Libya include an air embargo, a ban on all weapons trade and expulsion of Libyan diplomats.  The council also demands an end to Libyan-sponsored terrorism.
A U.N. resolution says all states shall take the following steps until Libya turns over suspects in the bombings of Pan Am Flight 103 and French UTA Flight 772: AIR EMBARGO All nations must prohibit aircraft from using their territory or airspace on its way to or from Libya, unless it carries humanitarian supplies approved by a U.N. committee.  All states also must prohibit the supply of aircraft or aircraft components to Libya.  ARMS EMBARGO All states must prohibit providing weapons, ammunition and military equipment of all types to Libya.  They also must not provide military technical advice or training, and withdraw any officials or agents now in Libya for those purposes.  DIPLOMATIC STAFF All states must ''significantly reduce'' their diplomatic staffs at Libyan diplomatic missions and consular posts, restrict the movement of Libyan staff members on their territory and shut down all Libyan Arab Airlines offices.  They must also expel or deny entry to Libyan nationals who have been expelled from or denied entry to other states because of terrorist activities.  TERRORISM Libya must cease all forms of terrorism and all assistance to terrorist groups and swiftly demonstrate its renunciation of terrorism through concrete actions.
