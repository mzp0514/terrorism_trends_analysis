 What's in a name?
 The Obama administration recently changed the "Global War on Terror" to "Overseas Contingency Operation," thereby inviting consternation not only among conservatives but among those preferring clarity of language and purpose.
 How does a nation order heroes into combat on behalf of a contingency operation?
 Cry havoc!
 The political implications grow murky, alas. During George Bush's second term, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld (for a time a darling of the right) proposed renaming the conflict the "Global Struggle Against Violent Extremism." Bush wisely stuck with Global War on Terror.
 But...
 ... There was a time conservatives called War on Terror a euphemism. Terrorism is a tactic, they explained; it refers to the means the enemy employs. No one called World War II the War Against Blitzkrieg. Moreover, if the U.S. has declared war on terror as terror, then it should be at war not only in Afghanistan and Iraq but in numerous distant corners where terrorism regularly occurs.
 The War Against Islamofacism seems more accurate. Yet although the enemies in that war - al-Qaida and the Taliban, for instance - target other Muslims, a war with Islam in its name runs the risk of alienating countries and peoples the U.S. considers allies, or ought to.
 The Afghanistan War and the Iraq War may be the best we can do. Yet even to engage in a discussion such as this is distasteful and perhaps obscene. Whatever a war's name, war is what Sherman said it was.
