(Skokie, IL) - An Illinois House panel last week approved legislation to authorize a $25 million anti-terrorism program that provide grants to non-profit groups to bolster security at their facilities.
In the wake of bomb threats nationally to Jewish Centers, Jewish schools, including Chicago, and vandalized Jewish cemeteries, House Deputy Majority Leader Lou Lang (D-Skokie) rolled out in early March the legislation, House Bill 4011, that would establish a $25 million grant making program in the Illinois Secretary of State's office to provide financial assistance "on an emergency basis" to Illinois non-profits to blunt or respond to "acts of terrorism" against their facilities.
"In the aftermath of a presidential campaign in which anti-Semitic dog whistles were blown - and tweeted - regularly by Donald Trump, his white supremacist supporters have felt emboldened to lob hoax bomb threats at Jewish institutions," said Lang. "I am unwilling to risk that domestic terrorists will be content with hoax bomb threats; so, that's why I am pushing a fast-track, program to enhance security at non-profit facilities targeted by terrorism."
The House State Government Administration on Wednesday voted 5-2 to advance the plan to the full House.
According to the legislation, the Secretary of State can authorize a grant of any amount based on a detailed threat assessment submitted by non-profit applicants.
Lang expects action on a companion measure, HB 4012, which actually appropriates the $25 million, when the legislature returns to Springfield this week.
