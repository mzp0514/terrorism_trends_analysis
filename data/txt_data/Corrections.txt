NATIONAL
An article on Tuesday about combating domestic terrorism referred incorrectly to the attacks on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. The attack involved a single gunman, not multiple. 
  BUSINESS
  An article on Tuesday about a 1996 law meant to protect young internet companies from liability misidentified the law that protects hate speech. It is the First Amendment, not Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The error was repeated in the headline.
  ARTS
  A picture caption with a critic's notebook on Tuesday about the Mostly Mozart Festival misidentified the composers who were included in the program conducted by Gianandrea Noseda. They were Beethoven and Schubert, not Beethoven and Brahms.
