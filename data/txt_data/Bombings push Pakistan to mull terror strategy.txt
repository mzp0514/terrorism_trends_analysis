LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) - The spread of terrorism across Pakistan on Tuesday from its unruly tribal regions to the cultural capital of Lahore has added to pressure to rethink its U.S.-allied president's approach to countering al-Qaida and the Taliban as a new government prepares to take office.
After two deadly suicide bombings in this normally peaceful eastern city, pressure grew for more dialogue with militants and less punitive military action, which President Pervez Musharraf's opponents say has only fueled the violence.
At least 24 people were killed and more than 200 wounded Tuesday when massive explosions ripped through a police headquarters and a business located near a house belonging to the widower of slain opposition leader Benazir Bhutto.
Musharraf quickly condemned the "savage" bombings and said in a statement the government would continue to fight terrorism "with full force." Authorities have blamed Taliban and al-Qaida militants for a recent surge of bombings.
The winners of last month's elections accused the former army strongman of destabilizing the country with military operations against militants near the Afghan border and even suggested that rogue forces were trying to undermine Pakistan's return to democracy.
