HONOLULU â€¢ The White House says the United States would welcome "closer cooperation" with Russia on security preparations for the Winter Olympics after a pair of deadly attacks that sparked fear about potential terrorism at the February Games.
"The U.S. government has offered our full support to the Russian government in security preparations for the Sochi Olympic Games," White House spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said Monday. "We would welcome the opportunity for closer cooperation for the safety of the athletes, spectators and other participants."
Officials say that while Russia will be responsible for overall security at the Games, U.S. personnel will be in the country in what the U.S. is calling "liaison roles." The effort will be headed by the State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security, which typically assists host nations during events where a large number of Americans will be present.
The State Department urged Americans planning to attend the Olympics to remain alert at all times.
"Major events such as the Olympic games are an opportunity for thieves or for other folks who want to cause mischief," State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. "Threats have been made against the Olympic games, and acts of terrorism, including bombings, continue to occur in Russia."
