More than 10 years after a bomb shattered Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, two Libyan former intelligence agents will go on trial in the Netherlands, under Scottish law, for the act that claimed 270 lives.
A complicated deal worked out over years of negotiations with Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi meets American/British legal preconditions and should be a fair trial.
Investigators reportedly have amassed evidence against the Libyans who will be tried by Scottish judges.
The court first must determine whether the two suspects actually placed the suitcase bomb on the plane at London's Heathrow Airport during a stopover from Frankfurt to New York.
Then the judges will have to face the more difficult but central question of who gave the orders to blow up the plane and why. Prime suspects include the governments of Libya, Syria and Iran - all rogue countries with a deep hatred of the United States.
Some of the victims' relatives are expressing relief a trial will be conducted. But others are voicing dismay at the concessions Gadhafi was able to extract from the West for his "cooperation."
Libya has been given provisional relief from U.N. sanctions against air travel and imports of industrial equipment so vital to its oil production, and from a partial freeze on Libyan assets abroad. Separate U.S. sanctions, however, remain in place.
This is the first international trial to deal with a major act of terrorism.
While determining the guilt or innocence of the accused is the primary goal, the trial should dig deeply into the shadowy world of terrorism and its sponsors.
