U.S. Marines Sgt. Calvin Torres has been named this month's Round Lake Area Exchange Club Hometown Hero.
Torres is a Round Lake Beach resident. He is a 2006 graduate from Round Lake High School, where he played football all four years.
In addition, Torres has tried out for the Marines football team and is stationed at Camp Pendleton in California. He has earned several commendations, such as National Defense and Global War on Terrorism medals.
Hometown Hero Project Chairwoman Sherry Ridge said the Torres family isn't a stranger to the Hometown Hero program. Marine Lance Cpl. Cassondra Leo, a daughter in the Torres family, received the honor this past summer.
Torres will receive a Hanging with the Heroes care package delivered with a personalized T-shirt and letters from Round Lake Area Unit District 116 students. He'll also get chips, crackers and iTunes. The Round Lake Area Exchange Club will present a plaque to him and his family at 7:30 a.m. Wednesday, Oct. 24, at Panera Bread in Round Lake Beach.
Any military personnel serving overseas or in the United States from any of the Round Lake areas, Hainesville, Fox Lake or Ingleside qualify for the program. Nominees may be put forward at rlaexchange.org/hero. For details, call Ridge at (847) 740-2379.
