President Bush in a speech last week made a convincing argument about the progress America is making in Iraq. However, his continued insistence that there is a connection between Iraq and the terrorists who attacked America shows he is ignoring the big picture ("Bush rejects Iraq deadline," News, Thursday).
I agree that we can't just pull out of Iraq. However, in order to effectively protect the United States from terrorism, we need the president to accurately understand and communicate about terrorism and related goals to Americans.

Retreat? No way.
What is the obsession with withdrawal from Iraq? We have yet to withdraw from Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kuwait, South Korea, Japan or Germany.
I would hope that the Iraqis would offer us a permanent base and we would accept. To say that it would not be a surrender or retreat if we withdrew from Iraq under fire is nonsensical. I would like to see construction of a permanent U.S. base in Iraq begin promptly. That, in my view, would let the Iraqis know that we will not abandon them.
Let's show the terrorists the futility of their continued attacks, and keep pressure on Iran and Syria.

Can U.S. rebuild Iraq?
President Bush's stated goal of rebuilding Iraq is admirable, but is it attainable?
After all, we cannot seem to rebuild and improve the levees of New Orleans, much less the shattered infrastructure of another country.
