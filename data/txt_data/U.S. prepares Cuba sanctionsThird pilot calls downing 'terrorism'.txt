President Clinton is expected to impose new sanctions against
Cuba in response to the shooting down of two civilian aircraft
by a Cuban fighter jet last weekend.
 
Officials said steps could include:
-- Ending all flights between the United States and Cuba.
-- Placing limits on Cuban-Americans who send money to Cuba.
-- Blocking phone service.
Cuba's actions "were a blatant violation of international law
and a violation of the norms of civilized behavior," said Secretary
of State Warren Christopher, who has requested U.N. action as
well.
Christopher said the planes, from a Cuban exile group, were in
international airspace. Cuba denied it. U.S. officials conceded
a third plane flew over Cuban waters within 12 miles of Havana
before the attack.
"We had been warned before . . . but we never thought Castro
would commit this act of terrorism of murdering two unarmed pilots,"
said Jose Basulto, the pilot who returned, at the Opa-Locka, Fla.,
airport.
Basulto is founder of Brothers to the Rescue, which patrols the
Straits of Florida in search of exiles. The group has brazenly
flown over Cuba dropping anti-Castro leaflets. U.S. aviation officials
are considering revoking Basulto's pilot license.
The search for four people from the planes resumes today. Cuba
has opened its waters to the searchers.
