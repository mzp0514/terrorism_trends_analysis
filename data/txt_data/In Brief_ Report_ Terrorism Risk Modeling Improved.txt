The ability of private insurers to protect against huge losses from
terrorism has improved since the Sept. 11 attacks, but a federal backstop
enacted after the attacks makes market assessment difficult, according to a
Bush administration report.
The report, which the President's Working Group on Financial Markets
released Monday, said that insurers have gotten better at modeling risk
exposure; reinsurance capacity has increased; insurers have shown willingness
to underwrite additional terrorism risk insurance; and there is more buyer
demand for coverage.
Congress put the backstop in place in 2002, setting a three-year deadline
for private insurers to start offering their own coverage without government
support. Congress later extended that deadline by two years, and insurers
have asked for even more time.
The report indicated that the terrorism risk insurance market is in a
good position to survive on its own.
"While there are inherent difficulties in evaluating the long-term nature
of the terrorism risk insurance market with a government program in place, a
number of positive developments have occurred," the report said. "Further
improvements in insurers' ability to model and manage terrorism risk ... will
likely contribute to the long-term development of the terrorism risk insurance
market."
