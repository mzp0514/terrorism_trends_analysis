The editorial ''Arafat should be heard,'' Nov. 29, states that Secretary of State George Shultz refused to grant an entry visa to Yasser Arafat in order ''to make a largely symbolic point about US opposition to terrorism.''
If he was really concerned about terrorism, however, he would have balanced this action, which is totally illegal under US-United Nations treaty obligations, with some action regarding current Israeli terrorism against its West Bank hostages, or its own Arab citizens.
Secretary Shultz might have recalled that in June 1967 Israel committed far more massive terrorism against Americans than the PLO has ever done when Israeli forces deliberately bombed, napalmed, and machine-gunned the USS Liberty, killing 34 Americans and wounding 171 others.
Joseph C. Harsch states it more accurately in his column ''Preferential treatment for Israel,'' Nov. 29, by pointing out that the ruling concern of Secretary Shultz is obviously ''preferential treatment'' for a client state that dominates the foreign policy of its American patron in all areas of interest to it.
