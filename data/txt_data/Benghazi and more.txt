I believe we are all missing the larger issue regarding the attack in Benghazi, Libya.
Remember when the Obama administration came into power, they tried to move the Gitmo trials to New York City? Their rationale was that there was no international, organized conspiracy (ie terrorism, which would require a military response), but rather the act of a few irrational individuals (a criminal act, requiring a DOJ response).
International terrorism is outside the liberals' paradigm. Fast forward to present, and Benghazi is treated as a spontaneous act of a few demented individuals, requiring the DOJ to send in the FBI to investigate, rather than the military to execute a response. It is political correctness on an international scale.
From the rhetoric in opinion columns and national news media, it is obvious that some of us slept through civics class. No promise made by a candidate for public office is legally enforceable - they do not meet the test of an oral contract. The only enforcement mechanism is the option of re-election.
If a politician repeatedly fails to live up to his/her promises, they risk not getting re-elected by their constituents. For a politician facing term limits, the last election is a roll of the dice, in that once elected, they literally have carte blanche to act as they wish.
So to my fellow citizens, I advise beware of politicians promises of future actions.
