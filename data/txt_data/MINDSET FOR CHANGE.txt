White nationalism is the viciously rapid spreading cancer that is destroying the soul of America. America, wake up and connect the dots. White nationalism is the evil mindset behind the horrific mass murder in El Paso, Texas. At least 22 people, mostly Hispanic, were killed in cold blood in El Paso. Patrick Crusius of Allen, Texas, has been charged with the killings.
The evil mindset of white nationalists will kill anyone who stands in their way, directly or indirectly.
America needs a mindset for change to prevent America from totally becoming AmeriKKKa. America cannot return to business as usual. America needs a major mindset for change that is more powerful than the National Rifle Association. We need a major mindset for change to stop the rising tide of the white nationalist's evil trinity of racism, classism and sexism throughout the entire landscape of America.
President Donald Trump's very own words, his very own rhetoric, fully backed by his very own politics, policies and practices of racism, classism and sexism have literally led to weak-minded white nationalists becoming the gun squad to carry out deadly acts of violence against minorities and anyone of any color who gets in their way.
Face the truth, America, and develop, implement and spread a mindset for change to stop this domestic terrorism known as white nationalism with the tremendous urgency of now!
