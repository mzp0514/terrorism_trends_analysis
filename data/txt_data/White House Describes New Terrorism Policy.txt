The White House issued its first public statement today on a new Government policy to counter terrorism.
The statement followed reports over the last several days that President Reagan signed a National Security Decision Directive on April 3 outlining a series of measures to fight terrorism.
White Houses issues first public statement on new Government policy to counter terrorism; White House spokesman Larry Speakes warns that states that practice or support terrorism 'cannot be allowed to do so without consequence'; says all channels of communications will be used to dissuade governments from harboring terrorists (M)Administration officials had said one element of the new policy was a switch from defensive to offensive action, partly by improving intelligence-gathering to stop terrorists before they act.
The statement by the chief White House spokesman, Larry Speakes, warned that ''the states that practice terrorism or actively support it cannot be allowed to do so without consequence.''
Mr. Speakes also said that it was ''the right of every legitimate government'' to combat terrorism, using ''all legal means available.''
The statement, which did not mention the directive on terrorism, said that there had been ''a detailed review'' of the subject and that this led to ''some conclusions on what we must do to protect ourselves.''
The new move on terrorism ''does not present any change in U.S. policy - rather, a refocused emphasis,'' the statement said.
