LONDON, Jan. 7 (AP) - The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Geoffrey Howe, left today for a three-day visit to Saudi Arabia, which has sharply criticized Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's refusal to receive an Arab delegation that included a representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
On Tuesday, the British Foreign Secretary, Francis Pym, said he was forced to postpone a planned visit to Saudi Arabia and three other Persian Gulf states after a Saudi rebuke over the Arab League delegation.
Mrs. Thatcher refused to receive the group, which was headed by King Hassan of Morocco and included Farouk Khaddoumi, political chief of the P.L.O. She cited the longstanding British policy of refusing direct talks with the P.L.O. until it renounces terrorism and recognizes Israel.
