Eskin reported a Pittsburgh football looked "very deflated" and was "like a marshmallow".
I, for one, am curious to see what the punishment for tossing a deflated ball in inarguably the least important game of the year is.
Three years ago, the NFL launched an investigation and concluded that the Patriots used a deflated football during their blowout victory over the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Championship game.
Eskin joined the 94WIP Morning Show on Friday.
While Eskin's certainly a loud buffoon, he purports that the NFL is now handling and investigating the football. "So the ballboy comes over, picks up the football, and he squeezes". It was so deflated.

Less than 12 hours later, the NFL sent a memo to reporters at the league owned network that basically said, "nothing to see here". The ball was found during the third quarter when Steelers third-round rookie quarterback Mason Rudolph at the helm.
"All footballs were in compliance with NFL rules following the pregame inspection process & all proper procedures were followed", the statement read, as tweeted by NFL Media's Ian Rapoport.
This isn't the first time the Steelers have had the pressure of their footballs questioned.
Unlike with the Patriots, the National Football League is ready to move on from this quickly.
