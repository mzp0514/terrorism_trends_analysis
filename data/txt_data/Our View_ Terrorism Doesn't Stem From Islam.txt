As journalists, the Jan. 7 attack on the newsroom of the French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo really hit home for us at The East Carolinian.
We believe that one of the more harmless yet effective ways to improve the world that we live in is through comedy and satire, so it is alarming and terrifying when our freedom to do so is compromised by hate mongers.
This is another example of the Islamic-extremist group ISIS causing tragedy across the world, but we at The East Carolinian believe that it is important to recognize that the attack was by a terrorist group, not true disciples of the Muslim religion.
Hate is the root of jihad and it was the root of the attacks in Paris. The worst way the world and we in America can respond is by sinking to ISIS's level and laying guilt on our Muslim neighbors.
The notion that seems to float around in the U.S. that "Not all Muslims are terrorists, but most terrorists are Muslims," is not only bigoted, but it is completely false; although Isis is a huge topic in the media, data still shows the vast majority of terrorist attacks in the world are not caused by Muslim extremists.
Astonishingly, in this time of grief and apprehension, one of the most rational and inspiring quotes has come from the brother of a policeman who was killed in the Charlie Hebdo tragedy.
The Guardian quotes Malek Merabet, brother of the fallen Ahmed Merabet as saying just days after the attack, "My brother was Muslim and he was killed by two terrorists, by two false Muslims. Islam is a religion of peace and love."
