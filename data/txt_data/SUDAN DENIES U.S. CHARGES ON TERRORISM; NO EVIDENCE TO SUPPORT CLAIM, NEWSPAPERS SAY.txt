Sudan on Friday denounced U.S. charges that it exported terrorism, saying officials in Washington have no evidence to support the claim.  The United States announced Wednesday that it was adding Sudan to its list of states sponsoring international terrorism because the country in northeastern Africa harbored foreign terrorists.
Egypt, Sudan's northern neighbor, has accused Sudan of training Muslim extremists active in Egypt.  Sudanese government newspapers published a statement by the Foreign Ministry Friday denying that Sudan hosted terrorist organizations and saying no terrorist acts ever had been launched from Sudan.  The ministry said the arguments the Americans had given for listing Sudan were so weak that "the main and real reason behind it was that the Sudan's civilized Islamic orientation was not acceptable to the U.S.  administration." But Interior Minister Brig. Abdul-Raheem Hussein defiantly said that Sudan would continue to arm its citizens and "go forward on the avenue of jihad, " or holy war.  "A nation whose women carry the Kalashnikov (Russian assault weapon) will never be subjugated or humiliated," he told female cadets graduating Thursday from a Home Defense Force training camp.  Every able-bodied Sudanese is supposed to undergo training for the militia.  Many Western experts contend that Islamic extremists, especially Iranians, conduct some of the training, with Egyptian, Algerian, Palestinian and other foreign militants among the cadets.  The listing means that Sudan is ineligible for U.S. aid other than humanitarian relief. Sudan received $71 million this year.
