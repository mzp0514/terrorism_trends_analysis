The Pentagon filed terrorism charges Monday against five detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, including an Ethiopian engineer accused of plotting with American Jose Padilla to blow up U.S. buildings.
The others charged are Canadian Omar Khadr, accused of killing a U.S. soldier with a grenade during a battle in Afghanistan when Khadr was 15; Saudi Arabians Ghassan al Sharbi and Jabran al Qahtani; and Algerian Sufyian Barhoumi.
The charges against Ethiopian Binyam Muhammad offer the first details of the government's case against Padilla, the first U.S. citizen arrested in the USA as an alleged enemy combatant. Padilla is being held in a Navy brig in Charleston, S.C.
According to the charges, Muhammad met Padilla in Pakistan in 2001 or 2002 after both men had joined al-Qaeda. They discussed with al-Qaeda leader Abu Zubaydah making a "dirty bomb" to spread radioactive material.
After being assigned a mission in the USA, the two men met with al-Qaeda planners Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and Saif al-Adil in Pakistan, the charges say. Mohammad told the pair they would be involved in plots to blow up gas stations and demolish apartment buildings.
Al-Qaeda gave Muhammad $6,000 and Padilla $10,000 for their mission, according to the military charges.
Khadr, 19, is charged with killing Army Sgt. 1st Class Christopher Speer in 2002.
