Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) called for harsh sanctions on the Iranian Central Bank and companies that do business with it. 
“I don’t think the sanctions have been as complete as they should be,” Feinstein said on “Fox News Sunday” about existing sanctions against Iran. “I wish they had sanctioned the Central Bank of Iran. That would affect oil, and maybe that’s why they didn’t do it.” Feinstein’s remarks came after a plot was unveiled last week in which Iran allegedly planned to assassinate Saudi Arabia’s ambassador on U.S. soil. For the U.S. to impose tougher sanctions would require the support of Russia and China, which have been hesitant to do so since they rely heavily on Iranian oil. Appearing on “This Week,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) said the United States should “put pressure on the Chinese and the Russians,” and that Iran is “a nation that is engaged in nation-state terrorism.” Senate Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) agreed, calling Iran a “rogue nation” that “supports terrorist nations.” On “State of the Union” McCain said the Obama administration’s engagement with Iran had “clearly been a failure.”
