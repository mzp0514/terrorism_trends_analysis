Still time to do what's right, Mr. President Dear President Trump, My name is Elizabeth Chaplin. As a DuPage County Board member, I represent approximately 90,000 people. When I woke up Aug. 12 to the horrific pictures of men carrying torches through the streets of Charlottesville and read the vile words a deep sadness came over me. 
Those torches represent the worst of this country. A time of violent acts of domestic terrorism. The sole purpose of carrying those torches was intimidation. They cause many people despair and anxiety. The event was described as a rally to "take America back." I have read that three people lost their lives including two police officers that were killed in a helicopter crash while hovering near the rally. This is unacceptable. It is a hard job being an elected official. Sometimes we are pushed out of our comfort zone. We find ourselves in situations that we never dreamed of. It is a position of great responsibility. We may have to take a position that may not be popular but is ultimately the right thing to do. What we need now is for you to display the strength, courage and good character of past leaders. You need to strongly condemn these acts for what they are, they are acts committed by white supremacists, white nationalists and neo-Nazis. This is domestic terrorism. You need to say it loud and clear and you need to let people know this behavior will not be tolerated. Your words will ring hollow if you continue to allow the likes of Steve Bannon and Seb Gorka to roam the White House. Mr. President, I am hoping and praying that you will find it in your heart to do what is right for this country and its people. Elizabeth Chaplin Downers Grove
