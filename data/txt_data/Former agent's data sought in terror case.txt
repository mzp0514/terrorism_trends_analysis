The plaintiffs in a terrorism-related federal lawsuit filed in New York are asking a Pittsburgh federal judge to compel a former undercover Israeli security service agent to provide them with the notes to his autobiography and other documents, according to court documents filed Wednesday. 
Mark Sokolow and 40 other people are suing the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority for seven terrorist attacks in Israel in which they were injured or their relatives were killed. They want to depose Mosab Hassan Yousef. 
Yousef, the son of Hamas founder sheik Hassan Yousef, was a member of Hamas who subsequently agreed to become an undercover agent for the Shin Bet, Israel's internal security agency, the suit states. Yousef has since converted to Christianity and been granted political asylum by the United States. He details his activities in a book, "Son of Hamas: A Gripping Account of Terror, Betrayal, Political Intrigue, and Unthinkable Choices." 
The plaintiffs say in their motion that they filed the request here because they were only able to serve the subpoena on Yousef by tracking him down at a Nov. 4 book signing in Beaver Falls. 
A spokesman for Tyndale House Publishers, which handles media requests for Yousef, couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
