DAYTON - For a handful of students at the University of Dayton who have studied human rights - learning about terrorists, torture and U.S. foreign policy - graduation means heading straight for the war on terrorism.
"These students are already disillusioned with the war, and yet they're going to Iraq anyway," said assistant professor Mark Ensalaco, a national expert on human rights and politics who heads up a human rights studies program at UD. "For soldiers, war means being prepared to give the ultimate sacrifice. That used to mean giving your life." But with today's war tactics, it could mean giving up their souls, he said.
The ROTC students gathered with other human rights students Friday afternoon to preview the first episode of America at a Crossroads, a PBS series of 11 independently produced documentaries on the war on terror. The series premiers Sunday, and PBS is sponsoring a slew of panel discussions around the country to stimulate a national dialogue on the war.
The five ROTC students, who likely will be tapped for Special Forces duty when they receive their commissions after graduation, feel well prepared to handle the daily challenges of fighting a new kind of war. Three of the students speak Arabic, and one completed an honors thesis on the war on terrorism.
"I think it has prepared us for the 'hearts and minds' battle that awaits us, to put ourselves in their shoes and have a positive impact over there," said senior Laura Fowler, who will enter the Army.
