 Few issues have stirred public passion so much as the question of how to handle terrorist suspects. President Obama vowed to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay in a year - a promise made impossible to keep by both cold reality and heated partisanship. The administration also has climbed down from trying 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in New York, and even hinted it might retain the Bush administration's system of military tribunals.
 There is a sensible middle path. A civilian terror court like the one proposed by Sen. Lindsey Graham could protect national security secrets without devolving into a kangaroo court. Experience in Israel, which has forgotten more about terrorism than America ever learned, is instructive. The Israelis are not soft on butchers, but they do afford suspects certain rights, including judicial review of their detention within two weeks of capture. They also prohibit torturing terrorist suspects.
 The Bush administration's approach was created on the fly during a time of national panic. For the long haul, a more defensible and systematic approach is needed. Terrorism is not regular warfare but it is not common criminality, either. It is a hybrid - and the best approach to dealing with captured terrorist suspects is to try them in a hybrid court.
