LONDON —
Investigators have arrested a man "on suspicion of terrorist offenses" and said they are treating a Tuesday morning crash outside the Houses of Parliament as a "terrorist incident," London police said.
 Here are the latest updates:

 "Another terrorist attack in London," the president wrote. "These animals are crazy and must be dealt with through toughness and strength!"
 Authorities said three people suffered injuries that did not appear to be life-threatening on Tuesday morning after a man in his late 20s slammed a silver Ford Fiesta into cyclists and pedestrians in front of the Houses of Parliament. The car stopped when it hit a barrier, police said.
 The man, who has not been identified, was arrested on suspicion of terrorism offenses.
 "Given that this appears to be a deliberate act, the method and this being an iconic site, we are treating it as a terrorist incident and the investigation is being led by officers from the Counter Terrorism Command," Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said.
 Authorities do not believe any other suspects were involved in the incident.
 Update 7:08 a.m. EDT Aug. 14: Three people were injured when a man drove through security barriers outside the U.K. Houses of Parliament, the London Ambulance Service tweeted Tuesday.

 "My thoughts are with those injured in the incident in Westminster and my thanks to the emergency services for their immediate and courageous response," she tweeted.
