ENGLAND LOWERED its terrorism threat level from "critical" to "severe" on Saturday in spite of a report that intelligence officials have flagged 23,000 possible extremists living in the country.
Roughly 3,000 of those identified as ISIS sympathizers are believed to pose a genuine threat and are under investigation, according to the Times of London. The 20,000 others were part of previous investigations and are believed to be a "residual risk," the Times reported.
Authorities, meanwhile, continued to make progress in unraveling the plot behind the Manchester bombing. Britain's top counterterrorism police officer said Saturday authorities have dismantled a "large part" of the terror cell around suicide bomber Salman Abedi, who killed 22 people and wounded dozens at an Ariana Grande concert Monday in Manchester.
Prime Minister Theresa May said "a significant amount of police activity" and several arrests led to the threat level being lowered. But she urged Britons to remain vigilant and said soldiers would remain at high-profile sites throughout the weekend.
Police made two more arrests Saturday, bringing the number of suspects in custody to 11. All are men, between ages 18 and 44. Abedi's father and brother remain in custody in Libya as well.
Manchester police said the two men, ages 20 and 22, detained early Saturday in the northwest England city were being held on suspicion of terrorism offenses. A bomb scare later led to the evacuation of London's Old Vic Theatre during a matinee performance of "Woyzeck."
