After reading the article, "New security department proposed" (BDN, June 7), I would like to provide the Bangor Daily News a look at France's resolution of fighting terrorism.
In response to terrorism in France in the 1970s, the Paris government developed a wide range of strategies and methods to deal with the aggression.
Since 1984, various French law enforcement branches, military and intelligence services have been conducting counterterrorism work together in one agency, the Ant-Terrorist Coordination Unit. The agency also liaises with their international counterparts, diplomatic sources, civil authorities and emergency services included in the prevention and suppression of internal menaces.
To deal with terrorist situations, special units were formed by both military and police forces. They include helicopter units designed to combat aerial terrorism and commando teams that are similar to U.S. Army Delta Force and the FBI Hostage Rescue Unit.
Under government public security measures, military and police personnel jointly guard public establishments, transportation facilities and sensitive installations. Their task is deterrence and to serve as a reaction force toany possible terrorist attacks directed against the sites.
The consequences of the vast reorganization of French internal security forces soon became apparent. Between 1975 and 1985, terrorist incidents in France reached 600 a year. After 1986, they have fallen sharply to a practically irrelevant level.
While the dangers of terrorism in France currently remain low, French authorities are not complacent on new subversive threats, and they are determined to stamp out or contain acts of terrorism with little loss of lives and civil liberties.
