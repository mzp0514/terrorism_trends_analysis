Thank you for publishing the infallible article titled "Terrorism isn't spelled M-u-s-l-i-m" on September 10, 2015. In our modern world, society holds close to it the common misconception that all Muslims are terrorists. A majority of Americans, whether consciously or not, label Muslims as violent people who hate America and are out to destroy it. This misconception is not only completely out-of-the-question nonsense, but is also unlawful.
By associating terrorism directly with Muslims, the American people are oppressing all Muslim people and segregating them from the rest of the country. There was even a recent example of this in the news only a few days ago. A fourteen-year-old Muslim boy named Ahmed Mohamed brought a clock he made on his own to school and the school called the cops on him in fear that it was a bomb. We cannot continue to persecute these groups of people just because of the color of their skin, where they come from or how they look. We are all the same and we are all made equally.
As NC State students, I urge us all to be kind to everyone we meet and open our minds more. We must not be quick to make assumptions but rather take time to learn the real truth. Welcome new people into your community. Invite other students to learn more about other cultures and religions. Seek to become a part of a diverse community. Go out and greet everyone and anyone you meet with a smile on your face and an open mind. Always remember, it doesn't matter who you are, or where you come from, or what you look like; we are all the same.
