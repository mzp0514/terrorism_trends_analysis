Boeing Co. said Friday that production of the C-17 cargo plane could end in 2009. But that's far from being a sure thing, given the aircraft's vital role in the war on terror and the number of jobs the program sustains in key political-battleground states such as Missouri and California.
While most of the C-17's production takes place in Long Beach, Calif., 19 percent of the plane's airframe is assembled in St. Louis, Boeing said. The C-17 program supports about 1,850 workers in Missouri, while payments to Missouri-based suppliers total about $100 million a year. 
About 950 of Boeing's St. Louis employees work on the C-17, with the rest of the jobs spread among 35 suppliers, including Patriot Machine Inc. in St. Charles and GKN Aerospace Services in Hazelwood.
The C-17 Globemaster III program ranks as one of Boeing's largest individual defense programs, contributing about $3.8 billion a year in annual revenue, including maintenance and support contracts. That represents about 12 percent of the $31 billion in annual revenue generated by Boeing's St. Louis-based defense business.
Boeing has told some suppliers to stop work on four C-17s that don't have buyers. This is the first step toward shutting down the plane's production line.
In the last year, Boeing has warned that more orders were needed to extend C-17 production into the next decade. The Air Force has not made a decision to purchase more C-17s beyond the current plan to buy 180.
That takes the line through early 2008, and another 15 or so orders from customers such as NATO and Australia extends production into 2009.
"I have to tell you, I think this may be the single stupidest decision I've seen made on a major weapons system in the last 10 years," said Loren Thompson, chief operating officer of the Lexington Institute, a think tank based in Virginia. "It's just so obvious we're going to need more than 180 C-17s that I suspect in the end we're going to end up paying twice as much as we need to get the extra planes."
In a conference call with reporters, Boeing executives conceded that the shut-down process is reversible if more orders are placed by the U.S. military or international customers.
If the program ends in 2009, defense analysts say, Boeing could fill the void by winning a Pentagon contract to build a new fleet of tankers that refuel planes in the air.
The C-17 program spent long stretches in the Pentagon's doghouse in the 1980s and 1990s only to emerge as a linchpin in President George W. Bush's war on terrorism. Top Air Force brass have said the planes, which cost about $200 million apiece, have proved their worth "in gold."
In the early 1990s, then-Defense Secretary Dick Cheney cut the number of C-17s being ordered to 120 from 210, and when the Air Force eventually realized it needed more, the added start-up expenses cost taxpayers billions of dollars extra, Thompson said.
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., blasted the Bush administration for the C-17's predicament.
"The Air Force has identified additional C-17 aircraft as its No. 1 unfunded priority to the Congress, yet the administration is moving forward with its premature and irresponsible decision to halt C-17 production," Boxer said in a statement.
