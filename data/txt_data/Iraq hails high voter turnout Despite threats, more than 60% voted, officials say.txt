Highlight: Iraq's al-Maliki hails vote as 'slap' to terrorism as UN says April deadliest month this year
Body


- Iraq's prime minister hailed a high turnout in nationwide elections as a slap in the face of terrorism Thursday, but his upbeat comments were tempered by a U.N. announcement that last month's death toll was the highest so far this year amid a sharp spike in sectarian bloodshed.
Nouri al-Maliki, who has held power since 2006, also said he would open talks with blocs from all sects and factions to seek their support as he moves to secure a third four-year term. Significantly, violence was relatively low in the first nationwide balloting since U.S. forces withdrew, although scattered attacks killed five people.
Election workers, meanwhile, transported ballot boxes to counting centers and tallied votes a day after Iraqis cast ballots in parliamentary elections despite widespread fears of attacks. Authorities have not given a timetable for releasing results, and al-Maliki declined to speculate how his mainly Shiite bloc had fared. It took about two weeks in the last elections four years ago for results to be announced.
More than 9,000 candidates ran, with an estimated 22 million eligible voters. Turnout was more than 60 percent, said Safaa al-Moussawi, a spokesman for the commission overseeing the election.
