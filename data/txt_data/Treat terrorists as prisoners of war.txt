Treat terrorists as prisoners of war
Is there a war on terrorism still going on? We have not heard a declaration of cease fire or surrender. Yet President Obama and his companions have declared that the alleged terrorists and proud, self-confessed terrorists be given all the rights of a U.S. citizen in civil trials for acts of terrorism against the United States of America. Yet our soldiers, when charged for alleged killing of civilians are held in military prisons, are interrogated under military law (as opposed to the civil law the terrorists will enjoy) and are sentenced under military law as opposed to our civil law.
So who do this president and his companions consider are the terrorists if they are involved with the "war on terrorism?"
If you believe that terrorists should be treated as prisoners of war, interrogated as prisoners of war, tried and sentenced as prisoners of war according to military law, please contact the president or the state's congressional delegation.
Support our soldiers. Please don't let this supreme insult, mockery and scorn continue to be hurled at them. Remind this president and our Congress who the real terrorists are. Demand that terrorists be treated as prisoners of war.
While doing so, let them know that no U.S. city and U.S. court of law should be made to be used as a platform for the spewing of hatred for the U.S., and the inciting of further terrorist acts.
