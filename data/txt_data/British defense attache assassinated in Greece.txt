Pressure: Terrorist group is suspected
ATHENS, Greece (AP) - A British defense attache was assassinated Thursday and police found evidence pointing to the terrorist group called November 17, whose members have eluded capture despite a 25-year legacy of bloodshed.
Greek officials are under enormous pressure to show results after what appears to be the group's 22nd slaying: a .45-caliber barrage into the chest and stomach of Brig.
Stephen Saunders, the defense attache in the British Embassy, while he drove to a meeting to discuss possible tank sales to Greece.
Another failure to make an arrest would be an embarrassing blow for a nation desperately trying to shed its image as an unstable corner of Western Europe. Greece is expected to receive approval to join the EU's single currency group later this month in Portugal.
"Greece is unable to face the phenomenon of terrorism," complained parliament member Dora Bakoyannis, whose politician husband, Pavlos, was killed by the November 17 group in 1989. "We must not have taboos to take the steps needed."
Such demands also are coming from Washington. Among the November 17 victims are four American officials and one U.S. Embassy employee.
A report last week by a congressional commission proposed sanctions on Greece and Pakistan for "not cooperating fully" in the battle against terrorism. Hearings are scheduled next week. The State Department has described Greece as "one of the weakest links" in anti-terrorism efforts in Europe.
The spotlight also is on Greece to develop a security plan for the 2004 Olympics. Saunders, 52, was shot near the main stadium for the games.
