Stress associated with watching the Sept 11, 2001, attacks on television and subsequent fears of terrorism increased cardiac problems threefold among Americans in the two years after the attacks, according to a study last week in the Archives of General Psychiatry.
The study is the first to document in a national sample that the effects of watching stressful events on TV are every bit as real as the effects from events that happen directly to you, and that they can harm people who previously did not have heart problems, said study leader Alison Holman, a family nurse practitioner and a health psychologist at the University of California at Irvine.
A year after the attacks, Holman and her colleagues found in a national sample of 2,592 people, the rate of heart problems among people who reported being highly stressed after the attacks was 2.98 times the previous rate. Two years after the attacks, the rate was 3.12 times as high.
By the three-year mark, the rate of heart problems was 1.38 times that of before the attacks, suggesting that the cardiac effects of stressful events may recede with time.
"This study is unique in that we are seeing an increased incidence in reports of physician-diagnosed cardiovascular ailments among people who watched the attacks live on TV or saw the replayed videos later," Holman said. She added that continuing stress about terrorism had compounded the problem.
"These findings raise the question whether the heightened worries about terrorism may be triggered by ongoing terror alerts, and if so, what is the best way to communicate such risks to the public."
