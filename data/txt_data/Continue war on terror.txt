We cannot let the terrorists win. The struggle against Islamic terrorism is a noble cause, to save America and the American way of life.
We will win despite all the protest marchers and radical leftist groups such as MoveOn.org, and the Cindy Sheehans who think their rhetoric will destroy President Bush's strong resolve.
Some feel we are making "sacrifices" for security. What about the many firemen and policemen and 3,000 innocent people who were sacrificed on 9-11?
What we are being asked to do is so little. We are in for the long haul.
Our goal in Iraq is against terrorism; to spread freedom and democracy. We cannot appease these terrorists. If this country forgets that, we will lose and suffer the consequences.
The more the suffering, the greater the terrorist rejoices. The war on terrorism must go on. This is a battle against barbarism and civilization.
We have a great responsibility to win our struggle against insurgent Islamist aggression, as we had to win World War II. If we do not pay with our sacrifices now, our children and grandchildren will pay in greater numbers later.
We must not let those pacifists and anti-war, anti-America groups in this country take away our basic right; the right to defend our country and its people.
