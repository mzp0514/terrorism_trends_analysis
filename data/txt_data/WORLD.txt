RABAT, MOROCCO
Government puts nation on alert for terrorism
Morocco raised its terrorism alert to its highest level and ordered stepped-up security nationwide Friday, citing a "serious threat of a terrorist act."
The country's top police, intelligence and security officials met Friday to discuss terrorist threats and decided to raise the level to maximum, the state news agency MAP said, citing an Interior Ministry statement.
The maximum level "indicates a serious threat of a terrorist act and demands extreme mobilization by the bodies concerned," the statement said.
No details about the threat were reported.
PARIS
Tribute to man killed in raid turns violent
Some 50 masked attackers smashed cars and clashed with police in northeast Paris on Friday night. Three officers were injured, police said.
The crowd had gathered at Place Gambetta in the city's working class 20th district to honor a young man killed during a police raid last month, according to the city police department.
No arrests were reported.
Tension has remained high between police and French youths, especially minorities in rundown housing projects, since riots erupted in such neighborhoods nationwide in 2005.
