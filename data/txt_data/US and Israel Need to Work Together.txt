The editorial ''Peace for Terror,'' Aug. 17, bears rereading and
reprinting: The Israeli government has been launching offensive and
illegal raids into Lebanon while citing Arafat for ''terrorism.''
Israel justifies this, with the support of the US government, in
terms of ''security.''
Yet Israeli attacks into Lebanon and the
continued oppression of Palestinians in Israel and the occupied
territories only makes for more enemies. The longtime Israeli
policy of getting rid of Palestinian Arabs or breaking their spirit
is no longer viable.
''Transferring'' to other countries is not realistic, and
internal oppression will lead only to frustration and violence. For
its own security Israel needs to rethink its policy. Unfortunately,
your conclusion, ''Real peace in the Middle East can't be made at
the expense of one party. The United States must end its silence,''
offers little hope. Only if Israel and our government take an
honest look at Israel's ''security'' needs will there be peace in
the Middle East.
