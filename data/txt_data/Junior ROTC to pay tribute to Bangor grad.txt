A moment of silence is planned during Friday's boys basketball game at Bangor High School for Army Staff Sgt. James Kristofer "Kris" Ciraso, a 1999 graduate killed last week by a roadside bomb in Iraq.
In addition, the Bangor High School Junior ROTC color guard will participate in Friday night's ceremony in honor of Ciraso, 26, said Col. Jackson Kurtzman, who was Ciraso's Junior ROTC adviser in high school.
Ciraso's parents, Paul and Nancy Ciraso, now live in Waltham, Mass., and a funeral is expected there.
Ciraso, formerly of Bangor and Waltham, died from injuries he suffered when an improvised explosive device detonated near his military vehicle in Baghdad, according to a Department of Defense news release.
A member of the Junior ROTC program throughout high school, Ciraso was accepted into the Maine Army National Guard's Company B 3rd Battalion while still a junior.
He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, Fort Hood, Texas, and deployed to Iraq in October.
The soldier's military awards and decorations include the Army Commendation Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Noncommissioned Officer Professional Development Ribbon, Army Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon, and Weapon Qualification Rifle Expert.
