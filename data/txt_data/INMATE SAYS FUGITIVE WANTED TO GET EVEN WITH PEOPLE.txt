PETERSBURG _ A man charged with two counts of murder wanted
revenge on people who "screwed him over," a prison inmate testified
"He said he'd hold court in the street (and) take as many with
him as he could," said Robert Matthews, an inmate at the
Huttonsville Correctional Center.
The trial of Billy Joe Hottle was scheduled to resume today in
Grant County.
Hottle, 20, of Petersburg is accused in the Aug. 22
deaths of Leon Miller, 24, and Donna Ours, 27, in their Cabins home
The couple was shot 17 days after Hottle walked away from a
Huttonsville work camp.  Hottle was convicted last month of
first-degree murder in the Aug. 23 slaying of a Keyser 7-Eleven clerk
His cousin, Craig Swick, also is charged with three counts of
murder and is awaiting trial.  Swick, 23, of Petersburg walked away
from the Charleston Work-Release Center Aug. 15, 1993.  Both were
captured Aug. 27 after a shootout in downtown Petersburg.
Matthews testified Tuesday that Hottle had a typed plan that
included potential acts of terrorism designed to confuse and distract
police, including a fire at an oil storage depot.
He said pages missing from a document recovered by police
included the initials and addresses of people against whom Hottle
held a grudge, as well as an escape shopping list.
