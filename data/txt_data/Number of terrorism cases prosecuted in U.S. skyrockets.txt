Federal prosecutions of terrorism cases have increased tenfold since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks as authorities expanded the types of crimes included, Justice Department records show.
During the 2002 fiscal year, which began 19 days after the attacks on New York and Washington, federal prosecutors charged 1,208 individuals with crimes they classified as related to terrorism or international security, compared with just 115 the previous year, according to records obtained by Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC).
Nearly half of the terrorism prosecutions last year were initiated by investigators from the Social Security Administration and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The two agencies had just two such cases the previous year. Many of the new cases arose from investigations aimed at illegal aliens and airport workers with fake Social Security numbers.
Justice Department officials refused to comment directly on the TRAC data, but Attorney General John Ashcroft said in an interview Wednesday that preventing terrorist attacks had been the government's top priority since Sept. 11, 2001. He said there had been "monumental progress" in achieving that goal.
Prevention "is more important than prosecution," he said. "But very frequently these priorities do not compete, they complement. In many instances prosecution has been a real aid to our prevention effort by helping generate valuable intelligence."
The FBI, which initiated almost three-quarters of all terrorism-related prosecutions in 2001, accounted for less than a third of the cases last year. But the number of terrorism charges based on FBI investigations still increased from 84 in 2001 to 377 last year.
The expansion of crimes considered terrorism-related also resulted in lower prison sentences, on the average, for the 394 individuals convicted in terrorism cases last year. The median jail term for those 394 was two months, down from 21 months for the 41 individuals convicted in terrorism-related cases in 2001.
The median sentence for terrorism convictions initiated by the INS was just one month, while half the sentences for such convictions in cases started by Social Security investigators was two months. For convictions stemming from FBI investigations, in contrast, the median sentence was 12 months.
Since Sept. 11, 2001, prosecutors declined to pursue just a third of the terrorism-related cases brought to them, compared with two-thirds the previous year. Prosecutors also decided whether to prosecute such cases five times faster last year than in 2001, when they took, on average, nearly a year to decide.
