Good news, everyone: President Obama's national security team says that Iran, long known as the world's chief sponsor of terrorism, has left the dark side.
Just as Obama is trying to wrap up a nuclear deal with the mullahs, his intelligence experts have published the annual Worldwide Threat Assessment. Turn to the section on terror. You'll find not a word about Iran or its proxy in bloodshed, Hezbollah.
Three years ago: "We are also concerned about Iranian plotting against U.S. or allied interests overseas."
Two years ago: "We continue to assess that (Hezbollah) maintains a strong anti-U.S. agenda but is reluctant to confront the United States directly outside the Middle East."
Last year: "Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah continue to directly threaten the interests of U.S. allies."
This year: silence, despite the fact that, as the Washington Institute for Near East Policy concluded in 2014: "Over the past few years, Iran's state sponsorship of terrorism has increased dramatically to levels not seen since the late 1980s and early 1990s."
Obama is courting Iran as an ally against ISIS. And Obama is struggling to reach an Iranian nuke pact.
Meanwhile, justly afraid that the President is on the verge of a disastrous deal, many in Congress are offering scathing assessments of the potential terms as they've been outlined.
For Obama, now would have been a terrible moment to brand Iran as a sponsor of terrorism. The question that demands an answer: Did his administration massage the intelligence report to avoid giving offense to the mullahs or ammunition to his critics? Seems so.
