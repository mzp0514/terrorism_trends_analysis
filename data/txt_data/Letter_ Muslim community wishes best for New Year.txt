The Muslim community in Dubuque and its vicinity wishes everyone the best for the New Year with prayers for peace and happiness. The Tri-State Muslim Community wants to share the following views with all the people in the tri-state area: * We deplore and condemn terrorism in any form. Terrorism is a criminal act and not a religious dictum regardless of who commits it under whatever motto or pretext. * We hold all faith communities in the highest regard. We all share the same noble and peaceful values. * We share many of the same hopes, challenges, and aspirations as we work hand-in-hand with our fellow community members to make the tri-state area a safe and vibrant community. * We are most thankful for the warmth, outreach, and support of our fellow citizens. We gladly call the tri-state area our home. * We continually aspire toward the highest quality of service and professionalism that our members have provided to the tri-state area for many decades. * We hope the ongoing media coverage on terrorism and related issues will encourage people of all faiths to focus on developing a dialogue for peace and understanding of our shared values. We welcome your comments and dialogue. Please contact us at Info@Tri StateIslamicCenter.org.
