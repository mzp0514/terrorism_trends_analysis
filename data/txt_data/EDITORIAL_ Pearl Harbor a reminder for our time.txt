Dec. 08--On Monday, America commemorated the 74th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor.
The day is a somber day as the surprise attack killed 2,400 servicemen and crippled our Navy's Pacific fighting force.
But rather than being remembered as a day of sadness and shame, we view Pearl Harbor as a reminder of just how strong America once was. Our nation was surprised on Pearl Harbor, but our response was swift and mighty.
Under President Roosevelt's leadership, American united in a way that was unprecedented. Our nation shifted into war mode. That meant our industrial might turned toward making weapons and machines of war.
The effort was necessary to defeat the evil the world faced.
Our nation today faces a similar kind of evil with the growing threat of Islamic terrorism.
The difference today is two-fold. First, unlike in 1941 when we clearly knew where our enemy was hiding, today terrorists are far more sinister. As the recent attacks in San Bernardino, Calif., proved, sometimes the terrorists are walking among us.
The second difference is a question that has yet to be fully answered -- Does America have what it takes to defeat terrorism in the world?
If our nation and its leaders are unable to answer that question now, our future looks bleak indeed.
Terrorism must be stopped at any cost.
