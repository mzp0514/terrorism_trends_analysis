Thinking Right on the week gone by:
* There's gambling in the casinos. I'm shocked. Shocked, too, by the revelation that political money favors power. It's not the money gap that will keep Republicans in power in the General Assembly. It's the Voting Rights Act and redistricting. The money gap could be the reverse; the GOP still prevails.
* The tragedy of needlessly lost life has produced the most memorable quotes of any recent breaking news story. From the ex-Marine, who killed in self-defense when accosted while walking home from a restaurant job where he'd earned $12 in tips: "I have holes in my shoes and they're driving a Cadillac, yet they pick me." From the teen girl's funeral service: "There's a high cost to low living, a high price for living a reckless life."
* The Southern Christian Leadership Conference plans "conflict resolution" centers in Europe and the Middle East. More appropriate locations might be in streets and neighborhoods here. But the Carter Presidential Center's Atlanta Project of the early '90s demonstrates that the greater the distance, the grander the possibilities for claiming success. Reality can be cruel to intentions; you don't want to stand too close.
* Here's a chance, though, for the American Civil Liberties Union to branch out. Japan's parliament is debating an education measure requiring teachers to instill in students "an attitude that respects tradition and culture, and loves the nation and the homeland that have fostered them." Maybe we should get the Japanese to establish patriotism centers here.
* When the bored and comfortable obsess on their "predicament," there's always the risk that the loose, macho-mouth radicalism of the self-absorbed can have disastrous consequences --- as probably would have been the case with the 17 Canadians accused of plotting terrorism. Tell people often enough that they're of a put-upon race, class or religion, and this is what you get.
* When political reporters get bored, they convene on a barely important special election, such as the one to fill the Duke Cunningham congressional seat in California, and sanctify it as a bad, bad omen of things to come in November for President Bush and control of Congress. Until the Republican, Brian Bilbray, wins, boosted by a get-tough stand on illegal immigration. Then it's "yes, he won, but . . . "
* Such is the state of the modern blend of politics and entertainment that an Al Gore flick is taken as a serious policy position.
* While we continue to strip-search Grandma, and while "profiling" remains the most despicable act of cultural insensitivity, pick Grandma or the Moultrie Methodist out of this list of Canadian terrorism suspects: Shareef Abelhaleen, Fahim Ahmad, Zakaria Amara, Asad Ansari, Steven Vikash Chand, alias Abdul Shakur, Mohammed Dirie, Amin Mohamed Durrani, Ahmad Mustafa Ghany, Qayyum Abdul Jamal, Jahmaal James, Saad Khalid and Yasim Abdi Mohamed.
* Marvelous news on education: A respected national outfit in the field of education, the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, finds Georgia in the top eight nationally in developing a world history curriculum with substance.
* Good news, too, on the Criterion-Referenced Competency Tests given 1.4 million students in third, fifth and eighth grades. More than 75,000 failed either reading or math. That's not good news. Study harder. The good news is that standards for passing are higher this year. In time, as the standards are edged up, Georgia students will be nudged to national competitiveness. We're on course. Don't panic. Don't succumb to pressure. Don't change the game plan.
* The education workplace union, the Georgia Association of Educators, endorses Lt. Gov. Mark Taylor in the primary --- and surely will in November if he wins. Any Republican branded with a GAE endorsement is suspect in my book.
* Sneaky. Powerfully sneaky. Such is U.S. Rep. John Linder's bill, called the U.S. General Population Act, to align this country's immigration laws with Mexico's. You'll certainly see no protests demanding that.
* Republican Chuck Scheid wants to abolish the job he seeks, labor commissioner. Could. Should. The department doesn't need an elected head. Any competent bureaucrat would do just fine. No more reason to have an elected head there than at the Department of Administrative Services.
* Thinking Right blogger "Atif" hears of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's demise and suggests that condolences be sent to Cynthia McKinney. Low. Very low. Shocking what they say in the blogosphere.
* Jim Wooten is the associate editorial page editor. His column appears Fridays, Sundays and Tuesdays.

Here is what some folks had to say on Thursday's blog:
The topic
Al-Zarqawi dead! Meet the bus, Satan.
The comments
Littleguy: New definition of terror: Al-Zarqawi hearing the U.S. jets coming.
Let's Reason: I want America to win the war on terrorism; but we are naive if we think that al-Zarqawi's death is some great victory. You can cut off the head of the Hydra and two more heads will grow.
