The Pan-Africanist Congress, a militant black party suspected by police of carrying out several high-profile terrorist attacks on whites in the past year, announced yesterday it is suspending its armed struggle.
The decision clears the way for the congress to take part in South Africa's first universal suffrage election on April 27, and for its armed wing, the Azanian People's Liberation Army, to join a 10,000-member, multi-party national peace-keeping force scheduled to begin training later this month.
A poll released yesterday by the nation's largest newspaper, the Sunday Times, showed the PAC running in fifth place, with less than 2 percent of the vote.
PAC President Clarence Makwetu said his organization had made the move ''because of our commitment to peace and free and fair elections.''
However, the step came as the PAC was facing pressure from longtime backers in Africa, who have been critical of its continuing association with terrorism at a time when the anti-apartheid struggle has been won and democracy is about to dawn in South Africa.
The government of Tanzania, for three decades the nation that provided the most hospitable haven for PAC exiles, announced last week that it would no longer tolerate PAC guerrillas -- believed to number more than a thousand -- issuing hostile statements or plotting against South Africans on its soil.
It remains to be seen if yesterday's PAC announcement will have any effect on the activities of the liberation army.
