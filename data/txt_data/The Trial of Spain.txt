The trial of 32 senior officers on charges of plotting to extinguish Spanish democracy could and should be a landmark, and not just for Spain. A year ago, the Madrid Parliament was besieged by Civil Guards trying to trigger a military coup.
Editorial discusses trial of 32 senior Spanish officers on charges of plotting to extinguish Spanish democracyThe effort failed, and its leaders looked briefly ludicrous -until they began threatening to try again. So what is really on trial is a fledgling democracy's ability to punish with more than token penalties the treason of an overgrown military establishment.
Spain has been formally democratic since Generalissimo Franco's death in 1975. But the officer corps remains authoritarian, and the Government's past inability to curb the terrorism of Basque separatists has provided a pretext for incessant agitation.
But the complaints are specious. Officers are quick to blame politicians when terrorism mounts, but give scant credit to civilian authority when the killing ebbs - as it did over recent months until the eve of the courts-martial.
The public appeal of a strong monarch, King Juan Carlos, kept the generals in their barracks a year ago. But that only bought time.  What Spain's democracy needs now is a demonstration that a military tribunal can treat military conspirators fairly; conviction could bring the ringleaders 30 years in jail. Spain wants to join the NATO alliance, a step eagerly favored by its generals. But every allied parliament has to approve. Their votes surely depend on the conduct of the great trial now begun.
