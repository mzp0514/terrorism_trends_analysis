FORT WORTH, Texas — Complicated by a federal investigation into possible terrorist ties and the prospect of mental issues, the prosecution of Army Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan will likely be a lengthy and intricate process, military legal experts say. 
Hasan has been identified by military officials as the lone suspect in the Fort Hood, Texas, shootings last week that killed 13 and wounded more than 30 — the deadliest mass shooting at a U.S. military installation. 
A former Army staff judge advocate and military law expert at Texas Tech University suggests that it could take about two years to go to the military equivalent of a trial, depending on the defendant's health. And the outcome of the case would likely end up mired in complex appeals. 
"We never had a case quite like this before ... because of pretrial publicity, it will create a lot of complications," said Richard Rosen, vice chairman of the university's law school and former military justice attorney at Fort Hood. 
Many factors will make the legal process challenging for prosecutors and defense attorneys: the number of witnesses, whether the suspect's actions were related to terrorism, his mental capacity and the prospect of the death penalty.  
Federal officials have indicated that the case against Hasan would be handled by military justice because the suspect is a service member, the victims are Defense Department employees and the incident occurred at a military installation. It also signals that federal officials will not pursue a terrorism angle, but military legal experts say federal prosecutors could revisit terrorism-related crimes separately. 
But if Hasan faces military death penalty charges, prosecutors will be required to prove premeditation.
