To the Editor:
As a member of an organization (New York Area Skeptics Inc.) dedicated to promoting critical thinking and scientific literacy, I applaud John Allen Paulos's essay ''The Odds Are You're Innumerate'' (Jan. 1).
I do, however, have one small bone to pick with him in regard to calling Americans silly for canceling foreign trips in fear of terrorism; a fear frequently scoffed at by comparing the low ''probability'' of terrorism deaths to those from more mundane causes.
The fact is that the tiny number of traveling Americans killed compared to those not killed during any given time period has nothing to do with such a ratio for some future period of time. While it is quite difficult to affect the rate of people falling in their bathtubs, intentional activities are obviously subject to change. (I suspect the probability of being injured on a Pan Am flight was intolerably high last December.) Significant escalations in mortality rates are easily achievable by sufficiently motivated individuals. If Mr. Paulos had a reasonable suspicion (whether ultimately realized or not) that an unknown number of American carriers might be the targets for terrorists in the coming weeks, would he be comfortable sending his loved ones abroad? Even if just one plane out of all those hundreds would probably go down?
