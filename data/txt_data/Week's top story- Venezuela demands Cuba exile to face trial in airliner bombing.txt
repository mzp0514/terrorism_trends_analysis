If the U.S. extradites a Cuban exile wanted in a 1976 airliner bombing, he would not be turned over to Cuba but would remain in Venezuela to face justice, said Vice-President Jose Vicente Rangel. Venezuela has demanded that Luis Posada Carriles be extradited to face trial in the bombing, which killed 73 people when the Cuban airliner exploded after departing from Caracas. U.S. authorities arrested him in Miami, where he awaiting a decision on his request for U.S. political asylum. U.S. officials have said they would not hand over those suspected of crimes to any country that would then turn them over to Fidel Castro's government. 
Posada, a naturalized Venezuelan citizen, is wanted on murder and treason charges. The case presents a difficult situation for the U.S. because it has the Castro regime calling on it to fight terrorism by handing over Posada. Recently revealed documents show CIA officials had some knowledge of the bomb attempt some time before the plane in question took off, further complicating matters. "This case is going to be emblematic, to assess exactly what is the final position of the American government and particularly President Bush with respect to terrorism," Rangel said. What is unclear is whether if statue of limitations are still in effect under Venezuelan law.
