LISBURN, Northern Ireland (AP) - Queen Elizabeth II visited Northern Ireland on Saturday for the first time since 1977.  She saluted a British Army regiment that is battling the terrorist Irish Republican Army.
Roads were blocked, and security was intense as the monarch arrived in Lisburn, a southern suburb of Belfast, to present colors to the Ulster Defense Regiment, a locally raised and largely part-time force. It is made up mostly of Protestants.  The regiment, the largest and youngest in the British Army, enjoys strong support from Northern Ireland's Protestant majority. But the regiment is widely distrusted by Roman Catholics and is attacked by the IRA, which is seeking to drive the British from Northern Ireland and link the province with the Irish Republic to the south.  The queen said in a speech to the regiment, ''The UDR stands for those who are not prepared to stand by and let evil prosper.  ''It provides for everyone in Northern Ireland, regardless of faith or background, the opportunity to make a contribution to the defeat of terrorism.  ''That contribution needs courage and a sense of duty together with a determination - which I share - that terrorism cannot be allowed to win.'' Since the regiment was formed in 1970, 195 members have been killed, most of them while off-duty.
