DAVOS, Switzerland -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned the United States and other rich countries Friday that a too-narrow focus on fighting terrorism could worsen global tensions and threaten human rights.
Addressing the World Economic Forum, the U.N. chief said international terrorism threatens peace and stability and "has the potential to exacerbate cultural, religious and ethnic dividing lines."
Yet in unusually blunt criticism apparently aimed at the Bush administration, he said that the war against terror also carried the risk of aggravating such tensions, "as well as raising concerns about protection of human rights and civil liberties."
The war on terror also has redirected world attention "dangerously away" from other pressing concerns such as poverty, hunger and disease, Annan said, adding that it was "time to rebalance the international agenda."
The aftermath of the war and dealing with the threat of terrorism has been a running theme this year at the annual gathering of global business and political leaders.
Hours after Annan's speech, Attorney General John Ashcroft said the "entirety of the world community" was needed to eliminate terrorism and establish freedom in Iraq.
Ashcroft also called for a global effort in rebuilding Iraq, acknowledging that the U.S.-led coalition was facing problems. "It's not easy to establish freedom in the midst of terror," he said. "Freedom has never been free."
