Scholars and critics say government has radically reinterpreted what it means to be material witness when investigation is into terrorism; say people being held as material witnesses in terrorism cases are often not called to testify against others, but instead they are often charged with crimes themselves; say they lack constitutional protections like being read Miranda rights; say they are often held for long periods in same harsh. conditions as those suspected of very serious crimes; former US Atty Mary Jo White, who supervised several major terrorism investigations in Manhattan until she resigned in 2002, says frequent and aggressive use of material witness law in terrorism investigations is recent development; says she used it herself, but that it must be used judiciously; says some of criticism that has been leveled is not wholly unjustified; senior Justice Dept official, citing sensitivity of. terrorism investigations, dismisses criticism; Abdullah al Kidd, American citizen arrested in Washington, DC, as material witness in Mar 2003, never charged with crime and never asked to testify as witness, then released 16 months later, describes what he calls his most terrifying and humiliating ordeal; Human Rights Watch and American Civil Liberties Union have identified 57 similar cases; photo; chart.
