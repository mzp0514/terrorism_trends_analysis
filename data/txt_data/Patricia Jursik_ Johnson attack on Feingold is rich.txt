Dear Editor: It is really quite rich to see Sen. Ron Johnson attack Russ Feingold regarding terrorism and Feingold's lone "No" vote on the Patriot Act. I agree with Feingold when accusing Johnson of "politicizing terrorism and national security." One need only recall Johnson joining some 40 other Republican senators in signing and sending a letter to the government of Iran during the nuclear arms negotiation with Iran and encouraging our nemesis not to sign any agreement negotiated by the Obama administration.
While interfering with the actions of a duly elected president (dare I say treasonous act?), Johnson felt it was more patriotic to work against reducing nuclear weapons and putting party over country, endangering this peace accord to reduce nuclear proliferation. Johnson is clearly a hawk and his extreme record also shows that our current senator is willing to play politics any time his party finds it in their economic interest to do so.
