Justice Ginsburg laid to rest: ARLINGTON, Va. — Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was buried Tuesday in a private ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, laid to rest beside her husband and near some of her former colleagues on the court. Washington last week honored the 87-year-old Ginsburg, who died Sept. 
18. Arlington, just over the Potomac River from Washington, is best known as the resting place of approximately 400,000 service members, veterans and family members. But Ginsburg is the 14th justice to be buried at the cemetery. Kuwait ruler dies at age 91: DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah, the ruler of Kuwait who drew on his decades as the oil-rich nation's top diplomat to push for closer ties to Iraq after the 1990 Gulf War and solutions to other regional crises, died Tuesday. He was 91. Owner, regulators blamed in crash: ALBANY, N.Y. — State regulators repeatedly failed to properly oversee a poorly maintained stretch limousine with corroded brakes that hurtled down a hill at more than 100 mph and crashed in a ravine, killing 20 people, federal investigators said Tuesday. National Transportation Safety Board members unanimously voted to accept a final report that found widespread fault in the 2018 crash in upstate New York. French arrest 29, cite jihadist links: PARIS — French police arrested 29 people around the country on Tuesday in a vast operation to break a complex scheme financing Islamist extremists in Syria through the use of cryptocurrencies. A statement from the anti-terrorism prosecutor's office said search warrants are out for the two main figures in the scheme, French jihadis who have likely been in northwest Syria since 2013 and are suspected of creating "the architecture of this network of terrorism financing." The 29 people detained for questioning Tuesday are aged 22 to 66.
