Terrorism calendar: Stocking suffer?
NEW YORK (AP) - Some people might prefer a lump of coal.
The International Association for Counterterrorism & Security Professionals unveiled its 1999 Terrorism Anniversaries Calendar on Tuesday.
The glossy color calendar has pictures commemorating infamous dates like the Oct. 23, 1983, suicide truck bombing of the Marine barracks in Lebanon, and the July 27, 1996, bombing of Olympic Park in Atlanta.
The calendar features staged photos of black-clad government soldiers dodging fiery explosions and blasting away with high-tech, automatic rifles. The cover is a gloomy shot of the World Trade Center's twin towers with a police barricade.
The calendar is the brainchild of Long Island University professor Harvey Kushner, who doubles as a consultant for various government agencies.
"We need to know about terrorism to fight it," he said.
NORTH MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP) - Civic leaders are putting a little distance between body piercing parlors and tourists.
The idea is that an impulsive person, especially an impulsive young person, is less likely to have a body part pierced if the person has to hike to the piercer.
"A lot of people are spontaneous about things," said Councilman Terry White Sr. The City Council voted Monday to send any new piercing shops to an area outside the main tourist center.
But J. Michael Hill, president of the American Body Art Association, said the move won't do much good.
Hill, whose 250-member group is based in Kingsport, Tenn., said many piercings and tattoos occur on the spur of the moment, but most folks plan in advance.
