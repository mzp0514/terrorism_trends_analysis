A baton-brandishing cop faced off against a small army of aggressive subway vagrants, never pulling his gun - in a viral video (below) that's been viewed more than a million times on Twitter.
"Stand back! Stand back!" the officer yells as a group of men square off against him on the East Broadway F train stop in Lower Manhattan. One of those who lunged at him fell to the tracks.
The melee started Sunday night while the officer was working solo in a counter-terrorism "Omega" post in the subway station, police said. A woman approached him and said the men were harassing her.
When the officer confronted the vagrants, he found one of them laid out on the platform, intoxicated, police said. 
When the cop told the men they needed to leave, the vagrants "approached him aggressively," a police source said. "He took action and gained control of the situation."
As someone films from behind the cop, one of the men steps forward. The officer kicked him, sending him lurching to the ground.
"Step back! I don't want to hurt you!" the officer yells as a second man approaches. He kicked that man down as well. But he got up, and the the video shows the officer swinging his baton to hold him off.The cop was uninjured, and when backup arrived, police took five men into custody. All were processed as intoxicated emotionally disturbed persons and hospitalized.
Amazingly, all five men returned to the same station after they were discharged, sources said.
That end of the East Broadway F stop is a magnet for homeless people who often gather to get high, police sources said.
