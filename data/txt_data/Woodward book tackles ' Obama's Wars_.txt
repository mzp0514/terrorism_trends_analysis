NEW YORK - Less than three weeks before publication, Bob Woodward's new book finally has a cover design and a title: "Obama's Wars." And the focus will not be on the economy - the top issue of the fall elections - but on foreign policy. Woodward's latest investigative work will run 441 pages (Amazon.com had been listing the count at 464 pages) and show Obama "making the critical decisions on the Afghanistan War, the secret war in Pakistan and the worldwide fight against terrorism," Simon & Schuster announced. Woodward finished three weeks ago, according to an official with knowledge of the book. The official, who said the book includes little on the Iraq conflict, was not authorized to discuss "Obama's Wars" and asked not to be identified. Now an associate editor at The Washington Post, Woodward teamed in the 1970s with fellow Post reporter Carl Bernstein on the paper's Pulitzer Prize-winning coverage of the Watergate scandal. He has written 16 books and remains known for his incredible access to White House information. Woodward's four best sellers on the George W. Bush administration also concentrated on foreign policy and the war on terrorism. As with his previous works, Woodward will draw upon internal memos, documents and interviews with key decision makers, including Obama.
