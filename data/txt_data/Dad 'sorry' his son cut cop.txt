The father of a Brooklyn man accused of knifing a cop in the neck before he was shot by responding officers apologized for his son's actions Friday.
"I am sorry this is happening," Dzenan Camovic's father told the Daily News as he left his Flatbush home Friday, refusing to speak about the bloody scene sparked by his son Wednesday night.
Camovic, 20, was walking near the corner of Flatbush Ave. and Church Ave. when he crept up and slashed Officer Yayonfrant Jean Pierre in the neck in what Mayor de Blasio called an "absolutely unprovoked attack."
Camovic (inset) grabbed the cop's partner's gun in the ensuing struggle before getting shot by two other cops racing to the scene. Officers fired 22 times, striking Camovic eight times and critically wounding him.
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said Thursday it wasn't clear if Camovic actually fired at police. Friendly fire has not been ruled out, officials said.
Officer Jean Pierre and two cops who were wounded in the hail of bullets were all hospitalized with minor injuries.
No criminal charges have been filed yet against Camovic, who is also being investigated for possible links to terrorism.
Camovic has no criminal history, but the federal Joint Terrorism Task Force is investigating the Bosnian immigrant's background and whether he is linked to ISIS or other terror groups, sources said.
