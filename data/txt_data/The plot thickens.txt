There's no doubt Wade Michael Page, the skinhead sicko who did the world a favor by executing himself after murdering six people at a Sikh temple, was a racist hatemonger. But was he a terrorist? That's not so clear. Nevertheless, authorities immediately launched an investigation into whether his rampage qualified as a case of "domestic terrorism."
Yet as numerous others have pointed out, Nidal Malik Hasan'srampage at Fort Hood, Texas -- in which the Islamic radical shouted "Allahu Akbar" as he opened fire -- quickly was labeled an incident of "workplace violence." A double standard seems to be in effect.
Of course, Hasan worked at Fort Hood. Maybe that's the difference?
Apparently not. Hasan is not the only soldier to have targeted the Texas installation. A few days ago, Pfc. Jason Naser Abdo, who had been stationed in Kentucky, was sentenced for plotting to blow up a restaurant full of soldiers at Fort Hood. The plot was "part of his religious mission," as NPR put it.
What religion? What mission? NPR doesn't say. But The Washington Post reports Abdo had spent "a lot of time at the Dallas Central Mosque." Zachari Klawonn, a former Army specialist who serves as the Military Religious Freedom Foundation's liaison with Muslims in the military, told The Post he found Abdo "very anti-American, anti-Western, anti-Army." Abdo himself claimed to seek freedom through "martyrdom."
So far no one has classified Abdo's plot as a case of domestic terrorism, either.
