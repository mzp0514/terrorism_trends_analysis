Terrorism expert Randy Larsen said Wednesday that the nation remains vulnerable to terrorist attacks but is moving in the right direction.
Larsen made the comments during a visit to Scott Air Force Base, where he spoke to the U.S. Transportation Command staff about terrorism and homeland security.
He is director of the Institute for Homeland Security at ANSER, a nonprofit research institute in Washington.
Twenty years ago, anti-terrorism planning was done in Washington and overseas, Larsen said. "Now it takes place in Belleville, Mascoutah and Fairview Heights."
Although the president and lawmakers are working to strengthen homeland security, "the federal government is not going to solve all your problems," Larsen cautioned. "Neither is the Department of Defense, including the National Guard."
He recommends careful planning at the state, local and family level.
Disasters are local events, and terrorists aim for easy targets, Larsen said. And the United States is still a "target-rich environment," he added.
He said the nation has 102 nuclear plants with 68 on navigable waterways, approachable by boat.
The country has 200,000 private airplanes, any one of which could carry a bomb, he added. Even so, Larsen sees more reason for optimism than fear.
Concerns should be kept in perspective, he said. Statistically, he believes the chance of being hurt by a drunken driver is far greater than being hurt by a terrorist.
