(RTTNews) - Tuesday, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a newly-negotiated version of the Kerry-Lugar Pakistan aid bill that would triple the non-military aid to Pakistan to USD 7.5 billion in the next five years, reports say.
The Bicameral Legislation Increasing Assistance to Pakistan comes with riders demanding Islamabad take strong counter-terrorism measures and prevent attacks on the West and its neighbors like India.
The Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act (S 1701), having the backing of the entire Obama administration, triples U.S. democratic, economic, and social development assistance to the Islamic nation to USD 1.5 billion a year from fiscal years 2010 to 2014.
The voice vote came a week after Senate approved the measure through a process known as "Unanimous Consent"--where the Senate doesn&apos;t actually vote on the bill, but nobody raises any objections, so it goes through--to pass the measure.
The bicameral legislation now goes to U.S. President Barack Obama for his signature.
Against the House version conditioning the release of military assistance on the president&apos;s certification that the Islamabad "demonstrated a sustained commitment to and made progress towards combating terrorist groups," the compromise version simply states that the president has to report annually that the Islamic nation is "making significant efforts towards combating terrorist groups ... including taking into account the extent to which it has made progress on matters" related to counter-terrorism.
