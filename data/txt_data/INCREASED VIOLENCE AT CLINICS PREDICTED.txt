An abortion rights activist and a local physician, both reeling in the wake of the Wednesday murder of a Florida doctor who performs abortions, called for increased measures to halt ''terrorism'' at abortion clinics.
Anne Gaylor of the Women's Medical Fund Gaylor, which funds abortions for indigent women, said a woman should be able to exercise her constitutional right to an abortion without being terrorized.

''This is a medical problem and these women are so vulnerable,'' she said and called for those opposed to abortion rights to demonstrate anywhere they want ''but stay away from the medical facilities.''
Dr. Elizabeth Karlin, who has performed abortions in Madison for more than two years, agreed.
''I think the main problem with terrorism is that it has been allowed to grow in increments. First it was walking, then screaming, touching people, blocking, then they started putting children in front of moving cars in order to halt entrance to abortion facilities.''
She said she and her staff are very frightened ''and they should be. (But) I believe if something happened to me, there would be somebody to take over.''
Ralph Ovadal, a Monroe-area farmer and opponent of abortion rights who ran for the Legislature last year, said by telephone from northern Wisconsin Thursday that he could not condone the action of the person accused of fatally shooting the Florida doctor, but neither would he condemn it.
''The person he shot was just yards away from going in and taking a dozen other lives,'' said Ovadal, who has been arrested at more than 100 abortion protests.
''I think we're heading for some escalating violence,'' he added, ''and that scares me.''
