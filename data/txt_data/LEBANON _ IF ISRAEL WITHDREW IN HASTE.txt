To the Editor:
 Your editorial recommendation (Jan. 26) to return Dr. Kissinger to the Middle East negotiations coincided with the 10th anniversary of the Paris peace agreement. Perhaps we can learn something from the coincidence.

he total failure and defeat that followed so soon after the Paris agreement was no doubt caused by the hasty withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam, a withdrawal prompted by domestic political expediency. President Nixon was interested in a cosmetic agreement, the appearance of peace without regard to the predictable consequence: a vacuum that would attract all the hostile elements that had caused the war to begin with.
In Lebanon today, Dr. Kissinger would face the same predicament.  Any pressure on Israel for hasty withdrawal from that country, so long torn by internal strife supported by its Arab neighbors, would predictably lead to bringing back all the forces of violence and terrorism which Israel, to everyone's relief, had helped to remove decisively.
The memory of the Vietnam debacle should teach us that long-range goals of peace are not served by appeasing the forces of violence and terrorism, nor by giving in to momentary political expediency.  Our long-range interests in the Middle East coincide with those of Israel.  MANFRED R. LEHMANN Nairobi, Kenya, Feb. 1, 1983
