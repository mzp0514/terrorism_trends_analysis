You jolt awake, trembling, in the middle of the night with that recurring nightmare.
The bad guys have penetrated Pentagon computers. They now control the instructions for the U.S. nuclear arsenal and are holding the world for ransom.
Unless their demands are met within 24 hours, destruction will rain down on Washington, New York, Paris and London.
Is this just the fevered imagination of juvenile Hollywood scriptwriters? Or are defense planners justified in seeking to spend huge sums to combat a compelling danger?
According to experts interviewed by Reuters, you can relax. The threat is more Hollywood than hard fact.
Some experts say companies trying to sell the latest security software are exploiting these fears.
Others say governments, worried by the prospect of falling tax revenues as more business is transacted on the Internet, are happy to play along. If the fear of terrorism can be played up, governments would have an excuse to grab more power to pry into and regulate Internet commerce.
Movies such as Sneakers, in which a hacker played by Robert Redford steals a decoding device that can break into any computer in the world, have planted in audiences the notion that there is a serious danger.
Some defense planners and parts of the media have joined in, suggesting that the United States and Western nations need to protect themselves from the potentially devastating peril that cyber-warfare poses.
This assumes that terrorists or rogue states can - in theory and relatively cheaply - crank up a computer-based campaign against superpowers and win by using cyber-warfare.
"Theoretical. That's the right word," said Peter Sommer, senior research fellow at the London School of Economics.
Getting into and manipulating networks pose awesome problems, according to Sommer.
"To hit a major network, you need to know how it works, what backup there is. You need a great deal of information," he said.
"You would need to infiltrate someone into the organization. They would need to know how to write code and introduce it onto the system. I'm not saying it cannot be done, but for quick effect it may be better just to place a bomb."
Andrew Rathmell, of the International Centre for Security Analysis at King's College in London, said military sites present a difficult target for terrorists. But so-called information-warfare techniques could, in theory, inflict great damage on civilian infrastructures such as power grids, rail and air transport, as well as telecommunications.
Rathmell said financial systems were well-protected, but because of increasing interdependency, the effect of damage to infrastructure was difficult to predict.
"Infrastructure attacks could have an effect like strategic bombing. You no longer need to go through armed forces to attack civilians. You can go in under the wire," Rathmell said.
"But what can they really do? It's all pretty improbable. Key systems to launch nuclear weapons, key communications in the White House are pretty well hardened and protected. Only a really switched-on secret service could penetrate that," Rathmell said.
Ross Anderson, of Cambridge University's computer laboratory, also doubted the power of this threat, despite President Clinton's call to arms against cyber-terrorism, made on May 22.
"Information warfare seems to be a marketing exercise rather than anything else. It's the computer-security community trying to increase sales to the federal government," Anderson said.
He believes the government's plan to seek "mandatory key escrow" in the name of protection against computer crime is a sneaky way of imposing control over citizens' privacy.
"Mandatory key escrow" means that citizens protecting their electronic business with encrypted computer code would have to provide government regulators with keys to that code.
"Governments are trying to get control over electronic commerce," Anderson said.
What of perennial stories in newspapers that another 16-year-old has hacked into the Pentagon's computers?
Sommer dismissed the danger. The incidents happened only to insecure networks on old computers.
"You must remember that the U.S. military has over two million computers which are mostly insignificant. Most secure systems are isolated," Sommer said.
