To the Editor:
According to a Feb. 3 news report, William S. Sessions, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, justified the bureau's years of investigation of the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador. The committee had been accused, he said, of supplying funds to the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the Salvadoran rebel organization, whose terrorist activities ''included bombings, kidnappings, assaults and assassinations.''
The accusation of support did not prove true.
The contra rebels whom the United States supports and directs in Nicaragua have been guilty of bombings, kidnappings, assaults and assassinations. On Feb. 4, you report that in a 2:30 A.M. mortar bombing of a farm cooperative, the contras, who generally attack ''soft targets,'' rather than military establishments, killed eight people, including a woman and three children. Many civilians have also been killed by land mines planted by the contras on main roads.
On Feb. 9, you reported that despite the vote against contra aid in Congress, Senators Bob Dole and John McCain had sent money to the contras' private fund, according to rebel leaders, and that the Iran-contra principal Maj. Gen. John K. Singlaub was prepared to assure aid to the contras in the field without control over their activities. This aid, presumably, will not require F.B.I. investigation.
Terrorism is not terrorism when it is an instrument of American foreign policy, and civilian deaths do not count when ''freedom fighters'' cause them.
