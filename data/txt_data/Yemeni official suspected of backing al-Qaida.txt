SAN'A, Yemen (AP) - Yemen's powerful Islamic political party replaced a top leader Tuesday whom Washington suspects of funding terrorism and supporting al-Qaida.
Islah voted out Sheik Abdulmajid al-Zindani, the spiritual leader of the party, and replaced him with Mohammed Ali Ajilan, a Yemeni parliament member.
Last February, President Bush asked Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh to arrest al-Zindani because of suspected links to terrorism. U.S. officials have accused him of actively recruiting for al-Qaida's training camps and helping purchase weapons for terrorists.
Al-Zindani, who also is president of the Islamic Al-Iman University, regarded as a haven for radicals, has denied the allegations and called on the U.S. to produce evidence.
Believed to be Osama bin Laden's spiritual mentor, al-Zindani has incited hate against the West and come close to advocating violence in his sermons.
Yemen has said repeatedly that it will not hand him, or any other Yemeni, over to Washington.
During the three-day Islah conference, its members also urged the government to pressure Washington into removing al-Zindani's name from its list of suspected terrorism financiers.
Yemen, the ancestral homeland of bin Laden, has been an active participant in the U.S.-led war on terrorism.
