Tidewater Barge Lines of Vancouver is getting nearly $ 8,600 in federal anti-terrorism money to help pay for a study of security at its operations on the Columbia and Snake rivers.
The grant from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is part of some $ 16 million that will go from the federal agency to various companies and governments in Washington state to enhance security at ports.
Other grants include nearly $ 7 million each to the Port of Seattle and to the state ferry system, $ 160,000 to Tesoro Refining and Marketing Co. of Anacortes, and $ 100,000 to the Port of Port Angeles.
Tidewater, which carries petroleum, grain and other commodities up the Columbia and Snake rivers, had begun its system-wide assessment even before winning the grant, company President Steve Frasher said Tuesday. The object is to ensure that Tidewater operations are in compliance with new Coast Guard post-9/11guidelines.
Tidewater has hired Corporate Security Services of Vancouver (www. corpsecure. com) to conduct the study of Tidewater's on-board operations and terminals in Vancouver; Boardman, Ore.; Pasco; and Wilma, near Clarkston.
For example, Frasher said, Corporate Security Services will determine if the terminals are secure and how well the employees are trained to watch for and prevent various terrorism-related situations.
John Posey, president of Corporate Security Services, said his firm's clients also include Alaska Airlines, Kaiser Permanente, the Bonneville Power Administration and Nortel Networks.
