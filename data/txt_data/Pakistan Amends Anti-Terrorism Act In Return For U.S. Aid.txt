(RTTNews) - Pakistan has amended presidential ordinances of the Anti-Terrorism Act, raising the period for keeping terror suspects in custody for interrogation to 90 days.
President Asif Ali Zardari made the amendment with immediate effect, media reports say.
Currently, the duration of remand is restricted to 30 days. As per the amendment, those providing logistic and financial support and directly or indirectly involved in any terrorist activity would be treated as terrorists. They would be punished under provisions applicable to terrorists who execute terrorist activities.
The amended ordinance says that those providing information about the targets, their residence and transport, would also be considered as terrorists - a provision that could discourage civilians from helping the security forces in anti-terrorist operations.
Bail conditions to release suspects, arrested on the charges of terrorism, have been further tightened.
Correspondents say that the amendment is one of the conditions agreed by Pakistan in a recent bill passed by the US Congress, which triples non-military aid to Pakistan.
The Kerry-Lugar bill provides an annual outlay of $1.5bn for five years.
Under the bill, the US will certify that Pakistan is working to dismantle its nuclear proliferation networks.
According to local media, Islamabad was required to strengthen its counter-terrorism and anti-money laundering laws.
