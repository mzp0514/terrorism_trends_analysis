WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The House of Representatives this week passed three bipartisan bills co-sponsored by Congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema (AZ-09) to increase sanctions and cut off funds to Iran and the Hizballah foreign terrorist organization.
Terrorist networks constantly develop new ways to finance their deadly operations, and Hizballah continues to be a significant threat to the United States and our allies, said Congresswoman Sinema. Money is the lifeblood of any organization. These bipartisan bills are important tools to combat terrorist financing and protect America‘s safety and security.
The House of Representatives passed the Iran Ballistic Missiles and International Sanctions Enforcement Act (H.R. 1698), Sanctioning Hizballah's Illicit Use of Civilians as Defenseless Shields Act (H.R. 3342), and Hizballah International Financing Prevention Amendments Act (H.R. 3329), all co-sponsored by Congresswoman Sinema.
Congresswoman Sinema serves on the House Financial Services‘ Terrorism and Illicit Finance subcommittee. In August, the President signed into law the Countering America‘s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (H.R. 3364), which included legislation sponsored by Congresswoman Sinema to establish a whole-of-government strategy to combat terrorism financing.
Yesterday, the House of Representatives passed legislation co-sponsored by Congresswoman Sinema to implement new sanctions on North Korea.
