Editor, New Era:
I am an American. I am a working American. I am a taxpaying American, and I am a proud American. I am a father. I am a pilot. I am an avid promoter of my freedoms, my beliefs and my rights.

As an American, I take great offense to a party that represents American values as fear and uncertainty. I can't sit by as an American and have someone tell me that my right to vote for the candidate I see fit is a vote for terrorism.
I can't think of one other administration that has presented such a fog over its own policies in an effort to confuse Americans and instill fear in Americans to win its re-election.
I consider it terrorism when someone insights fear and uncertainty in my decisions and my beliefs, when my "homeland rights" are being taken away in the "war against terror" without a single terrorist being put through our judicial system.
I consider it terrorism when people stand up in office and tell me that my vote, my beliefs and my freedoms that Americans are fighting for are wrong - and a vote for terrorism.
What kind of an America do we live in when my freedoms to be the American I value are the freedoms the Bush administration wants to divide Americans on? We are supposed to unite, stand tall and fight for our rights and freedoms, not be blind to them. As an American, I will cast my vote for the fellow American I feel will do best for America, for the world and for peace.
I vote for America, not for terror. I vote based on credibility and issues, not commercials. You can't swing me with fear, only with dignity! It's time for Americans to be united under our constitutional beliefs, our Bill of Rights and the liberties our veterans have fought so hard to achieve.  Byron Miller Manheim Township
