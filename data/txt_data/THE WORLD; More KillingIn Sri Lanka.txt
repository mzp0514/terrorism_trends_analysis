In Sri Lanka, an island country of 15 million people near the southern tip of India, the Sinhalese majority and the Tamil minority do not speak the same language. Last week, their linguistic, ethnic and religious differences were exacerbated by Tamil terrorism and army reprisals in a revival of violence that took hundreds of lives last year.
Officials said 95 people, including a dozen soldiers, had been killed in the last two weeks. They confirmed that soldiers, angered by a guerrilla ambush last weekend, burned more than 100 shops in the northern, Tamil town of Mannar. The Government blamed leftists in the army (which is predominantly Sinhalese).
The Roman Catholic Bishop of Mannar, Thomas Sundanayam, disagreed. ''Police and army are harassing innocent people,'' he said. ''They are as brutal and beastly as ever.'' Mindful of the sensitivities of 55 million Tamils living in southern India, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi said, ''The killing of innocent people in Sri Lanka is highly shocking.''
Most Tamil guerrilla groups want a separate Tamil country. The largest Tamil political party, which campaigned for separatism in 1977 elections, now says it is open to other solutions. Under pressure from the mainly Sinhalese Buddhist clergy and opposition politicians, the Government pulled back from a proposal for regional autonomy that it had submitted to an all-party conference. Instead, the Government offered greater Tamil representation in a proposed second house of Parliament. The body would not deal with security and ethnic issues, Tamil politicians noted as they rejected it.
