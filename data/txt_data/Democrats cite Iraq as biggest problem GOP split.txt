Among registered voters who chose the war as their top issue, 68 percent say they would vote for the Democrat in their district while 26 percent said they would vote for the Republican.
The problem mentioned most often by all the adults polled was the war - in Iraq and conflicts in general - 22 percent; economy at 14 percent; immigration and political leaders at 9 percent; the energy crisis at 8 percent and terrorism at 7 percent.
