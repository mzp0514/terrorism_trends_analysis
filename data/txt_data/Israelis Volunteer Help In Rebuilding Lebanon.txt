A grass-roots Israeli volunteer movement to help repair the war ravages in neighboring Lebanon started today.  Dozens of people telephoned the state radio station in Jerusalem to say that they wanted to cross the border to rebuild wrecked homes.
TEL AVIV, June 13 - A grass-roots Israeli volunteer movement to help repair the war ravages in neighboring Lebanon started today.
The callers were responding to a remark in a radio interview last night by Amnon Rubinstein, an opposition Member of Parliament, who said that for humanitarian, moral and political reasons, the Israeli Government should take the lead in organizing an international campaign to help Lebanese who had lost their homes in the war.
''They, too, are victims of terrorism,'' he said, ''not less than Israelis.'' Listeners began calling in, and a radio announcer said that women in Jerusalem and Rishon le Zion had formed local committees to collect clothing. Callers included a group of psychologists offering to work with Lebanese children.
Abie Nathan, a philanthropist who has devoted the profits from a radio station to international charities, announced that he had bought $8,000 worth of chocolate from a local factory at a discount price for distribution to Lebanese children.
