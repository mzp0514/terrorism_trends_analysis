WASHINGTON (AP) - In explaining the U.S. missile strikes in
Afghanistan and Sudan, Clinton administration officials were careful
to caution against thinking this was the final salvo in the war
against global terrorism.
If, as Joint Chiefs Chairman Hugh Shelton said, this is a new kind of
warfare, can the U.S. military win? Can it stop terrorists from
hitting Americans at home?
If U.S. forces are prepared, as Undersecretary of State Thomas
Pickering said Friday, to use any means at their disposal in this
intensified war against terrorism, what means - chemical, biological
or other - might the terrorist groups be ready to use? use? use?
Such questions cannot be answered with certainty. But what does seem
likely is that the war on terror will take a further toll on Americans
somewhere.
"We should expect future attacks against Americans, whether at home or
abroad," Robert Gates, a former CIA director, said Friday. "This is a
protracted conflict."
President Clinton said when he announced Thursday's missile attacks
that Americans must realize "this will be a long, ongoing struggle
between freedom and fanaticism."
The United States and its interests abroad have been a target of
terrorists for years. What has changed now is the nature of the
terrorist threat. Instead of relying on individual states such as Iran
or Syria for financial support, terrorists now use "transnational"
networks not tied to any specific nation, either for resources or for
ideology.
"You're talking about a privatization of international terrorism,"
said Vincent Cannistraro, a former National Security Council
intelligence director and terrorism expert.
As the nature of terrorism has changed, the U.S. national security
establishment has been slow to adapt. With the Cold War over, ending
the threat of a huge land war in Europe, U.S. military forces have
been reshaped. But the closer coordination needed between the
military, intelligence and law enforcement agencies to pre-empt and
defeat terrorism has sometimes been lacking, experts generally agree.
Roy Godson, a terrorism expert and president of the National Strategy
Information Center in Washington, applauds Clinton's decision to use
force. But he urges a broader approach. Moderate Muslim leaders, for
example, should be given more help - financial and otherwise - in
their political struggles against the radicals, he said.
Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile and Islamic militant whose terrorist
network was the target of the U.S. missile strikes against his
training camps in Afghanistan and a chemical plant in Sudan, has
declared his intention to carry out a terrorist war against America.
In his speech to the nation on Thursday, Clinton said bin Laden had
vowed to kill Americans and did not care if they were civilians or
soldiers. The president said U.S. intelligence had determined that one
of bin Laden's groups was behind the Aug. 7 embassy bombings in Kenya
and Tanzania that killed 263 people, including 12 Americans.
The embassy bombings, Clinton said, were not the beginning of this
terrorism war, and the retaliatory U.S. strikes on Thursday were not
the end. "No matter how long it may take," he said, the United States
must be willing to fight back at every turn. Implicit in his message
was a warning that Americans are particularly vulnerable.  vulnerable.  vulnerable.
