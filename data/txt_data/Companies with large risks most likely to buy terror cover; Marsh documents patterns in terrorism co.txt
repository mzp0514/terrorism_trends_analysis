The number of companies buying terrorism insurance rose slightly in the second quarter of 2004 as rates for the coverage stabilized, though buying patterns differed markedly by size of company, industry and region of the country, according to a Marsh Inc. survey.
Overall, 46.2% of 807 surveyed companies bought terrorism coverage while renewing property programs in the second quarter, up marginally from 44.2% in the first quarter but nearly double the 23.5% that bought the coverage in the second quarter of 2003, Marsh found.
Companies with total insured property values between $500 million and $1 billion were the most-frequent buyers, with 67.9% opting for terrorism coverage in the second quarter, up from 45.8% in the first quarter. By contrast, only 44.2% of companies with more than $1 billion in values bought the coverage in the second quarter, down from 63.0% in the previous quarter. Marsh cautioned that it could not easily attribute the differences to one factor but noted that median premium rates fell for the $500 million to $1 billion group between quarters while rates for the larger-value group rose.
Energy companies were the least likely to buy terrorism insurance, with 17.9% opting for the cover in the second quarter. Public entities and real estate companies, on the other hand, were the biggest buyers, with 70.0% and 69.2%, respectively, opting for the cover, Marsh found.
Companies located in the Northeast were the most-frequent buyers by region, with 59.7% purchasing coverage in the second quarter. Midwestern companies followed, with 57.9% taking the coverage, while 37.8% of companies in the West buying coverage and 28.2% of those in the South.
Overall property insurance pricing is falling faster than terrorism coverage pricing, meaning that terrorism coverage now represents a larger portion of total property premiums, especially for those companies increasing terrorism limits, the Marsh survey notes.
Median terrorism rates fell slightly in the second quarter, to 0.0076% of total insured values from 0.0080% in the first quarter, Marsh found.  While rates in 2004 are up from the levels of the third and fourth quarters of 2003, they are almost unchanged from the 0.0078% median rate in the second quarter of 2003.
Construction companies are paying the highest rates, a median 0.0303% in the second quarter, while health care and education companies are paying the lowest rate, 0.0036%, the survey found.
Copies of the survey are available by contacting Marsh offices, a directory of which is available at www.marsh.com.
