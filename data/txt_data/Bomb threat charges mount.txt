Dec. 21--A Catawba County man now faces more than 770 charges in a spree of several hundred bomb threats made in three counties this past spring and summer.
Cody Matthew Startt, 27, was charged this week in Burke County with 253 felony counts each of terrorism and making false bomb reports. He also has been indicted in Caldwell County on 68 counts each of terrorism and making false bomb reports, and in Catawba County on 65 counts of terrorism, 64 counts of making false bomb reports and three counts of probation violation.
When Startt was arrested in early July in Matoaka, West Virginia, investigators said that at least 400 bomb threats had been made throughout Caldwell, Catawba and Burke counties during the previous seven weeks.
Startt had been on probation since October 2015, when he was convicted on three counts of making false bomb reports in May 2015.
After his arrest Startt admitted to violating terms of his probation by fleeing supervision, being behind in court-ordered payments and failing to complete court-ordered community service. His probation was revoked and he was ordered serve four to 14 months in prison.
Startt is scheduled for a hearing in Caldwell Superior Court on Jan. 9 and in Burke Superior Court on Feb. 13. Information about his Catawba County court date was not immediately available.
