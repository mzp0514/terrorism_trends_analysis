A Senate judiciary subcommittee accused a Texas lawyer today of plotting with Robert L. Vesco, the fugitive financier, in an alleged multimillion-dollar bribery plot on behalf of the Libyan Government.
The lawyer, James Day of Brookshire, Tex., appeared before the panel for more than two hours but declined to answer any questions.
Senate judiciary subcommittee accuses James Day, Texan lawyer, of plotting with Robert Vesco in alleged multimillion-dollar bribery plot concerning Libyan GovernmentSenator Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona, the subcommittee chairman, asserted that the arrangement involved an attempt to bribe the Democratic national chairman, John C. White, to use his influence to persuade the Carter Administration to release military transport planes to Libya. The Administration has refused to provide the planes because of Libyan support of terrorism.
Mr. White has said he has no knowledge of any bribery plot. A Federal grand jury in New York has been investigating the matter since last year.
The subcommittee played a taped conversation that it said had been supplied by Mr. Vesco of a meeting between him and Mr. Day at which they purportedly discussed $11 million in payoffs to attempt to bribe officials.
