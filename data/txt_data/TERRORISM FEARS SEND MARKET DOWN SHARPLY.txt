Growing fearful of terror attacks, investors opted for safety yesterday, securing profits and sending stocks sharply lower for a second day. The market's uneasiness wiped out early gains prompted by better-than-expected retail earnings and a settlement for Merrill Lynch.
 Analysts said the pullback, although expected since last week's big rally, was exacerbated by fears of more attacks. Wall Street's losses widened late yesterday after the FBI warned New York law enforcement officials of an uncorroborated threat of terrorism involving such landmarks as the Statue of Liberty and the Brooklyn Bridge.
"It's more of the geopolitical fears. Most of the corporate news is positive. The retail stores beat expectations, and so the consumer is still in the market. â€¦ But there's lot of rhetoric about the next terrorism attack. When it will be and where?" said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co.
 The technology sector registered the biggest drop, having enjoyed the biggest surge last week. The Nasdaq composite index closed down 37.41 at 1,664.18. Combined with Monday's 39.80-point decline, the Nasdaq has lost more than half of last week's advance of 140.54.
 The market's other major indexes also slid. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 123.79 to 10,105.71. The Dow added to Monday's 123-point drop, now having lost more than half of last week's gain of 413.16.
 The Standard & Poor's 500 index sank 12.00 to 1,079.88.
 Retailing shares fell, despite a string of better-than-expected first-quarter earnings that included those of Home Depot and Target.
 Home Depot sank $3.60, or 7.4 percent, to $44.90 as its shares were downgraded by A.G. Edwards to "hold" from "buy." Target fell $1.16 to $41.54.
 Declining issues outnumbered advancers nearly 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume was light at 1.47 billion shares, but ahead of Monday's 1.22 billion shares. The Russell 2000 index fell 7.71 to 495.46.
