NEWARK, N.J. - The latest on a Washington state man accused of terrorism for allegedly killing a New Jersey college student last year (all times local).
12:15 p.m.
A Washington state man charged with a terrorism count for allegedly killing a New Jersey college student last year over U.S. policy in the Middle East wore ear plugs to a court hearing.
Ali Muhammad Brown was flanked by 10 sheriff's office deputies for his status hearing Wednesday. He refused to take part in the proceedings, which he has said he did not want to attend.
His lawyer told a judge that he still wants to get some more evidence and plans to file some motions in the case. But the lawyer would not say if he would seek to have the charges dismissed.
In an unrelated matter, Brown received a 36 1/2-year sentence Wednesday for a robbery conviction.

2 a.m.
A Washington state man accused of terrorism for allegedly killing a New Jersey college student last year over the United States' policy in the Middle East is set to make a court appearance.
Ali Muhammad Brown has a status hearing scheduled for Wednesday.
The charges against the 30-year-old Brown include the first-ever terrorism counts filed under New Jersey's law.
Brown also faces murder counts in Washington stemming from the June deaths of two men killed in Seattle after they left a gay nightclub.
Brown, who has refused to leave his jail cell, was convicted of robbery in an unrelated case in New Jersey last year. His sentencing in that case also is scheduled for Wednesday in Essex County.
