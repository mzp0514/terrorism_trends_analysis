A federal jury Thursday began deliberating whether three men devised a scheme to blow up U.S. airliners in Asia last year.
Judge Kevin Duffy instructed jurors for more than four hours on the law as it applied to charges against Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, Abdul Hakim Murad and Wali Khan Amin Shah.
In a separate case, Yousef also is accused of being the mastermind of the World Trade Center bombing.
The 12 jurors met for only an hour Thursday before the judge let them recess until Tuesday.  Deportations top 1995
WASHINGTON - The government has deported more illegal immigrants this year than it did in all of 1995, the Immigration and Naturalization Service said Thursday.
In the first 10 months of fiscal 1996, the INS sent an estimated 54,362 noncitizens out of the country, 8 percent more than the 50,200 deported in fiscal 1995, INS General Counsel David Martin said. Illegal aliens convicted of committing crimes in this country totaled 29,207. The rest were noncriminal deportations, such as immigrants working at U.S. businesses.  Guards accused of thefts
UPPER MERION, Pa. - Three security guards at a shopping mall face burglary charges after being caught on videotape stealing 42 Barbie dolls from a toy store on their overnight watch.
The dolls, worth more than $ 2,000, were taken from the F.A.O. Schwartz store at the King of Prussia Plaza. Police said they found other stolen merchandise at the guards' homes.
