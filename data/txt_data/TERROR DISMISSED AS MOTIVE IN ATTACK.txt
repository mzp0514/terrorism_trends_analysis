 LONDON  - A Somali-Norwegian teenager went on a knife rampage through London's Russell Square, a hub for students and tourists, fatally stabbing an American woman from Florida and wounding five other people.
 Police said Thursday that it wasn't terrorism - but in a city on edge after a summer of attacks elsewhere in Europe, both authorities and London residents initially responded as if it were. Police flooded the streets with extra officers and mobilized counterterror detectives before saying the shocking burst of violence appeared to have been "triggered by mental-health issues."
 Police officers used a stun gun to subdue the 19-year-old suspect at the scene of the stabbings late Wednesday, among busy streets lined with hotels close to the British Museum.
 Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said "we have found no evidence of radicalization or anything that would suggest the man in our custody was in any way motivated by terrorism."
 He said detectives from the force's murder and terrorism squads had interviewed the suspect.
 "We believe this was a spontaneous attack and the victims were selected at random," Rowley said.
 Rowley said the suspect, whose name hasn't been released, is a Norwegian of Somali ancestry - though police don't consider that "relevant to the motivation for his actions."
 The Metropolitan Police identified the dead woman as 64-year-old Darlene Horton.
 Florida State University in Tallahassee said Horton was married to psychology professor Richard Wagner, who had been teaching summer classes in London.
