WASHINGTON -- A planned trip by former President George W. Bush to Switzerland this week has been canceled in the face of threatened large-scale protests and calls for an investigation into whether his administration committed human rights abuses in the fight against terrorism.
A spokesman for Mr. Bush said Saturday that the trip was canceled after the United Israel Appeal, an international Jewish charity organizing the Geneva event where he had been scheduled to speak next Saturday, told him Friday that it was canceling the speech because of security concerns.
"We regret that the speech has been canceled," said David Sherzer, a spokesman for Mr. Bush. "President Bush was looking forward to speaking about freedom and offering reflections from his time in office."
The visit to Geneva was to have been Mr. Bush's first trip to Europe since his memoir, "Decision Points," was published in November, and the first since he publicly stated in interviews on his book tour that he had personally authorized the use of waterboarding in the questioning of terrorism detainees.
As a result, international human rights groups, including Amnesty International, seized on the scheduled visit to petition the Swiss authorities to open an investigation of Mr. Bush while he was in the country. The groups argued that he had admitted to torture and thus could be prosecuted in Switzerland and other countries that have signed on to the international convention banning torture.
