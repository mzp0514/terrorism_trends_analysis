Thereâ*™s really no competition for the top issue in this election year, as 92 percent of all registered voters polled by Gallup say the economy ranks first. Unemployment comes in second with 82 percent ranking that either extremely or very important, and the federal budget deficit is third at 79 percent.
Republicans, Democrats and independents all list the economy as their top concern, but differences between the two parties soon begin to appear.
Eighty-five percent of Democrats consider unemployment very or extremely important, making it the second-most-important issue for them, with the gap between rich and poor third at 81 percent. Republicans rank the federal budget deficit second at 92 percent (only 66 percent of Democrats think thatâ*™s extremely or very important) and then unemployment third at 83 percent.
Independents rank the economy first at 89 percent, followed by the budget deficit at 80 percent and unemployment at 79 percent. Only 52 percent say the wealth gap is either extremely or very important.
When it comes to President Obamaâ*™s healthcare law, 78 percent of Republicans say itâ*™s either extremely or very important, while 76 percent of Democrats and 71 percent of independents agree.
But while 81 percent of Republicans list terrorism and national security as a leading concern, just 67 percent of Democrats and 69 percent of independents do.
Fifty-seven percent of Republicans and 51 percent of independents view immigration as very or extremely important, compared to just 41 percent of Democrats.
And even though the GOP primaries have become increasingly wrapped up in social issues, just 46 percent of Republicans list that as a major concern, with 36 percent of Democrats and 35 percent of independents doing likewise.
