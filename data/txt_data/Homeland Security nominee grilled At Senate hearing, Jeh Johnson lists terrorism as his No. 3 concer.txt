President Barack Obama's choice to run the Homeland Security Department placed the agency's core mission, counterterrorism, as his third priority during a confirmation hearing Wednesday and took some criticism for submitting written answers to Congress that cribbed responses from several other Obama administration nominees.
Most senators questioning Jeh Johnson suggested he was likely to win confirmation easily. but Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said he would place a hold on his nomination, joining another GOP senator who has made the same pledge.
In answers to a committee prehearing questionnaire, Johnson said his top three priorities were filling vacancies at the department, addressing low morale and terrorism.
Senators on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee did not raise any issue with Johnson's priority list.
Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn, however, the leading Republican on the committee, said he was concerned that Johnson's written answers to customary prehearing questions used the same language in 23 instances as several other Obama administration nominees.
McCain said he would block the nomination because Johnson refused to tell me that he would give me the information as to what is necessary to have 90 percent effective control of our border.
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has promised to block Johnson's nomination in an effort to compel the Obama administration to make the survivors of the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Libya available to speak with lawmakers.
