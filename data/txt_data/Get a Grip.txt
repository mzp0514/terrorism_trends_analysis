 Conservatives often complain that liberals refuse to confront the causes of terrorism. Rather than blame jihadists and radical Islam for terror attacks, the left prefers to talk about poverty, alienation, and so-called blowback - i.e., the process by which American policy inspires strikes against the United States.
 Britain recently had a narrow escape, as attacks in London and Glasgow failed. The alleged conspirators are not impoverished peasants and proles or even students at universities but medical doctors. Not only that, they apparently belonged to Britain's National Health Service.
 At least a few crackpots on the right have discussed a dark connection between socialized medicine and terrorism. Bureaucratic constraints apparently drive practitioners to the edge. The NHS is about 60 years old. Only a miracle can explain the absence of terrorist strikes by doctors, nurses, and orderlies during that span, or so we guess.
 This is of course bunk.
 The argument does not yet reflect mainstream opinion - which still recognizes that the root causes of terrorism lie in jihadist perversions of Islam - but such nonsense dismays veterans of a conservative movement that once upon a time considered itself as non-ideological.edit2 LOOKUP TERROR IN BRTAIN
