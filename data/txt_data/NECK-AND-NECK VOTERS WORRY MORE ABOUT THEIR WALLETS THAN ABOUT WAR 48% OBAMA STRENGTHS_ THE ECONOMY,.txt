When it comes to the nation's troubled economy, Missouri's likely voters put greater trust in Democrat Barack Obama than Republican John McCain.
That, in a nutshell, appears to be why Obama's standing in this battleground state has improved since last summer - and why, less than two weeks before the Nov. 4 election, Obama is locked in a too-close-to-call presidential contest with McCain, a new poll shows.
"The economy is driving the presidential race, no question about it,'' said Del Ali, head of Research 2000, which conducted the polls in Missouri and Illinois for the Post-Dispatch and KMOV-TV (Channel 4).
Among the 800 likely Missouri voters polled last week, 48 percent backed Obama, while 47 percent favored McCain. Three percent preferred one of three minor-party candidates, and 2 percent were undecided.
Although statistically insignificant, Obama's lead is his first in Missouri against McCain in any Research 2000 polls this year. The previous poll, in late September, showed McCain with a one-point edge.
In Illinois, Obama's home turf, it's a blowout. He holds a commanding 25-point lead over McCain.
In each state, the poll's margin of error is 3.5 percentage points for each number. In Missouri, that means either man could be ahead.
Missouri is among a handful of remaining toss-up states in the presidential contest. It's especially important for McCain.
"Obama doesn't need Missouri. McCain has to have it,'' Ali said. "There's no analysis that shows McCain can get to 270 (electoral votes) without Missouri."
Ali says Obama's strength with voters on economic issues is undoubtedly helping his cause. More than half of those polled in Missouri (52 percent) said they trusted his judgment more on the economy, compared with 43 percent for McCain.
Obama also got significantly higher marks on health care and the environment. He edged out McCain on gas prices, energy and taxes.
McCain was deemed far more trustworthy in tackling terrorism, international affairs, the war in Iraq and Supreme Court appointments.
McCain wasn't benefiting as much as expected on his foreign-policy strengths because domestic matters are at the top of many voters' minds, Ali said.
That's the case with poll participant Evelyn Tucker of Festus, a nurse primarily concerned with the economy and health care. She backs Obama. "I know he's inexperienced, but his heart is in the right place. He inspires my confidence,'' said Tucker, 51. "He's not going to be led around by the nose. That's my problem with Mr. McCain."
Joe Gabrick, a business owner in O'Fallon, Mo., supports McCain. "I like his conservative values and the direction he'll take the country,'' Gabrick, 47, said. "I like that he's strong on defense, and will continue our success in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.''
As for Obama: "I do not agree with the direction he wants to take the country."
Gabrick and Tucker exemplify the two candidates' gender appeal. A majority of women voters polled favored Obama, while a majority of the men preferred McCain.
Tucker and Gabrick also reflect opposing positions on the government's recent actions to spend up to $700 billion to aid financial institutions in trouble - a plan both presidential candidates voted for.
Gabrick was among the solid majority of those polled who oppose the aid. "I don't think it's wise to mortgage our children's future with the bailout,'' he said, adding that the nation's economy would improve "if the free market is allowed to perform as it has in the past.''
Tucker blamed lack of government oversight for some of the financial mess. She reluctantly supported the bailout, but added, "It's a shame that it came to that."
When asked specifically about the current financial mess, Missouri voters seemed to be wary of either presidential candidate's abilities. Only 33 percent said they had greater trust in Obama, compared with 22 percent for McCain. The biggest bloc - 45 percent - wasn't sure.
ILLINOIS VIEWS DIFFER
In Illinois, Obama outpolled McCain on every "trust" issue except fighting terrorism, where the Republican had a slight edge.
"I think (Obama) is a visionary who can move us forward,'' said poll respondent Mary Plocher, 55, a social worker from O'Fallon, Ill. "I'm a cancer survivor, and I think his health care plan will work better for me.''
Obama's popularity at home coincides with negative feelings in the state about the nation's current leadership - a typical response reflected in other polls around the country.
A whopping 84 percent of poll respondents said the nation was going in the "wrong direction,'' the highest level of dissatisfaction in Illinois in four years of polling. Likely Missouri voters polled weren't much more optimistic: 79 percent said the country was headed in the wrong direction.
Obama's favorite-son status in Illinois is the chief reason why neither candidate has been spending much on TV ads there. Over the past month in Illinois, McCain has spent no money in any of the state's major markets, according to TSNMI-Campaign Media Analysis Group, an ad-monitoring firm tracking campaign spending for the Post-Dispatch.
Obama has spent just under $1.2 million in TV ads aired on Illinois stations since mid-September, the firm says.
That's a far cry from the hefty spending in Missouri, which has fewer than half as many TV viewers.
Obama spent at least $1.1 million on TV ads just in the past week to reach Missouri voters, according to the ad-monitoring firm's latest report. That's more than twice as much as McCain, who reported spending $476,000 on Missouri TV stations.
Both candidates spent the bulk of their ad money in recent weeks in Kansas City and St. Louis. Although both cities are Democratic strongholds, their TV stations' viewers are primarily in the suburbs, which are swing territory or lean Republican.
RACE AN UNDERCURRENT
Looming behind the poll numbers in both polls is the issue of race. That was especially true in Missouri.
In both states, roughly a quarter of those polled - 24 percent in Illinois and 28 percent in Missouri - said they believed Obama's biracial background would be an "important'' or "very important'' factor.
At the same time, about three-quarters of those polled in Illinois said the nation was ready to elect an African-American as president.
In Missouri, only two-thirds of the respondents agreed.
Tim Jennings, a union carpenter from Cedar Hill who supports Obama, said he's heard the racial talk. "I know a couple of people who normally vote Democratic, who aren't going to vote Democratic for that reason,'' Jennings said.
Said Ali: "In a close contest, at the last minute, race could be enough to deny Obama a victory" in Missouri.
But Ali said other factors might play a role, including the rising unfavorable ratings of Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin.
Palin remains popular among the GOP base. She attracted about 20,000 for Friday's rally in Springfield, Mo.
Mary Schmidt, a McCain supporter from Affton, saw Palin at her Oct. 2 rally in St. Louis. "She was electrifying,'' Schmidt said, citing in particular Palin's opposition to abortion.
But Palin's unfavorable rating among those polled in Missouri has climbed to 47 percent, edging out her favorable rating of 44 percent. A month ago, her favorable rating was 50 percent.
