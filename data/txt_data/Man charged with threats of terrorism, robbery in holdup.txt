RIVERTON - A Lehi man was charged Thursday in connection with a bank robbery earlier this week that caused the evacuation of about a dozen businesses.
Douglas Kay McEwan, 60, is charged in 3rd District Court with aggravated robbery, a first-degree felony, and making a threat of terrorism, a second-degree felony, for allegedly presenting a device to Wells Fargo bank tellers Monday, claiming it was a bomb.
The bomb was a fake, consisting of computer pieces, wires and other materials, according to Unified police.
Police say McEwan entered the building at 1750 W. 12600 South around 9 a.m. and demanded $16,000 from a teller. When that teller "was taking too long to get the money, (McEwan) moved to another teller," charges state.
"He showed her the device in (a) bag and told her that, 'If you call the cops, I'll detonate it,' " according to the charges.
McEwan allegedly told the teller that an accomplice would detonate the bomb if the police were called. She gave McEwan the money, and he left the fake bomb inside before exiting the building, according to police.
McEwan was arrested outside the bank. Police say he had a handgun when he was arrested.
McEwan admitted to showing the second teller the fake bomb, court documents state. He told investigators "that he has been diagnosed with liver failure and would be dying soon," according to the charges.
McEwan has no significant criminal history in Utah, according to court records. He is being held in the Salt Lake County Jail.
No initial court date is currently set in his case.
