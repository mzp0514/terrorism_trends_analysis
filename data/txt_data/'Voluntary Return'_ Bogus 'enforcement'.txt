Through a program known as "Voluntary Return," U.S. immigration "enforcement" sends home nearly all apprehended illegal aliens with what's practically an invitation to again enter illegally. 
It's a glaring failing detailed in a new Center for Immigration Studies (cis.org) report on enforcement and deportation. Quick and economical, Voluntary Return boosts removal numbers and eases immigration judges' caseloads -- immigration officers can grant it in lieu of removal hearings -- but it's otherwise a good deal only for illegals. 
Illegals convicted of aggravated felonies or subject to national security or terrorism concerns aren't eligible. But those granted Voluntary Return can't be charged with a federal felony if caught returning illegally to the United States in the future -- and that undercuts deterrence. 
In fiscal year 2010, 92 percent of aliens apprehended for immigration violations were granted Voluntary Return. That's prima facie evidence of "overuse or misuse in recent years," as the report puts it. 
Illegals convicted of any crime should not be eligible for Voluntary Return. And deterrence must be restored by making greater use of more formal deportation proceedings that don't rule out felony consequences for returning illegally.
