The David Project never objected to  the construction of a mosque here in  Boston, but was concerned about the  connection some officials of the Islamic  Society of Boston have to supporters  of hatred and terrorism (Lawsuits  Dropped, But Battles Over Boston  Mosque Continue, June 29).
At the large community meeting  recently called to discuss the matter, we  heard from Sheikh Ahmed Monsour,  an Islamic scholar who fled his native  Egypt after being persecuted for leading  an Islamic reform movement. Monsour
used to attend the Islamic Society of
Boston mosque in Cambridge, and
he found there Saudi literature full of
hatred for Jews, Christians and the
United States.
When he complained to the press,  he was sued, along with the David  Project, by the Islamic Society of  Boston. Monsour told the large, mostly  Jewish crowd that though he has fatwas  against him and his family, he was  not afraid, and that they should stand  with the moderate American Muslims  against the extremists who are taking  over American mosques. He got a  standing ovation.
Those of us who were sued, 17 defendants  in all, garnered evidence through  depositions and subpoenaed records  that deepens our concern about the  radical ideology and connections to  supporters of terrorism of the Middle  Easterners, mostly Saudis, who own  and control the mosque. We also  uncovered evidence showing that the  charges against us were wholly unwarranted.  The Islamic Society of Boston  dropped the case, for no consideration,  when key officials were about to be  deposed under oath.
We all scream about wanting to see  moderate Muslims stand up. Here one  did, and we stood with him.
