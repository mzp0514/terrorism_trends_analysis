Michael De Luca is fighting the war on terrorism with the help of Mark Millar and Tony Harris.
The producer is bringing the comic-writing duo's latest, "War Heroes," to the big screen for Sony's Columbia Pictures.
The story centers on a U.S. military experimental program developed in light of dwindling enlistments and the expanding war on terrorism that gives ordinary soldiers superpowers. When a rogue group of the supersoldiers breaks off to form a criminal enterprise, one hero rises from their ranks to prevent catastrophic results.
No writer has been brought aboard. Millar and Harris are exec producing along with Zach Schiff-Abrams ("Domino"). Rachel O'Connor is overseeing for Columbia.
Outside of Marvel and DC titles, Millar's creator-owned comics have become one of the most sought-after materials for Hollywood. The Scot's first comic book series created with J.G. Jones and adapted for the big screen was "Wanted," which was released through Universal in June. That film has grossed $293 million worldwide.
Another superhero-themed comic by Millar and John Romita Jr., "Kick-Ass," is in production with Aaron Johnson, Nicolas Cage and Christopher Mintz-Plasse starring. Marv Films and Plan B. Entertainment are producing.
Another Harris' comic co-created with writer Brian K. Vaughan, "Ex Machina," is in development at New Line. 
De Luca recently wrapped "Brothers," starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Tobey Maguire and Natalie Portman. 
Millar is repped by CAA. Harris is repped by Illuminati Entertainment. Both are also repped by attorney Harris Miller. (partialdiff)
