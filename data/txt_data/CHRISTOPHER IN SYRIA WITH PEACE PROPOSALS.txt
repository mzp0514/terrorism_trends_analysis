By Barry Schweid DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Secretary of State
Warren Christopher arrived for talks with the Syrian government
Saturday carrying Israeli proposals to break a deadlock in peace
talks between the two nations.
Christopher delivered to Syrian President Hafez Assad a proposal
for Israel to withdraw in stages from the strategic Golan Heights and
security plans to ensure the area is not used for attacks on Israeli
villages.
Christopher also carried a list of complaints.  They included U
.S. allegations that Syria is looking the other way on drug
trafficking in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley and concern for increased
counterfeiting of $ 100 bills in Syria.  Also on Christopher's list of
issues were two perennial topics _ terrorism and human rights.
The Clinton administration, in a report to Congress, credits
Syria with an improved record on both counts.  Officials said Syria's
record continued to improve this year.  But the report, which covers
1993, keeps Syria on a list of seven countries promoting terrorism
Christopher also is seeking a detailed account from Assad and
Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa of a new arms deal concluded last week
with Russia.  Christopher wants to know if Syria will be getting
missiles from Moscow and if so, of what range.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets has said Russia
intends to continue to develop military, technology, energy and trade
ties forged in the past between Syria and the Soviet Union.
Syria, with Soviet help, became a potent military power in the
region, and also adopted a tough line toward Israel.  The Clinton
administration believes that stance is changing since the demise of
the Soviet empire.
