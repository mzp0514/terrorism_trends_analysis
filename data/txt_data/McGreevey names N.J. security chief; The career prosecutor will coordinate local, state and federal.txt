Gov. McGreevey yesterday named career prosecutor Kathryn Flicker to head the state's homeland-security effort.
With the appointment, McGreevey made good on a campaign promise to have a veteran law enforcement official coordinate local, state and federal efforts to end terrorism.
"I hope to fulfill the challenge of making New Jersey safe for my children and yours," Flicker said at a news conference with McGreevey.
She will head the state terrorism task force that was created after the Sept. 11 attacks and the anthrax assaults.
A key to her job will be collecting and analyzing information gathered by law enforcement agencies. She will have access to state police intelligence reports and will have daily contact with the federal Homeland Security Office.
Since 2000, Flicker has been the director of the Division of Criminal Justice in the Attorney General's Office. A prosecutor in Mercer County for 19 years, she won a conviction and death sentence against Jesse Timmendequas for the rape and murder of 7-year-old Megan Kanka.
"There is no real difference in gathering to assemble a case [and] assembling intelligence to understand the mind of terrorists," Flicker said. "Terrorists are criminals."
New Jersey authorities must cooperate with federal agencies to find and then read signs that point to threats, said Peter C. Harvey, the first assistant attorney general.
Attorney General David Samson will have 30 days to submit a plan for funding Flicker's new agency, McGreevey said.
