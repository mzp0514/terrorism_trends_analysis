A BRONX man yesterday became the first gang member convicted under the state terrorism law and now faces life in prison for the 2002 shooting death of a 10-year-old girl after a christening party.
Edgar Morales, 25, was tried in Bronx Supreme Court under the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001 after prosecutors argued that he and his gang, dubbed the St. James Boys, had acted like a fanatical terrorist group when they fought a gun battle that caught little Malenny Mendez in its crossfire.
The girl had been attending a christening party at St. Paul's Evangelical Lutheran Church in Parkchester.
"These were callous acts that resulted in the life of an innocent child being snuffed out," said Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson. "The jury's finding of terrorism is significant in determining an appropriate punishment."
Under the statute, Morales could get life without parole, compared with 25 years to life for murder without the terrorist accusation.
"As far as I'm concerned, he could rot in jail," said Antonia Mendez, Malenny's mom. "I was most interested in Morales getting convicted because I believe Morales was the shooter."
The jury bought into the terrorism theory after a month-long trial and five days of deliberations.
"The gang terrorized the community, and that night, they crashed the party and terrorized partygoers," said juror Linnea Daniels. "They fired shots into the crowd."
An earlier attempt to convict Morales had ended in a mistrial. Defense lawyer Dino Lombardi said he would appeal.
