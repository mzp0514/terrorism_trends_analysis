The Trump administration earlier slappedsanctions onHong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, the Asian financial hub's current and former police chiefs and other top officials in August for what it said was their role in curtailing freedoms in a crackdown on the territory's pro-democracy movement.
The eight, who include three former lawmakers, were detained for their role in a protest against the security law on July 1.
Hong Kong police said in a statement that eight men aged between 24 and 64 had been arrested for inciting, organizing and taking part in an unauthorized assembly.
Traditionally, a protest march is held every year on July 1 - the dayHong Kong was handed from British to Chinese control in 1997 - but this year's protest was banned with authorities citing the health risks from the pandemic.
However, reiterating China's stance, Zheng underlines thatHong Kong isChina'sHong Kong, andHong Kong affairs are purelyChina's internal affairs, in which the United States is not qualified at all to interfere. "One aspect of that assault has been the actions of the National People's Congress Standing Committee , which have effectively neutered the ability of the people ofHong Kong to choose their elected representatives in keeping with the Joint Declaration and Basic Law". At least 10 were arrested under the security law.
The law punishes what Beijing broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail.
Trudeau: Canada to get Pfizer vaccine by end of this year
Everything hinges on Health Canada approving the Pfizer vaccine, with a decision expected on that in the coming days. Bonnie Henry says vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna will be the first to be rolled out after approval by Health Canada.
The crackdown has led to accusations that Beijing is violating the autonomy it promisedHong Kong would have following the 1997 handover.
Thousands of people gathered on the streets to protest the national security law, which had taken effect inHong Kong the day before.
We can expect more measured and diplomatic language, to be sure, but pressure for Biden to continuesanctions onChina for its actions inHong Kong (and Xinjiang and Tibet, for that matter) far outstrips calls for a full "reset" in U.S.
The arrests came hours after the United Statessanctioned 14 top Chinese officials in retaliation for Beijing's disqualification of pro-democracy lawmakers fromHong Kong's legislature last month.
White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien said in November the expulsion showed the "One Country, Two Systems" formula, under whichHong Kong's autonomy was to be safeguarded after Britain handed the territory back toChina in 1997, was now "merely a fig leaf", and he promised further US action.
