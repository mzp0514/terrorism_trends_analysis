Former President George W. Bush writes in his memoir that his reply was "Damn right" when asked by the CIA to approve the use of waterboarding against 9/11 suspect Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. This cavalier attitude by the president, who authorized torture in violation of American and international law, not only damages our nation's credibility throughout the world but also discourages global cooperation to combat terrorism.
It was only last week that the United States was reminded that to protect our country from terrorists, and to collect vital information, we need the trust of individuals and governments worldwide. The bombs shipped on airplanes were stopped because of the cooperation of foreign intelligence services.
America stands the best chance of becoming the ally of more people around the world -- people who can join us in the fight against terrorism -- by rejecting torture. This effort is severely hampered when our leaders make such careless and rash remarks without realizing the harmful impact on America's security.
The Center for Victims of Torture renews its call for an independent, nonpartisan commission to examine and report publicly on torture and cruel treatment of prisoners since Sept. 11, 2001. Such a commission should be adequately funded and given subpoena power and a mandate to fully examine the facts and circumstances of such abuses and to recommend measures to prevent future abuses.
