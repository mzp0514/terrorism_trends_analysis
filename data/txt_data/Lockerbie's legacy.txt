A cancer expert whose terminal prognosis for the Lockerbie bomber helped secure his release from prison now says Libyan Abdel Baset al-Megrahi might live for another decade. 
Infamy never dies quickly. And the repugnant release of Mr. Megrahi, convicted of the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, is as infamous as any mindset that excuses terrorism. 
Megrahi was released on "compassionate grounds" last August after serving only eight years in a Scottish prison for the jetliner's bombing, which killed 270 people including four Western Pennsylvanians. Karol Sikora, who examined Megrahi for Libyan authorities, estimated his advanced prostate cancer gave him three months to live. Now Mr. Sikora, medical director of CancerPartners UK, tells the British press that Megrahi could live for years. It's "embarrassing," he says. 
No, it's an outrage that the only man convicted of one of the most deadly terrorist attacks in modern times was released at all -- and returned to Libya last year to a hero's welcome. This, amid accusations that Megrahi's release was premised on a quid pro quo with oil-rich Libya. 
So, what conclusion can families of the victims reach now except that Megrahi's release was rigged? 
The passing years, and payoffs, do not wipe away the incalculable injustice when presumably civilized nations turn a blind eye to terrorism.
