A man acquitted of terrorism conspiracy charges after a lengthy criminal trial has been accused of nearly identical offenses by federal immigration officials who want to deport him to Haiti.
  The charges were filed Tuesday against the man, Lyglenson Lemorin, 33, a member of the so-called Liberty City Seven group accused of plotting with a man they thought was from Al Qaeda to destroy the Sears Tower in Chicago and bomb Federal Bureau of Investigation offices in Miami and elsewhere.
  Mr. Lemorin was acquitted in December after a two-month trial, with jurors deadlocking on the remaining six defendants. Prosecutors are trying the six before a new jury, with testimony in its second day on Wednesday. Mr. Lemorin is expected to testify for the defense in this trial.
  Mr. Lemorin is a permanent legal resident with no criminal record, but a day after his acquittal he was taken to an immigration center and officials announced they would begin deportation proceedings.
  Immigration law provides for a much lower burden of proof than the ''beyond a reasonable doubt'' standard required for a verdict in a criminal case, making it easier for the government to deport someone using the same facts that led to an acquittal in a criminal trial.
  Mr. Lemorin's lawyer, Charles Kuck of Atlanta, said,  ''We are going to go ahead and contest the charges.''
