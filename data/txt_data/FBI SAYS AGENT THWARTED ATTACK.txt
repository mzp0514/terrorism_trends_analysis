The top FBI official in Detroit has insisted that his agents likely thwarted a terrorist attack by arresting four men in 2001, even though the Justice Department has withdrawn terrorism charges against them.
 "You should be proud of the excellent investigative work conducted by the JTTF [Joint Terrorism Task Force] in Detroit, and everyone should recognize that their efforts may have prevented another attack," Special Agent in Charge Daniel Roberts wrote last week in an e-mail to his entire office.
The e-mail was obtained by The Associated Press.
 Roberts sent his memo the same day the Justice Department asked a federal judge to dismiss convictions on terrorism counts against Karim Koubriti and other men accused of operating a terror cell in Detroit. The government sought a retrial on lesser fraud charges.
 The Justice Department said prosecutors withheld evidence from defense lawyers that might have resulted in a different verdict if the jury had seen it. The judge agreed to the department's request, unraveling the Bush administration's lone major terror prosecution since Sept. 11.
 Justice's court filing questioned the accuracy of trial testimony by FBI agents. Roberts, on the other hand, said the agents "acted aggressively and worked very hard on this case in an effort to prevent a terrorist attack."
 FBI officials said Roberts was referring to evidence from Turkish authorities that Osama bin Laden called off an attack on a Turkish air base used by U.S. forces because security was heightened.
