A Utah woman was arrested Thursday after she allegedly threatened to “kill everybody” at a dentist’s office when she was late for her children’s appointments and had to reschedule.
The 43-year-old Saratoga Springs woman was booked into the Utah County jail for investigation of making a threat of terrorism, a second-degree felony.
According to a probable cause statement, the incident began about 3 p.m. Thursday when the suspect — who was, at that point, an hour late to appointments for her two teenage children — called the office and became “very angry” when she was told she would have to reschedule.
In a recorded conversation with the dentist’s receptionist, the woman said that sometimes in these situations “gun people come in and they shoot everyone." According to police, she went on to say, “I’ll be there next Tuesday at 2 o’clock, and if we are five minutes late and you guys make us reschedule, then I will come in and KILL EVERYBODY, that’s what I’ll do.” And, she added, “Well, I might this afternoon because I’m super angry, so watch out."
When police arrived at the building that houses the dentist’s office and several other medical suites, it was “on lockdown” and “many employees feared for their lives.” Police walked a number of employees to their cars so they could leave the area.
According to Saratoga Springs police, when the suspect was questioned, she said, “I would never really do that,” and she “downplayed the phone call and would not admit to the death threats.” She was advised that the call had been recorded.
