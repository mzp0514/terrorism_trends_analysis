It's official "” Hillary Clinton has broken with the Obama administration. In the presumptive Democrat nominee's speech on terrorism last week, the former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of State said we must "go after the key enablers of terrorism" to prevail. 
Can we safely assume that Mrs. Clinton is recommending President Obama be indicted for prosecuting the war on terror with dismissiveness, followed by apologies, then followed with a medium-sized wet noodle? ... Of course, Mr. Obama burnished his credentials as a resolute leader last week by doing the wave at a baseball game with Cuban dictator Raul Castro; by appearing in a comedy skit with a Cuban actor; by doing the tango with a sultry dancer in Argentina; and by yet again claiming that ISIS "” you know, the "JV team" "” does not represent an "existential threat" to America's national security. ... In short order after the terrorist attack in Brussels, many in the media began showing the standard tributes to the fallen. Flowers, candles, Teddy bears, balloons, wreaths and so on. These displays show "solidarity," we are told. What really should be shown "” and what really would honor those killed and those maimed "” would be the dissemination of their  gruesome photos wide and far and without relent. To understand such horror, one must see such horror. It's long past time for everyone to stop playing pat-a-cake.
