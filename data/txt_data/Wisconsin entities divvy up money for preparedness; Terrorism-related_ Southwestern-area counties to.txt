Wisconsin counties will split $$ @2.6 million in federal aid to buy terrorism-preparedness equipment. 
Grant County is receiving $$ @22,000, Crawford County $$ @21,000, Iowa County $$ @20,000, and Lafayette $$ @18,400. 
The eligible equipment includes personal protective gear, such as hazardous-materials suits, respiratory protection, decontamination equipment and communications gear.
"This grant gives us an excellent opportunity to better prepare our local emergency responders for all types of emergencies," said Grant County Emergency Management Services Director Steve Braun in a news release.
The equipment, he adds, is not just "terrorism-specific." It increases the county's readiness to handle a variety of threats and situations, including hazardous-materials spills.
Braun said the federal money will supplement a countywide initiative to increase local capability to handle hazardous situations. In recent months, the county emergency-management office has sponsored several hazardous-materials and decontamination courses for fire departments throughout the county. Using state training funds, a number of additional hazardous-materials and domestic-preparedness classes are scheduled for firefighters, police and emergency medical responders beginning in March.
According to Braun, efforts are also under way to improve decontamination capabilities in Boscobel and Platteville. Last year Grant Regional Health Center in Lancaster installed a new decontamination facility to handle patients who are contaminated with dangerous substances.
