The National Basketball Association announced yesterday that it had canceled an Oct. 8 exhibition game in Russia featuring the Utah Jazz against the Moscow club CSKA because the recent terrorist attacks in the country presented a security threat to the game.
 ''We've got a wonderful security staff with the N.B.A., and if they tell us not to go, there must be a good reason,'' said Kevin O'Connor, the general manager of the Utah Jazz. 
The Jazz's marquee player, Andrei Kirilenko, who is from Russia, played for CSKA and was the primary reason to the two teams were to have met in Moscow.
  David Stern, the commissioner of the N.B.A., said in a statement yesterday that the league would work with CSKA to reschedule a game and regretted that the ''unstable situation in Russia'' was threatening security. 
 ''We are saddened that it will not be possible for the Jazz to play CSKA Moscow next month,'' Mr. Stern said in the statement, adding that he was confident that the game ''would have been a great success.'' 
 The president of CSKA, Aleksandr Gomelsky, told Reuters that the club had given the N.B.A. security assurances and was disappointed that the game had been canceled. 
 The Atlanta Hawks were the last N.B.A. team to play in Russia, in 1988 against the Soviet national team. 
 The N.B.A. is still sending two teams overseas for exhibition games, with the Houston Rockets and Sacramento Kings playing Oct. 14 and 17 in Shanghai and Beijing.
