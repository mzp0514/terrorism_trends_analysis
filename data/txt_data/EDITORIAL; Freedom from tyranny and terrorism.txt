Independence Day celebrates the United States' rejection of the tyranny of a British king. It celebrates freedom, democracy and the American way of life.
Terrorism and tyranny have much in common.
 Cruelty and injustice are trademarks of tyranny, as violence and intimidation are trademarks of terrorism. The difference means little -- to the victim. They are about control and power.
 Terrorism is much on America's mind this Fourth of July. The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept. 11 left vivid images in our private and public consciousness. They have driven the federal government to reach for and to consolidate more power over individual citizens in the name of security. They have made the public willing to give up some small amount of privacy. They have made us accept a little inconvenience at airports, entryways to public buildings and at our borders.
 Terrorism has eroded, at least in principle, some of the very freedoms and rights that were earned by American patriots in the Revolutionary War -- freedoms and rights liberated from King George III of England.
 Americans should be more cautious in giving in to federal measures in the name of the war on terrorism. To give up personal freedom for security against terrorism is to accept the yoke of a different kind of tyranny. As the Stars and Stripes wave today, we should give thought to those hard-fought freedoms and to the new security measures.
 The United States should reject terrorism right along with tyranny.
