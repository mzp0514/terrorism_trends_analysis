Pledging to "combat the merchants of hatred with every means at our command, " President Clinton was leaving for the multi-nation summit in Egypt today to search for ways to restore a bomb-shattered peace in Israel.
"We must not let the terrorists in the Middle East have the victory they seek: The death of the very hope for peace," he told an Irish-American audience in New York on Monday.
"I ask for your prayers."
He spoke about the Mideast summit even as he was being honored as the " Irish American of the Year" for his peacemaking efforts in Northern Ireland - a peace that also was shaken by recent bombings in London.
"The solidarity of peacemakers in this world today must be stronger than bullets or bombs," said Clinton, his voice scratchy from a cold. "The will of the people for peace is more powerful than the impulse for division."
Meanwhile, diplomatic sources said Monday the president's trip to the Middle East is the first step toward a strategic anti-terrorism and intelligence agreement between the United States and Israel.
The agreement would be announced in April during a visit to Washington by Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
Clinton goes to Israel after participating Wednesday in the "Summit of the Peacemakers" at Sharm el-Sheik, the Israeli-built resort on Egypt's Red Sea coast.
Clinton spent a long day Monday, first in New Jersey to promote his environmental goals - and to lambast the Republicans for trying to cut them back - and in New York where he accepted the award and attended an event that raised $1.5 million for Democratic congressional campaigns.
