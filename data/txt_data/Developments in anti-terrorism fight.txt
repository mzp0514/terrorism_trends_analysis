What happened Sunday in the war against terrorism:
 * U.S. jets pounded Kabul, and strong explosions could be heard in the direction of the main road from the Afghan capital to the opposition-controlled Bagram air base. American bombs also reportedly pounded targets in the northern city of Mazar-e Sharif, the Taliban stronghold of Kandahar in the south, Herat in the west and Jalalabad in the east.
 * Two C-17 transport planes dropped 34,000 more rations in northern Afghanistan. That brings the food-aid effort to 925,200 packages of rations dropped over the country during the 3 weeks of combat, according to the Pentagon.
 * The commander of the 3rd U.S. Army said his forces are ready to join a wider war against terrorism. In an interview Sunday in Egypt, where he was wrapping up joint military exercises, Lt. Gen. Paul Mikolashek described his forces as "agile, flexible and determined."
The forces' area of responsibility stretches from Central Asia to the Horn of Africa, including Afghanistan. The 3rd U.S. Army, based in Fort McPherson, Ga., maintains forces and equipment in Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
"What is key is that the enemy is not Afghanistan," Mikolashek said. "It is not, certainly, the Afghan people, but it is terrorism, and places in which terrorists find safe havens."
 * A pro-Taliban group of armed Pakistani tribesmen has taken over an isolated military airstrip in northwestern Pakistan near the Afghan border, witnesses and aviation officials said.
