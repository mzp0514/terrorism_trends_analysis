Sep. 19--Yemen is a long way from Aiken County, but the attack on the U.S. embassy there shows that America and American interests abroad are not safe from attacks by terrorists.
Although the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, are seven years in the past, the United States remains in the cross-hairs of terrorists who want to see our way of life come to a crashing end.
No Americans were killed in the attack by a suicide car bomber as well as other assailants armed with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons. In all, however, 16 people perished, including six of the attackers.
While not as alarming as the attacks of seven years ago, this assault on the embassy should let all Americans know that there are those who are still intent on attacking anything of importance to the United States. Since embassies are seen as part of a nation's soil in a foreign country, this was a direct attack on America.
The war on terror is very real. Those who think that the lack of a repeat of Sept. 11 within our borders is evidence that the war has been won are misled. While we are safer today than we were seven years ago, there is still danger for this country from agents of violence. We must keep up our guard and seek out terrorists wherever they are.
