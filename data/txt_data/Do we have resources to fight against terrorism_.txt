Editor, New Era:
In order for the United States to be safe again we will have to both stamp out the terrorists as well as take control, for the short term, every country that supports terrorism until we can reprogram them.
However we no longer have the resources to fight another Desert Storm, let alone take control of all those terrorist-supporting countries.

Now we will immediately go on a rampage and strike back for a short while, but when we encounter resistance there will be political division and our Congress will be arguing over whether to spend our money on military and security or on new social programs; our resolve to stop terrorism will be lost.
I agree with R. Limbaugh's opinion that we'll begin the reverting back to politics as usual by the end of September.
In the meantime, while we are still emotionally charged, let us ask ourselves one important question. Since it is the federal government's main job to provide for the defense of our country, doesn't Bill Clinton deserve the same punishment, for cutting our military and rejecting improved airport security recommended to him and thereby inviting attack, as we have in store for Osama bin Laden?
