It is high time defense spending is brought under control. Since neither party has the  courage to tackle the defense industry, sequestration may be a blessing in disguise ("Pentagon fears drastic cuts with lack of spending bill," News, Friday).
One advantage of maintaining a smaller military force is that it will be less tempting to use it in situations that don't warrant it.
We  need to rethink the war on terrorism. Sept. 11  wasn't made possible because we weren't spending enough on defense.  The Sept. 11 attack should have taught us that fighting terrorism requires a different set of tools.
In addition, we need to encourage our allies to take on more of the costs of their own defense. We have  hundreds  of military  facilities overseas.  There simply is no justification for this. In fact, our presence can be  a destabilizing influence, sowing the seeds of discord for future generations of Americans to inherit.
Scaring people into defense spending is easy. Bringing some sanity to the defense equation will be much harder. But it is critical to the long-term viability of this nation that we do so, even if it means going over the fiscal cliff.

There is only one group of people that cannot possibly be fired or laid off, take a reduction in pay or lose any benefits if the sequester goes through. Those will be the lawmakers who will decide to let it happen.
One can only hope that on the way to every airport, they hit every pothole in the road and every flight they  take is delayed by at least four hours.
This "it's no skin off my back" way of legislating is obscene unless you have no concern about anything but yourselves.
