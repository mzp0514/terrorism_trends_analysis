Now is a time for mourning as our nation recovers from a great tragedy. And, we must reflect on why this occurred before unleashing the dogs of war.
Terrorism is all around us. From the Unabomber's war on computer technology to Christian extremists' attacks on abortion clinics to Middle East Muslims attacking the great Satan - the United States.
The TV mini-series "Masada" gave us a 2,000-year-old story about a band of Hebrew terrorists fighting their great Satan, the Roman Empire.
It was hard not to cheer for these people as they fought vainly to free their country from exploitation by the heavy-handed Romans. The entire band eventually committed suicide rather than submit to Roman domination.
Leaf through the pages of history and note the succession of empires that forcefully engulfed smaller nations, taking mineral wealth; placing humans into bondage - slavery; establishing repressive, puppet governments;, erecting military fortifications;, etc. Then we may begin to understand why the seeds of hatred grow.
Waging a war on terrorism will not heal the underlying cause that energizes oppressed people to hopelessly hurl themselves at our machines of war and symbols of government.
Perhaps we should take a lesson from Jesus' Sermon on the Mount. "Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God."
The current resident of the White House has squandered the opportunity to lead Israel and the Palestinians toward peace. It is past time to get seriously engaged in securing peace in that region.
And, while we're at it, we should divorce ourselves from dependence on Middle East oil by developing alternate energy sources within our own great country.
