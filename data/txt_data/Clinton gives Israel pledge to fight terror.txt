JERUSALEM - President Clinton pledged $ 100 million in
anti-terrorism aid to Israel as he wrapped up a Mideast peace trip
quickly scheduled in the wake of recent bombings.
Clinton offered $ 100 million over two years - $ 50 million now and
$ 50 million he will request from Congress - to help Israel buy
equipment to detect and handle bombs.
But he warned that while terrorism is a problem for the Mideast
now, "It will be the (world's) principal security problem of the
future and . . . we had better get after it."
In Washington, however, the House passed 229-191 a watered-down
bill to combat crime and terrorism.
Conservatives of both parties, pressured by the National Rifle
Association and other groups, were able to strip some provisions
they said gave the government too much power.
Among them: one to keep agents of groups such as Hamas,
responsible for the Israeli bombs, from coming to the United States
for fund-raising.
Clinton, who sought the bill after the Oklahoma City federal
building bombing, said he hoped for stronger measures.
It "needs to . . . help us combat terrorism at home and abroad,"
Clinton said.
In the Mideast, Israeli officials suggested the U.S. aid be used
to establish a separation zone with the West Bank to try to prevent
terrorist infiltration.
But State Department officials frowned on that plan, already
denounced by Palestinian leaders.
U.S. officials said the aid is intended for sensing systems and
robots to handle packages.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and CIA Director John
Deutch stayed in Israel for talks on a pact to increase cooperation
on terrorism.
U.S. officials hope to finish the accord before Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres visits Washington on April 19.
