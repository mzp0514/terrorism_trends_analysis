Twenty-three volunteers serving Eden Fire Company recently completed an eight-hour training program on terrorism.
The program, "Emergency Response to Terrorism: A First Responders Perspective," was developed and sponsored by the Lancaster County Emergency Management Agency.
#EDENFC.F1320#
The program discussed the motivation of terrorist groups and reviewed tactical operations and considerations at ground zero. It also outlined mass decontamination procedures and crime scene and evidence preservation practices.
The events of Sept. 11 and the subsequent anthrax and suspicious package incidents identified a need for emergency services to improve preparedness and training. Eden responded to several suspicious package and white powder incidents in 2001. All were false.
The company is planning to host additional programs including personal protection, patient care and incident command and control.
Members completing the initial program were Eric G. Bachman, Bret Mitchell, Joseph Banzhof, Sam Farmer, Joe Farmer, Dennis Pavlic, Ian Solodky, Josh Zulick, Clifford Nolt, Kelly Ruth, Jen Ressler, Rick Kane, David J. Howey Jr., Joshua Eisenhower, Tim Seely, Mike Roten, Chris Slaymaker, W. Geoffrey Miller, Michael Minnier, Thomas Ziegler, Betty Bringman, Terrie Minnier and Susan Osborne.
