WE GOT LUCKY when a would-be terrorist's attempt to turn an SUV into an incendiary device in New York's Time Square failed.
And we got lucky that the alleged perpetrator was quickly apprehended. But as we report on page 3, there's no guarantee that we'll be anywhere near as lucky the next time, and there is sure to be a next time.
Fortunately, security professionals say some relatively simple steps can help diminish the likelihood that a terrorist car bomb or other device will result in destruction of property or loss of life.
Securing perimeters is crucial to minimizing this risk. Actions such as restricting the access of unknown panel trucks to facilities and training personnel to be on the lookout for such things as cars riding low on their springs can enhance security. When possible, building resistance into new buildings-such as using shatterproof glass where appropriate-also can bolster the lines of defense.
No security system is foolproof, but taking reasonable precautions cannot help but mitigate the effects of a small-scale terrorist attack under many circumstances.
Luck alone, welcome as it was in the Times Square case, won't suffice by itself. Only preparedness can respond effectively the next time, and that next time may happen sooner than anyone would like to think.
