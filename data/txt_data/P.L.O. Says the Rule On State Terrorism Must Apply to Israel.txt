Yasir Arafat and other Palestine Liberation Organization leaders accused Israel today of engaging in state terrorism and urged the United States to hold Israel to the same standards as it does the P.L.O.
Mr. Arafat, who returned to Tunis today from Geneva, charged at a news conference that the killing of four Palestinians by the Israelis on Friday was proof of state terrorism.
At another session with journalists here today, Yasir Abed Rabbo, head of the P.L.O. delegation that held the first round of talks with American officials Friday, said he warned the Americans that Israeli intelligence was planning acts of provocation that would appear to have been sponsored by the P.L.O.
American and P.L.O. officials held their first meeting Friday after Washington decided that the organization had met all American conditions for contacts.
No more sessions are scheduled. One official said both sides had to analyze the opening round first.
Mr. Abed said Mr. Arafat is ''a real target of assassination.'' Security around the chairman appears to have been increased. At his news conference, he carried both his usual sidearm and an Italian submachine gun.
''What happened yesterday is proof that Israeli policy is now state terrorism,'' Mr. Arafat said of the deaths in clashes in the occupied West Bank.
