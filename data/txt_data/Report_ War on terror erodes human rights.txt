LONDON (AP) - In its fight against terrorism, the United States has eroded rights worldwide, Amnesty International said Wednesday. 
In its annual report, the London-based rights group said politicians around the world - from Australia to Sudan - were taking advantage of "shortsighted" U.S. leadership in a fight against  terrorism that sacrifices individual liberties. 
"One of the biggest blows to human rights has been the attempt of Western democratic states to roll back some fundamental principles of human rights - like the prohibition of torture," Amnesty's Secretary-General Irene Khan said before the report's launch. She also criticized the U.S. policy of extraordinary rendition. 
While Amnesty International has highlighted rights issues that have erupted since the Sept. 11 terror attacks in the United States, little of the 337-page report dealt with the terrorist threat itself or attacks linked to the al-Qaida terror network. 
European countries were accused of failing to challenge the U.S. military putting terror suspects on secret flights to third countries for interrogations. Britain, Australia and Japan were singled out for passing harsh new anti-terror laws. 
Khan also noted the deteriorating human rights situation in Zimbabwe and Darfur, which she called "a bleeding wound on world conscience." 
Amnesty also criticized Israel, saying its army killed more than 650 Palestinians last year - half of them unarmed civilians, including some 120 children - a threefold increase from 2005.
