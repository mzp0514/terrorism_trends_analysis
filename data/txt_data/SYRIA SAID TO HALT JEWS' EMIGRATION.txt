Syria has refused for eight weeks to issue exit permits to Jews wishing to leave, United States officials said today.
Under strong pressure from Washington, Syria started granting exit visas to Jews last April. About 2,600 were given visas, The Washington Jewish Week reported.
The weekly, which first reported the halt in exit permits last Friday, said 1,400 Jews remain in Syria. State Department officials say about 400 want to stay.
The United States Ambassador, Christopher W. S. Ross, has asked Syrian officials several times to explain the halt, one United States official said.  The Syrians insist they have not changed their policy.
Another official said President Hafez al-Assad of Syria appeared to be holding back the visas so he would have a card to play when the administration of President-elect Bill Clinton takes over. Several times during the election campaign, Mr. Clinton said the Syrian leader had supported terrorism.
Syria wants to be removed from a State Department list of countries supporting terrorism, which would open the way for trade and other financial benefits. Its decision to join peace talks with Israel was viewed in part as a desire to win favor with Washington.

Syria Reports Talks Deadlocked
 DAMASCUS, Syria, Dec. 14 (Reuters) -- President Assad said today that Arab-Israeli peace talks were deadlocked and that Israel had offered nothing new. In a speech to labor unions, he said that Syria would continue to attend the negotiations but that there was a limit to its patience. He urged Israel to announce its readiness to withdraw fully from all Arab lands.
