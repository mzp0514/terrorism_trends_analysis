DAVOS, Switzerland -- The United States faced more criticism at the World Economic Forum on Friday, this time for conducting a war on terrorism that opponents claim targets Muslims and violates human rights.
After weathering complaints about their stance on Iraq, American officials were told they are guilty of racial profiling and should try harder to discover the roots of terrorism.
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said focusing on prevention of terrorism without addressing the causes was wrong.
Those responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks "were incensed over something" and the world should try to understand what motivated them, Mahathir said.
U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft Ashcroft retorted that the Sept. 11 attackers engaged in "hostage-taking to kill innocent civilians," adding that "the targets of terrorism are values and the rule of law."
Kumi Naidoo, secretary-general of the South Africa-based Civicus-World Alliance for Citizen Participation, criticized "the severe curtailment of civil liberties" in democratic countries, including the United States.
He cited the "invasion of privacy rights," bans on meetings by certain groups, and travel restrictions for Arabs and others.
Ashcroft disputed the contention that freedom is being sacrificed for security, saying only individuals who violated the law have been detained and all have access to lawyers.
