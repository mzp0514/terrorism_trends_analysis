For a film dealing with terrorism and packed with suspense "Arlington Road" has relatively little action. Director Mark Pellington, best known for making Pearl Jam's "Jeremy" video, instead pays tribute to the old fashioned mystery-thrillers of the Hitchcock era.

Jeff Bridges, in a much more mature role after "The Big Lebowski," plays widowed father Michael Faraday. No, not the famous physicist, but a highly emotional professor who lectures on terrorism. Tim Robbins, in a deeply layered performance, plays the ideal neighbor Oliver Lang, whose family lives across the street. Joan Cusack portrays Lang's all-too-perfect wife. Faraday meets Lang when he rescues Lang's son from a firecracker accident. As the Faradays quickly befriend the Langs, Faraday watc hes his son fall under Lang's questionably benevolent influence. He begins to have suspicions about Lang's shady background, which escalate into a paranoia that drives him to the edge.
Both Bridges and Robbins give strong performances, and their exchange of words alone builds tension and excitement. The film has nothing new to say about paranoia, but its commentary on terrorism and disguised references to the Oklahoma City bombing make it relevant, albeit somewhat fanciful.
While no masterpiece, "Arlington Road" is a well constructed suspense film of the sort not seen too often in this day and age. It proves that a movie need not have a big budget to be amply entertaining.
