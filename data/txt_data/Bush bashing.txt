Hardly a day goes by that the word "terrorist" is not echoed in the media. The White House blames other countries for spreading terrorism. Conversely, much of the world, including most of our former allies, refers to the U.S. as the terrorist.
Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, and the deaths of thousands of innocent Iraqis, support this point of view. Iraqis say there were no insurgents in their country until after the United States invaded.
Four years later, 2 million Iraqis have fled the country and 4 million are without homes.
The fact is, Iraq never presented a terrorist threat, but the administration's unprovoked invasion has fueled the spread of global terrorism. The latest available Department of State analysis, "Patterns of Global Terrorism" (2003), indicated the highest terror activity in the report's 19-year history.
In 2004, after the administration challenged its methodology, the report was no longer made available to the public.
The situation has become a full civil war with the U.S. in the middle. We can begin to rectify this debacle by continued vigilant congressional oversight of the Bush administration and by setting a withdrawal date from Iraq. The Iraqis want justice, not democracy.
