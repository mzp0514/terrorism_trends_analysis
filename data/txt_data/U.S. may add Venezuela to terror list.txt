The Trump administration is preparing to add Venezuela to the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism in what would be a dramatic escalation against the socialist government of Nicolás Maduro, according to U.S. officials and internal government emails. The list is reserved for governments accused of repeatedly providing "support for acts of international terrorism" and includes only Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria. Republican lawmakers led by Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida have pushed for the designation, citing Venezuela's alleged ties to groups such as Lebanese Hezbollah and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. Experts have played down the threat and strength of the country's connections to terror groups. They warn that a designation that does not offer concrete evidence could weaken the legitimacy of the U.S. list, which critics say already is applied inconsistently. U.S. officials declined to say whether a final decision had been made about the designation, but in recent days the State Department has asked for feedback on the proposed move from various agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is part of HHS; and the U.S. Agency for International Development. A State Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the pending decision.
