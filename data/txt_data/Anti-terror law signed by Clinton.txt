President Clinton, raising the stakes in the fight against terrorism,
signed a bill Monday that punishes foreign firms that invest in
Iran and Libya.
Clinton called the nations "two of the most dangerous supporters
of terrorism" and predicted that the USA's European allies, which
have protested the law, will support it.
"Every advanced country is going to have to make up its mind
whether it can do business with people by day who turn around
and fuel attacks on their innocent civilians by night," Clinton
said.
Clinton cited the recent bombing of U.S. barracks in Saudi Arabia
and the crash of TWA Flight 800, whose cause is yet to be determined,
as part of a frightening future.
"Terrorism is the enemy of our generation, and we must prevail,"
Clinton said.
Targeting Libya reflects frustration over its refusal to extradite
two men accused in the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.
And Defense Secretary William Perry last week suggested that Iran
may be linked to the Saudi bombing that killed 19.
The sanctions, which include denying Export-Import Bank loans,
would apply to foreign firms that make new investments of more
than $ 40 million annually in the energy sectors of Iran or Libya.
The law would not affect existing contracts.
France, Germany and Britain, as well as the European Union, are
among those who have threatened retaliation.
But the hope in Europe is that "after the elections, this law
will be shelved or watered down," says Steven Englender, economist
with the Paris office of Smith Barney brokerage.
Total SA, a French company, has stakes in Libyan oil fields and
has signed a $ 600 million deal to develop offshore oilfields for
Iran.
