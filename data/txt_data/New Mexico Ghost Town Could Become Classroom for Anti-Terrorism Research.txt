If two New Mexico universities get their way, they soon could be the proud owners of a ghost town.
The New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology and the New Mexico State University system hope to turn the 64-acre town of Playas into a real-world classroom for anti-terrorism research and training.
About 20 miles from the Mexican border, Playas was once the company town for a copper-smelting operation owned by Phelps Dodge Corporation, which put the town up for sale for $3.2-million after the mining company cut costs in 1999.
New Mexico Tech hopes to use part of a Congressional earmark it received last year to purchase and operate Playas, says Van D. Romero, the university's vice president for research. The earmark was for the training of emergency personnel who are often the first to arrive at the scene of a disaster or terrorist attack. The college would use the town, which boasts 259 houses, a post office, and a bowling alley, to provide the so-called first responders with an environment in which to conduct their exercises. New Mexico State hopes to use the surrounding 1,200 acres, which come with the town, for agro-terrorism research.
There's just one catch: The earmark doesn't allow New Mexico Tech to purchase the town outright. The federal government would need to buy it and then allow the institutions to operate it.
To help broker the deal, Sen. Pete V. Domenici, a New Mexico Republican, wrote a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge, urging him to approve the sale. "I am sure this could be a great asset for the new department," he wrote. The department has yet to decide on the purchase.
