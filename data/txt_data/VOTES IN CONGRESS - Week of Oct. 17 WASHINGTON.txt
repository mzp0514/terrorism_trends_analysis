(House not in session)
KEY VOTES IN SENATE
Obama jobs plans - Senators failed, 50-50, to reach 60 votes for advancing a bill by President Barack Obama to provide $35 billion to avert state and local layoffs of teachers, police and firefighters. A yes vote backed a bill (S1723) paid for by a .05 percent surtax on incomes over $1 million.
Yes - McCaskill (D-Mo.), Durbin (D-Ill.)
No - Blunt (R-Mo.), Kirk (R-Ill.)
GOP repeal bid - Senators failed, 57-43, to reach 60 votes for advancing GOP-backed repeal of a law on government contractors. Aimed at tax cheats, the law requires 3 percent of contract sums withheld as a credit against federal taxes. A yes vote was to end a law seen as a jobs-killer. (S1726)
Yes - Blunt (R-Mo.), McCaskill (D-Mo.), Kirk (R-Ill.)
No - Durbin (D-Ill.)
Millionaires' farm payments - Senators voted, 84-15, to reduce to $1 million from $2.5 million the income limit above which active and casual farmers are ineligible for crop subsidies, cash payments, loans and other farm payments. A yes vote was to reduce the limit as part of HR2112.
Yes - McCaskill (D-Mo.), Durbin (D-Ill.), Kirk (R-Ill.)
No - Blunt (R-Mo.)
Terrorism trials - Voting 47-52, senators refused to require terrorism suspects linked to al-Qaida to be tried in U.S. military tribunals rather than in federal courts. A yes vote backed the amendment to HR2112 over arguments that federal courts have a long record of successful terrorism prosecutions.
Yes - Blunt (R-Mo.)
No - McCaskill (D-Mo.), Durbin (D-Ill.), Kirk (R-Ill.)
Commission on prisons - Senators failed, 57-43, to reach 60 votes for advancing a proposed national commission to review the U.S. prison system, which now holds 2.3 million inmates. A yes vote backed the measure over arguments that it is a federal overreach into state and local affairs. (HR2112)
Yes - McCaskill (D-Mo.), Durbin (D-Ill.)
No - Blunt (R-Mo.), Kirk (R-Ill.)
Drugs from Canada - Senators refused, 45-55, to make it legal for Americans to import federally approved, U.S.-made pharmaceuticals from Canada for their own use. A yes vote backed an amendment to allow such imports by mail order, online purchases or in person. (HR2112)
Yes - McCaskill (D-Mo.)
No - Blunt (R-Mo.), Durbin (D-Ill.), Kirk (R-Ill.)
Commerce Secretary Bryson - Senators confirmed, 74-26, John Bryson as secretary of commerce. Bryson, 69, has headed the energy firm Edison International and was a founder of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental organization. A yes vote backed Bryson to replace Gary Locke, who became U.S. ambassador to China in July.
