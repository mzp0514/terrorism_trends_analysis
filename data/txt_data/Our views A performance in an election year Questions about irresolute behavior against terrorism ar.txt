CHRIS Wallace of Fox News asked former President Bill Clinton: "Did you do enough to connect the dots and go after al Qaida?" It was a fair question, which came with an acknowledgement that "hindsight is 20/20."
Clinton huffed and puffed, pointed his finger, and tried to spin this softball question about the long line of attacks leading up to 9/11 into evidence of Hillary's complaint about a "vast right-wing conspiracy."
Clinton accused Wallace of having "a little smirk" on his face and just kept going. "You did Fox's bidding on this show. You did your nice little conservative hit job on me," he told an astonished Wallace.
"ABC just had a right-wing conservative run in their little 'Pathway to 9/11,' " Clinton also complained.
He also cited the book by his former counterterrorism chief, Richard Clarke, in defense of his administration. But National Review's Byron York sees in Clarke's book, which shifts the blame for inaction to the CIA and the FBI, evidence of an irresolute president who did not take decisive action.
Clinton's spokesman followed up his performance by saying: "We're fully aware of Fox News' and Chris Wallace's agenda, and President Clinton came in prepared to respond to any attack on his record. When Wallace questioned his record on terrorism, he responded forcefully, as any Democrat would or should."
Oh, an election-year performance.
