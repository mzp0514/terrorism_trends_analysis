WASHINGTON - With tensions and anti-U.S. sentiments running high in the
Middle East, the State Department says Americans abroad should be on
guard for their safety.
"In the immediate future, U.S. citizens traveling or residing abroad may
wish to exercise greater-than-usual caution in light of the recent
events in the Middle East and threats made to American interests from
Hezbollah and other extremist groups," the department said in a
statement Friday night.
Artillery exchanges between Israel and radical Islamic Hezbollah
guerrillas in Lebanon has accounted for heavy civilian casualties and
renewed tensions between Arabs and Israelis in the region. While there
have been public denunciations of the U.S. government's close ties to
Israel, the State Department said was no indication of imminent attacks
on Americans.
"Although the Department of State has no specific information regarding
threats to U.S. citizens, we cannot discount the possibility of random
acts of anti-American violence," it said. "U.S. diplomatic posts are
taking appropriate security precautions."
The department routinely issues travel warnings and advisories for
specific countries or regions to warn tourists of health risks or
threats of political or criminal violence.
