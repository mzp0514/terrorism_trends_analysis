NEW YORK'S new top
G-man is a woman.
Janice Fedarcyk is the first female FBI agent to hold the high-profile post and she's an expert on the biggest threat the city faces - terrorism.
Fedarcyk, who has been with the FBI for nearly 23 years, is more than qualified for the job, said FBI Director Robert Mueller.
Fedarcyk "managed terrorist financing investigations" and served at the National Counterterrorism Center, Mueller said.
The announcement was made Thursday.
As head of the FBI office in Philadelphia, Fedarcyk oversaw the bust of Colleen LaRose, aka "Jihad Jane," a Pennsylvania woman who was arrested for trying to recruit Islamic terrorists online.
Fedarcyk, 52, has also won praise for her work in tracking down perverts who use the Internet for child pornography.
A former cop in Reno, Nev., Fedarcyk joined the FBI in 1987 and specialized in counterterrorism and emergency response.
Her FBI bio states Fedarcyk "was instrumental in leading the development of a classified national strategic operational plan in the war on terrorism."
For Fedarcyk, counter-terrorism could be pillow talk. She is married to retired FBI agent Mike Fedarcyk, who had a hand in virtually every terrorism investigation before and after 9/11.
