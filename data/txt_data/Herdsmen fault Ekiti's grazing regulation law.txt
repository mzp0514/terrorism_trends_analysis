Lagos, Sept. 1 -- Cattle rearers in Ekiti State said Wednesday that the state government could not charge erring members of the association with terrorism for carrying light weapons.
The herdsmen, under the aegis of Ekiti State chapter of the Jamu Nate Fulbe Association of Nigeria, an umbrella body for cattle rearers from Ilorin, Kwara State, said such would be in contravention of the Anti-Terrorism Law as contained in the 1999 constitution.
Legal Adviser to the association, Mr. Umar Imam, said the Anti-Terrorism Law of the Federation stated clearly what constituted an infringement of the law and that carrying of lesser arms does not constitute offence under the provision.
He said: "The law of the federation on terrorism is very clear and no one can be charged for terrorism for carrying lesser arms like cutlasses, catapults and knives during the grazing period as contained in Ekiti new law."
This was as the Seriki of the association in Ekiti, Alhaji Ahmadu Mahmoud, appealed to the governor to amend the new law, so that his members can be allowed to carry lesser arms to ward off attacks from robbers.
Mahmoud added that outright banning of night movement would make their jobs difficult and create more confusion than expected.
"We agree with the governor on the grazing period of between 7am and 6pm, but we should be allowed to carry lesser arms and relocate at night.
