PORTO ALEGRE, BRAZIL The world's biggest group of Christian churches criticized the use of military forces to fight terrorism Thursday and denounced both the cartoons of the prophet Muhammad and the Muslim rage they unleashed.
Wrapping up a wide-ranging conference, the statements underscored how the World Council of Churches increasingly wants to exert its influence into areas separate from its basic mission -- seeking greater unity among Christians.
But the 10-day meeting -- the largest gathering of Christian denominations in nearly a decade -- also showed the limits of the WCC, which has no real lobbying power and can only urge its nearly 350 member churches to support public policies on topics as diverse as relations with Muslims, nuclear arms and efforts to battle AIDS.
"We are trying to play the role that's expected of us," said the Rev. Samuel Kobia, general secretary of the WCC, which includes mainline Protestants, Anglicans and Orthodox churches representing more than 500 million followers. The Roman Catholic Church is not a member, but it cooperates closely.
The conference delegates urged the WCC to "claim a clearer and stronger public profile." The statements appeared to move the Geneva-based group in that direction -- and at times into clear disagreement with U.S. policies.
The group urged its member churches to oppose the use of military forces to fight terrorism and complained that U.S.-led anti-terrorism efforts threaten to undermine international law and human rights. It also called for more projects with Muslim leaders to serve as "an early warning system" against religious radicalism, saying terrorism "can never be justified legally, theologically or ethically."
