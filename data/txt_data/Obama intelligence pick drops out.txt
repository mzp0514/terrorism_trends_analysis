 WASHINGTON ? President Barack Obama's pick to be the intelligence chief at the Department of Homeland Security withdrew from consideration Friday amid signs that he could face congressional opposition over his role in the CIA's interrogation of terrorism suspects. 
Philip Mudd, who has held a series of senior positions at the CIA and FBI, said in a statement released by the White House that he had decided to step aside out of concern that his nomination would "become a distraction" to the administration. Mudd became the latest candidate for a high-level intelligence position to be forced to withdraw after being tied to the CIA's use of severe methods to interrogate terrorism suspects. From 2002 to 2005, Mudd served as deputy director of the CIA's counterterrorism center, a unit that swelled in size in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, and was responsible for running the agency's secret overseas prisons. Since 2005, Mudd has served as an assistant director of the FBI's national security branch and has been credited with helping the bureau shift emphasis from catching criminals to gathering intelligence and preventing terrorist attacks. The FBI and CIA faced severe criticism for their failures leading up to the Sept. 11 attacks. Mudd's arrival at the bureau came amid a major shakeup in U.S. intelligence gathering and was seen as an effort to bolster ties between the FBI and CIA. An FBI spokesman said that Mudd was expected to remain in his job at the bureau. White House spokesman Nick Shapiro said that Obama believed Mudd "would have been an excellent undersecretary for intelligence and analysis but understands his personal decision."
