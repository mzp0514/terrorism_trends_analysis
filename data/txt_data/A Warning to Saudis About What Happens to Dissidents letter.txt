To the Editor:
In your excellent Oct. 19 editorial “Mr. Trump, Don’t Back Down Now,” you write that “contrary to Mr. Trump’s suggestions, this was a crime against America.” That is certainly the case, but the killing of Jamal Khashoggi was even more so a crime against the people of Saudi Arabia. 
It was in its effect and probably in its intent an act of state terrorism that sent the following message to the kingdom’s already intimidated people: We have just murdered a well-connected, powerful, prominent individual who dared to criticize us. It would be even easier for us to murder any one of you who may be foolish enough to voice criticism of our policies.
It is the same message previous tyrants have sent. Mussolini sent it when Fascists assassinated the opposition leader Giacomo Matteotti. Stalin sent it when he included prominent leaders of the Communist Party such as Nikolai Bukharin and Leon Trotsky in his purges. Hitler sent it when he had former Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher murdered. Mao Zedong sent it when people previously prominent in the Chinese Communist Party were sent to their deaths. 
In each of these cases, and so many others, the tyrants knew that murders of the previously powerful sent a well-justified chill down the spines of millions.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman appears to be following this barbaric policy of previous dictators.
