RSEC:             It was his first day on the job as Minnesota's new U.S. attorney, and already Tom Heffelfinger was talking terrorism.
     Heffelfinger, who returned Monday to the job that he held for about 1 1/2 years in the early 1990s, said he attended meetings about terrorism on his first day and has more scheduled this week.
   Part of his job, he said, will be to coordinate the exchange of information among federal, state and local authorities.
     "The challenge of the job is going to be to do all the usual Department of Justice priorities . . . in addition to playing an important role in response to September 11," Heffelfinger said.
     The FBI already leads a terrorism task force in Minnesota, and Heffelfinger said his office historicallykg has helped authorities share information "safely and effectively."
     The 53-year-old Republican was U.S. attorney from late 1991 to 1993 after being nominated by President George Bush. His name was submitted for consideration this spring by U.S. Rep. Jim Ramstad, Minnesota's senior Republican congressman.
     Heffelfinger has said he intends to continue forging better relationships between the U.S. attorney's office and community leaders, particularly leaders of minority groups. He practiced general litigation and American Indian law at a private firm in Minneapolis before his appointment.
