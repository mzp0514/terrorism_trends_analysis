IN A HISTORIC verdict, a Brooklyn civil jury Monday found Arab Bank liable for 24 terrorist attacks that killed or wounded nearly 300 U.S. citizens in Israel.
"This is an enormous milestone," said the plaintiffs' lawyer, Gary Osen. "This is the first financial institution held liable for knowingly supporting terrorism."
After a five-week trial in Brooklyn Federal Court, the plaintiffs proved that Arab Bank either knowingly, or with willful blindness, transferred millions of dollars to charities controlled by the Hamas terror group and to families of suicide bombers between 2001 and 2004.
Arab Bank argued that its hands were clean of blood because the charities were humanitarian groups that were not designated as terrorist organizations by the United States or any other government.
The case marked the first time a bank has faced a trial under the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001, which allows victims of U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations to seek compensation.
The lawyer for the Jordan-based bank, Shand Stephens, said they'd appeal.
A new jury will decide monetary damages at a later date.
Meanwhile, a new group is planning on using a similar tactic against brutal Islamic State fanatics.
The Counter Extremism Project aims to cut the flow of money to the militants by unmasking companies and private donors that have been funding them or selling oil from parts of Iraq and Syria they now control.
"This is a problem that can't be attacked by government alone," Fran Townsend, the group's president and a former homeland security adviser under President George W. Bush, said Monday.
