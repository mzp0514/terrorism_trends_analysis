The Federal Bureau of Investigation prevented 23 planned terrorist acts in this country last year and took ''a number of terrorists out of circulation,'' William H. Webster, Director of the bureau, said today.
Mr. Webster said in testimony before a House subcommittee that the bureau had thwarted planned assassinations of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India, of Libyan dissidents and of witnesses cooperating against a right-wing terrorist organization.
He said at least 14 planned bombings in the Washington area and the Northeast had been prevented by arrests and seizures of explosive materials.
Mr. Webster gave the breakdown in a report on terrorism to the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the House Judiciary Committee. #7 Terrorist Incidents in '85 There were seven terrorist incidents in the country in 1985, Mr. Webster said. Bureau figures show there were 13 such incidents in 1984, 31 in 1983, 51 in 1982, 42 in 1981 and 29 in 1980.
Two people were killed in the 1985 incidents, none in the 1984 incidents, six in 1983, seven in 1982, one in 1981 and one in 1980, according to the bureau.
Robert B. Oakley, the State Department's Acting Ambassador at Large for counterterrorism, gave the subcommittee a different picture of terrorism around the world.
He said that there were 800 incidents in 1985 and that the victims included 23 Americans killed and 139 injured.
Mr. Oakley said the United States had''decided upon a still more vigorous campaign of counterterrorism and will not be deterred by the risk of retaliation in this country.''
He said the United States had managed to ''awaken'' other governments to the need for antiterrorism measures but added that it often took attacks at airports and other locations to convince them.
Mr. Webster said, ''We think that recent accomplishments have not only taken a number of terrorists out of circulation but have helped create a perception that conditions in the United States are decidedly inhospitable for others of like mind and purpose.''
He said the bureau obtained arrests or convictions in cases involving the United Freedom Front, the Armed Resistance Unit, the Red Guerrilla Resistance, the Revolutionary Fighting Group, the Aryan Nations and its affiliate group the Order, and a Puerto Rican group, E.P.B. Macheteros.
