More than ever we need to show an uncompromising respect for all human life. The horrible terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, D.C., totally ignored the humanity of innocent people who felt safe and secure.
Their lives were violently and abruptly taken.
The terrorists do not have the "right to choose" to end innocent lives.
We must honor the sanctity of all human life and we must fight against the culture of death wherever we find it. We have to stand up against abortion, euthanasia and other crimes against humanity that just as certainly attack innocent human life and just as certainly leave no survivors.
With the attacks, the unthinkable became headline news. But with abortion, the unthinkable is now commonplace and accepted.
The victims of the World Trade Center collapse were crushed. Their bodies were broken apart. The sight was enough to sicken even veteran rescue and emergency medical personnel.
Yet that's exactly what happens in many abortions. The babies are crushed and dismembered. Why do we feel so repulsed by terrorism horror but accept the same results with abortion? Shouldn't we be horrified by both?
How can we mourn for the innocent in one case, but completely ignore their humanity in another?
Please pray for all the innocent victims and for those who do not see that civilization cannot survive any form of violence that preys on the most vulnerable among us.
