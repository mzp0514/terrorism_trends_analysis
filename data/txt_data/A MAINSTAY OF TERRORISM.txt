Federal officials say most Americans are not even aware of some of the most serious ramifications of drug abuse.

''It's with drugs,'' he added. ''This is a very critical part of the drug problem.''
In Burma, Communist insurgents control the northern part of the country, and the Government has been unable to rout them, largely because they bring in millions of dollars by growing opium poppies.
And in Peru, the Shining Path Marxist guerrillas have been randomly murdering dozens of people with weapons and explosives they buy with money collected from Peruvian coca dealers.
Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. said: ''People come to me and say the big issue is terrorism now. Well, that's true. But where are the terrorists getting their money? They're getting it from drugs. If you want to fight terrorism, you've got to fight drugs.''
Gary D. Liming, a deputy assistant administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, said, ''If you reduce drugs, it is going to have a broad, far-reaching impact on areas you haven't even thought of before.''
