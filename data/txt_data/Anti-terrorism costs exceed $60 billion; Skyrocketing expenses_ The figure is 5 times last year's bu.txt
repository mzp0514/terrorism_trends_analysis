Congress has provided more than $$ @60 billion since September to combat terrorism at home and abroad and to rebuild from the attacks on New York and Washington. That's roughly five times what the nation spent to fight terrorism in the previous year. 
Some costs are one-time expenses or will diminish in coming years - like helping communities recover from the Sept. 11 devastation, but other anti-terrorism programs are sure to grow.
When he sends Congress his $$ @2 trillion budget for fiscal 2003 next month, President Bush is expected to propose billions more for the military's $$ @345 billion wartime budget for the rest of this year, plus a hefty increase for next year for government-wide anti-terrorism efforts. Fiscal 2003 begins Oct. 1. 
Republican aides on the House Budget Committee estimate that so-called homeland-security programs alone - such as hiring FBI agents - will grow by $$ @150 billion over the next decade. 
Bush's budget is expected to propose a $$ @15 billion increase for domestic-security programs, everything from protecting nuclear power plants to building up federal vaccine stockpiles. The White House says $$ @34 billion was enacted for such programs for fiscal 2002. 
"The president has made this a priority," said White House budget office spokeswoman Amy Call. "We'll fund it at a level that reflects that priority."
The Defense Department says that from Sept. 11 through Dec. 10, the most recent date available, it spent nearly $$ @2.9 billion for operations in Afghanistan, plus $$ @1.8 billion domestically for combat air patrols over some U.S. cities and to call up National Guard and Reserve troops. That averages more than $$ @1.5 billion per month.
