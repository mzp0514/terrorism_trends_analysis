The State Department said today that it was looking into participation by American companies in a water project in Libya, but it said there was no indication so far that any law had been broken.
John Hughes, spokesman for the department, confirmed that the Government had approved exports of some American equipment for the multibillion-dollar project, in which at least two American companies are extensively involved.

The Reagan Administration has charged that Libya is involved in international terrorism, and it has actively discouraged Americans from going to or staying in Libya.
The water project, inaugurated Tuesday by the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, will transport water hundreds of miles from aquifers beneath Libya's desert interior to the Mediterranean coast. The cost of the first phase is projected at $3.5 billion.
The British office of Brown & Root Inc. of Houston is handling project management and preliminary engineering, and the Price Brothers Company of Dayton, Ohio, is a technical consultant.
