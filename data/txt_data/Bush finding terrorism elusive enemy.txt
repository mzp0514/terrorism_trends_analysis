I was just 11 years old 61 years ago when the radio brought us the news of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. We experienced much of the same emotions after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack.
It was determined that the al-Qaida and their leader, Osama bin Laden, were responsible and were sheltered in Afghanistan. We responded by bombing Afghanistan, and thousands of Afghan men, women and children were killed. There have been many causalities since, but none of them bin Laden.
In his "Axis of Evil" speech, Bush drew a parallel to the Axis Powers of World War II. But that comparison falls flat. With the Axis Powers, we knew who the enemies were and where to find them. Not so with terrorists. Terrorism is not a country, but a method used by those who perceive (rightly or not) a wrong that needs to be avenged.
By some mysterious metamorphosis, Osama bin Laden is now Saddam Hussein and the al-Qaida is now Iraq. How strange when 15 of the 19 Sept. 11 terrorists were citizens of Saudi Arabia.
It appears that Bush's apparent vendetta to finish his father's war will happen no matter what the weapons-inspection Team discovers.
Among the most precious of our freedoms is the freedom of speech. Yet Bush says if you disagree with him, you are being unpatriotic. Where are the so-called great constitutional defenders when it comes to this issue or to the freedoms that have been compromised with the creation of the Homeland Security Department?
Those responsible for the Sept. 11 attack should be held responsible. But if we believe waging war on Iraq will accomplish that or end terrorism, we will be in for a rude awakening.
