The 2014 Winter Olympic Games have reopened the biennial angst about the Olympic movement. While much of the criticism of Russia's president and Sochi's lack of preparation for terrorism and tourists is justified, the Olympic ideal and athletic excellence are reasons enough to welcome the Games.
Security concerns have been growing along with the region's Islamic insurgency. Russia apparently agrees. The Iron Curtain may have fallen with the breakup of the Soviet Union, but Russia has erected a "ring of steel" around Sochi, with nearly 50,000 security forces dispatched to guard the Games. It's a shame that the specter of terrorism overshadows an event meant to inspire peace, but Russia is not alone in facing extremists. Last Sunday's Super Bowl required extraordinary security measures, too.
Olympic Village preparation is more in Sochi's control, and it is disappointing that despite a reported record investment of nearly $51 billion, workers are scrambling to complete the job.
Putin's increasingly repressive regime is another source of concern. He may embrace the Olympic spotlight, but not the values the flame represents.
Of course, it's not the first time that the Olympics have been held in a compromised country.
And it's not fair to associate the athletes with the regressive atmosphere in Russia.
Indeed, the Sochi Games are a celebration of winter itself - and an event that should warm even the most frigid of Minnesota winters with pride. At least for a fortnight, it's time to marvel at the competition, cheer for the 27 athletes with ties to this state and hope for a future in Russia that better represents Olympic ideals.
