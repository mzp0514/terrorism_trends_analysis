WASHINGTON (AP) - Specially trained National Guard units would help local and state officials respond to potential terrorist attacks from chemical, biological or even nuclear weapons, Defense Secretary William Cohen announced on Tuesday.
''These teams will arrive quickly, assess the scene and help ensure these affected areas get the federal assistance'' they need, Cohen told the National Press Club.
Over the coming year, the Guard will set up 10 units, each composed of 22 full-time members and 22 reserve members. Cohen has asked Congress for $ 49.2 million in next year's budget for training and equipment.
Noting the threat posed by incidents such as the sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway or the terrorist bombing of the World Trade Center in New York, Cohen said the nation must be better prepared against potential chemical, biological or even nuclear catastrophe.
The new units will be given additional training and equipment, and National Guard and reserve forces could be deployed to handle reconnaissance and decontamination missions. A new office will oversee coordination of the units with existing ones, said officials at a Pentagon briefing.
The exact locations of the first 10 units will be chosen by May.
