Diplomat Daniel Kurtzer is quoted in a  July 6 article as saying of Tony Blair, It  is hard to see how he will succeed as  Middle East envoy unless  and this  is the key  Washington ratchets up its  own diplomacy and pursues a parallel  track of serious diplomacy (Europe  Turns Toward Mideast With High-Level  Appointments). But this misconstrues  the Middle East situation.
The absence of Israeli-Palestinian  peace is due not to an absence of  American diplomatic effort, but to the  absence of a Palestinian willingness to  accept Israel's existence as a Jewish  state.
President Bush's October 2001 declaration  of support for a future Palestinian  state  something that President  Clinton never publicly offered  not  only persuaded the Palestinians and others  that the United States was weak and  concessionary, but also rewarded Yasser  Arafat for resorting to terrorism.
This was one of a number of  Americans missteps that has helped  ensure that Palestinians do not fulfill  their signed commitments under the  Oslo agreements to jail and disarm terrorists  and end the incitement to hatred  and murder in the Palestinian Authoritycontrolled  media, mosques, schools and  youth camps.
The Bush administration has not  shown indifference toward the non-existent  peace process. To the contrary, it  has pursued fruitless cease-fires, schedules  and plans that ignore the continuation  of Palestinian terrorism. Blair's  future efforts to move ahead as though  these facts didn't exist are doomed to  failure for similar reasons.
