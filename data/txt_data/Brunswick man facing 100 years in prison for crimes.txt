Oct. 27--Brunswick man facing 100 years in prison for crimes
A Brunswick street gangster could receive close to 100 years in prison Tuesday when he is sentenced for a slew of crime, stemming from a 2017 incident in which he kidnapped a woman at gunpoint in Wayne County, according to the Brunswick Judicial Circuit's District Attorney.
Carey West will be sentenced in Wayne County Superior Court, facing a possible prison sentence of 95 years on charges ranging from kidnapping to aggravated assault, DA Jackie Johnson said. The member of Glynn County's faction of the Gangster Disciples street gang was convicted this week of those charges as well as false imprisonment, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, false imprisonment and violation of Georgia's Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act, Johnson said.
In June of 2017, West and several associates gathered at a motel in Wayne County, where he met the victim, according to the DA. West placed a gun to the Wayne County woman's head and forced her to return with him to Glynn County. Later, West brought the woman back to Wayne County, releasing her.
Assistant District Attorneys John B. Johnson III and Chad Highsmith prosecuted the case against West in Wayne County Superior Court. The case against West was bolstered significantly by the work of Wayne County Sheriff's Office investigator Brandon Rozier, Johnson said.
