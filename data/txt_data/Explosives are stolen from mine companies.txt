Dozens of bags of explosives have been stolen from mining companies in Arizona since last October, and federal authorities think the thieves may be from St. George. A pound of ammonium nitrate could obliterate a car, according to Craig Harding, a public information officer with the St. George Police Department. The bags that were stolen from mining companies, south and east of the Black Rock area, range from 20 pounds to 50 pounds each, he said. Nothing else was taken during the October theft and another one last month, Harding said. Ammonium nitrate is the same compound used in the 1995 attack on the federal building in Oklahoma City. Could the recent thefts be related to terrorism? "We don't know the motive," Harding said. "I guess it could be [terrorism]. It could also be kids making pipe bombs. We're not ruling anything out. We're not going to focus on terrorists and skip over the kids making pipe bombs." The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms asked for help from the St. George Police Department after the most recent theft, when investigators uncovered evidence that points to suspects from Washington County. Anyone with information about the thefts is asked to call the department at 435-634-5001. - Patrick DeLany
