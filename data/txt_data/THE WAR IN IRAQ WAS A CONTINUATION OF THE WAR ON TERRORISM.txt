I hear lots of bellyaching about U.S. forces being unable to find any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Some say, "There, you see? It's a scam.
Bush was just going in to cover for his old man!" Such posterior reasoning can usually be ignored, but sometimes the record needs to be set straight!
 The Iraq war was a continuation of the war on terrorism, a war that President Bush said from the beginning was going to take a while, possibly beyond his administration. The terrorists do need to get funding somewhere, and Iraq was one of the sources.
 It was proved that Saddam Hussein's regime financially supported families of Palestinian homicide bombers, encouraging them to breed more homicide bombers. As far as the WMDs, it was proved that Iraq gassed many Kurds in the north. Gas is a WMD so for Iraq to use it, it had to have it.
 Once Iraq was kicked over, lots of things scurried out. France had under-the-table deals with Iraq. The United Nations' oil-for-food program was a racket, lining the pockets of U.N. diplomats. Also, a murderous tyrant is now out of the picture and a people now have the opportunity to live in a country instead of a prison.
 The bottom line is that there are people out there who, no matter what, will not be swayed to support the president. A certain nationally syndicated radio talk show host said if Bush were a con man, we would have found WMDs in Iraq because the military would have planted them there.
