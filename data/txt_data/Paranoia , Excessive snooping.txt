DEFINITELY, federal anti-terrorism agents should identify and track known extremists - mostly young, male, fanatical Muslims - who enter America. That group caused 9/ 11 and other horrors around the world.
But the current administration has gone overboard with excessive surveillance of ordinary Americans in the name of combating terror. The Los Angeles Times-Washington Post News Service reports:
"The U.S. government is collecting electronic records on the travel habits of millions of Americans who fly, drive or take cruises abroad, retaining data on the persons with whom they travel or plan to stay, the personal items they carry during their journeys, and even the books that travelers have carried."
This Big Brother snooping is done by the Department of Homeland Security's Automated Targeting System. Highly personal data on everyone - even harmless old ladies on cruises - is stored for up to 15 years, to be scanned for hints of terrorism.
"The federal government is trying to build a surveillance society," civil liberties activist John Gilmore protested.
That's an ugly image of America. Surely, it's possible for counterterrorism experts to monitor known zealots without spying on millions of innocent, ordinary travelers.
