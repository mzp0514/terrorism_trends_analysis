Aug. 27--Depot milestones noted with 'commanders' tree'
TOBYHANNA -- In a prelude to its 100th anniversary next year, the Tobyhanna Army Depot on Friday honored eight former commanders who steered the sprawling base into the military's premier spot for repairs on sophisticated electronic equipment from around the world and created Northeast Pennsylvania's largest employer in the process.
The ceremonies, marked by bright blue skies and a sea of patriotism, included the official planting of the "commanders' tree" and the unveiling of a plaque near a Vietnam-era helicopter gunship in the center of the 1,296-acre facility that was originally used as an artillery training camp.
Highlights of the former commanders' accomplishments were announced by Frank Zardecki, deputy depot commander, as he called each to the stage, one by one.
Retired Col. Carl Little, the 16th commander who was in charge 1980-1982, was cited for his efforts to modernize the depot and make it the "center of technical excellence."
During the tenure of retired Maj. Gen. Thomas L. Prather Jr., 1985-1987, the depot saw the arrival of robotic systems that spray-painted shelters. Mr. Zardecki said they are "now gone."
Retired Col. Rex M. Isley's, 1989-1991, stint at the depot saw the preparation for "Operation Just Cause" in Panama.
Retired Col. Thomas F. Springer, 1991-1993, the 21st commander at the depot, oversaw the overhaul of a satellite terminal.
Retired Col. Michael A. Lindquist, 1993-1995, the 22nd commander at the depot, was involved in the stepped up support for the United Nations mission in Somalia by delivering radio sets. His leadership was instrumental in achieving in-house training in "Total Army Quality," Mr. Zardecki said.
Retired Col. Kurt Weidenthal II, 1999-2001, the 25th depot commander, oversaw the dispatch of the first team to Kosovo to support NATO operations by setting up a computer repair shop for automated data processing equipment, as well as the new night vision/electro optics division at the depot, Mr. Zardecki said.
Col. Tracy L. Ellis, 2001-2003, saw the ramp-up in work and personnel in response to the war on terrorism. The Navy granted indefinite certification for the depot to repair and test Sidewinder missile guidance and control systems, a significant milestone for Tobyhanna, Mr. Zardecki said.
Col. Ron P. Alberto, 2006-2009, also saw the workload grow in response to terrorism, he said.
