WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Terrorists armed with weapons of mass destruction pose a "genuine threat" to U.S. security, the Washington Post reported Thursday, citing a report by a panel assessing the nation's vulnerability.
The 18-member commission, chaired by Virginia Gov. James S. Gilmore, a Virginia Republican, said terrorists armed with ever-changing technology could strike virtually at will against federal, state and local governments that in too many cases fail to communicate with each other.
Panel members concluded there was "too much ambiguity" about who would be in charge if an attack took place, according to the Post, which said it obtained a copy of the report.
The country's lack of a "clear, comprehensive and truly integrated national preparedness strategy means that we may still remain fundamentally incapable of responding effectively to a serious terrorist attack," the commission concluded.
"A major cultural change is needed in government that will allow the exchange of critical information between . . . authorities about actual and potential threats," it said.
The panel, formed to advise Congress and the administration, is made up of retired senior military officers, medical officials, emergency planners and intelligence experts. The group put the finishing touches on its 67-page report earlier this week and delivered it on Wednesday to Capitol Hill and the White House.
Citing the 1995 Tokyo nerve gas attack, as well as the deadly bombings in Oklahoma City and at the World Trade Center in New York, the report said terrorists now have weapons ideally suited to killing small or large numbers of people and instilling fear and panic in thousands more.
