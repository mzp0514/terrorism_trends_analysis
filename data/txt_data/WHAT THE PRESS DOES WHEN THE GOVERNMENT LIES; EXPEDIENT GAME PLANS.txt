To the Editor:
The resignation of Bernard Kalb as State Department spokesman to protest what he called the Administration's ''reported disinformation program'' (front page, Oct. 9) is noteworthy in that both Mr. Kalb's ability and professional journalistic integrity are unquestioned.
These reported allegations, at least to date, seem to be just that and not fixed policy, only strategy suggested by the national security adviser.
Every administration has game plans for emergencies, most never used.
Yet one wonders whether in rare instances some deception might be justified for the common world interest. If we regard terrorism as despicable and something to be crushed, certainly every ploy and stratagem to use against it should be examined for practicality rather than whether it conforms to normal diplomatic mores.
We and our allies frequently used deception in World Wars I and II with no hesitation. The ultimate goal of victory was overriding. To have thought otherwise would have been naive and defeating. And the horror of terrorism, whether induced by a Libya or Syria or whoever, must be attacked with the use of any wartime expedient.
This is not to suggest any criticism of Bernard Kalb's action, which, in view of his background and devotion to truth, is to be applauded. He will be missed.JACK GROSS Hershey, Pa., Oct. 9, 1986
