WASHINGTON (AP) - The House must end "secret, backroom negotiations"
and pass President Clinton's anti-terrorism bill, stalled since June, to
help prevent future tragedies such as the Oklahoma City bombing, a
Democratic lawmaker said Thursday.
"It is time for every member who opposes the terrorism bill to stand up
in the light of day on the House floor and explain to the American
people why he or she opposes it," Rep. Charles Schumer of New York,
senior Democrat of the House Judiciary subcommittee on crime, said at
the panel's hearing on armed, private militias.
"It is time to stop the secret, backroom negotiations that are going on
regarding this bill," said Schumer. He filed a petition Thursday to
bring the bill to the floor within a week or so. The petition requires
218 signatures to take effect.
Fellow panel member Bob Barr, R-Ga., a leading opponent of the measure,
rejected Schumer's assertions.
"There's no backroom dealing," Barr said. Instead, he said, lawmakers
concerned about a possible erosion of civil liberties are engaged in a
"very careful, deliberative effort" to revise it.
Crime subcommittee Chairman Bill McCollum, R-Fla., said the House
Republican leadership had assured him there would be a vote before
Congress adjourns for the year.
Schumer said he was convinced the anti-terrorism bill would help prevent
future tragedies such as the Oklahoma City and World Trade Center
bombings.
The April 19 explosion in Oklahoma killed 169 people and injured 500.
The trade center explosion in February 1993 killed six and injured more
than 1,000.
