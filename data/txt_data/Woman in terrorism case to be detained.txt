In a hushed voice and chained at the ankles, a Henrico County woman accused of lying about her alleged involvement with a terrorist organization waived her rights to a detention hearing Wednesday and was ordered held pending trial.
Heather Elizabeth Coffman, 29, surrounded by her defense team and several federal agents, barely spoke during a 10-minute hearing before a federal magistrate that revealed no new details of her case and no prospective date for trial.
 Coffman, who resided in the 4300 block of Penick Road a few miles from the Henrico Government Center before her arrest six days ago, is facing up to eight years in prison, a $250,000 fine and three years of probation if convicted of a federal complaint that she lied to federal agents about her involvement with and knowledge of activities linked to the Islamic State.
 But the federal complaint alleges she spent months coordinating the transfer of a man into Islamic State hands and developed contacts with the group's agents before federal agents caught on to her, apparently by monitoring her Internet postings and Facebook pages.
 When asked about elements of her past that the agents became aware of and about contacts with the Islamic State, she denied them - creating the basis for the federal charge that she lied to federal agents.
 A woman at Coffman's home declined to comment. A ragged American flag is posted outside her front door along with a no trespassing sign.
