(RTTNews) - Prosecutors in a Pakistani court on Tuesday laid out terror charges against five American nationals arrested on suspicion of conspiring to carry out terrorist attacks.
Reports quoting prosecution lawyer Nadeem Akram said the charges presented to the court in Sargodha included waging war against Pakistan and planning to carry out terrorist attacks in the South Asian country.
The next hearing of the case has been posted to March 10. The accused could get life imprisonment if found guilty.
The young students were arrested in December at a house in the eastern city of Sargodha, home to one of Pakistan&apos;s biggest air bases, days after their families reported them missing in the US state of Virginia.
Pakistani Police said emails showed the five men were plotting terrorist attacks in the country with the help of Islamist extremist groups.
The suspects claim innocence, saying they had wanted only to provide fellow Muslims with medical and financial support, while defense lawyers said the five men were en route to Afghanistan when they were arrested.
Two of the suspects are of Pakistani origin and the three others of Egyptian, Yemeni and Eritrean descent.
They accused the US and Pakistani authorities of torturing and threatening them with death while in custody.
