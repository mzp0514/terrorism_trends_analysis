To the Editor:
In "After the Empire" (The Chronicle, November 5), Scott McLemee says: "Mr. Negri had spent much of the previous two decades in exile, convicted of having fomented civil disorder during the 1970s as the main theorist and eminence grise of a revolutionary group." For the casual reader without a knowledge of Italian history, this sounds like an American radical from the '60s who threw a rock or two in a demonstration.
The sad truth is that Antonio Negri was the intellectual leader of the Red Brigades, a terrorist organization that killed numerous politicians -- including a former prime minister of Italy, Aldo Moro -- and members of the police. â€¦
Even today Negri refuses to criticize the acts of those years.
The article presents highly distorted information regarding the background of Negri and helps to perpetuate the myth that the revolutionaries from the '70s were some type of progressive fighters, when they were nothing more than killers who brought pointless deaths and pain to Europe.

Mr. Negri has denied that he was involved in the Red Brigades, and the Italian government eventually dropped the charge that he had led the group.
