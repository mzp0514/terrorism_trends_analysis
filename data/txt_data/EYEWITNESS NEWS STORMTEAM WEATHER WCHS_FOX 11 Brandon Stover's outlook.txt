Trump plays on fears; vote for Clinton
Editor:
Harry Truman once said, "America wasn't built on fear. Remember that now, as you listen to Donald Trump trying to play to people's fears of crime and terrorism. "We won't have a country left, he says. That's just ridiculous. The fact is that crime is way down from what it was a few years ago and, although terrorism is a problem, there are far worse problems in the world.
Another fact is that the United States is leading a large coalition of countries that are closing in on the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant and systematically picking off its leaders. And America's intelligence agencies have been good at stopping most attacks. ISIL will get through now and then, but they are losing ground.
I don't know what's in the minds of those crazies over there, but I'd guess their aim is to scare people into voting for extremist politicians who are long on bluster and short on brains and who will play right into their hands. Trump will do his best to foment hysteria; a sure sign of weakness.
Hillary is a lot smarter than the pundits at Fox give her credit for. So is Tim Kaine.
