Leaders of al-Qaida lost some control of the terrorist network last year because of the arrests and deaths of top operational planners, but the group remains the most prominent terrorist threat facing the United States and its allies, the State Department said Friday.
In its annual report on worldwide terrorism, the department singled out Iran as the most active state sponsor of terrorism, saying that its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Ministry of Intelligence and Security have been involved directly in the planning and support of terrorist acts.
Overall, the report tallied about 11,000 terrorist attacks around the world last year, resulting in more than 14,600 deaths. That is almost a fourfold increase in attacks from 2004, though the agency attributes the change largely to new ways of tallying the incidents.
At least 10,000 to 15,000 of the approximately 40,000 people killed or wounded worldwide were Muslims, most of them in Iraq, said the National Counterterrorism Center, which provided statistical information to the State Department.
About 3,500 of last year's attacks occurred in Iraq and about 8,300 of the deaths occurred there, accounting for a large part of the increase over 2004.
The report said that Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaida leaders are scattered and on the run and that Afghanistan is no longer a safe haven for the network.
Six countries -- Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria -- remain classified as state sponsors of terror. Libya and Sudan, though, were credited with continuing to take significant steps to cooperate in the global war on terrorism.
