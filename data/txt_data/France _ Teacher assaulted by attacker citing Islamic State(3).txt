PARIS - French anti-terrorism authorities are investigating an attack Monday on a pre-school teacher in a Paris suburb by a masked assailant with a box-cutter and scissors who mentioned the Islamic State group.
The assailant remains at large, and the motive for the attack in the town of Aubervilliers is unclear, authorities said. It comes as France remains under a state of emergency after Nov. 13 attacks by Islamic State-linked extremists that killed 130 people.
In Monday's incident, an attacker in a ski mask and gloves arrived at the Jean Perrin pre-school before class began and attacked the teacher with a box-cutter and scissors, said Philippe Galli, the top government official for the Seine-Saint-Denis region. No children were present, only the teacher and other staff members, Galli told reporters outside the school.
The assailant's identity remains unclear, and a manhunt is underway. French media reports said the teacher did not suffer any life-threatening injuries.
Anti-terrorism investigators are looking into the incident, Paris prosecutor's office spokeswoman Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre said.
Education Minister Najat Vallaud-Belkacem also went to the school, and promised to ensure security at schools around the country.
"It's an act of great gravity," she said. "It is inadmissible."
