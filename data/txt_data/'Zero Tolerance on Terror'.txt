We should not let the fine-crafting of John P. Avlon's merited praise of Mayor Giuliani convince us that Mr. Giuliani understands terrorism ["Zero Tolerance on Terror," Opinion, May 10, 2004].
America has failed to define the war on terrorism properly, to expand it sufficiently, and to persuade the non-Islamist world to embrace it and most Americans of its importance.
Mr. Giuliani cited no evidence for the factors he suggested. Nobody has. Terrorism in the Middle East results not from the Arabs' poverty and repression of women and other faiths, but from their intolerance and violence. For that, there is much evidence. Listen to the mosques' constant exhortations to jihad. Watch the worldwide jihad. Yes, the Arabs do produce poverty and inequality of women. Since few women go in for terrorism, their anger, if they even have it, is not a factor.
Terrorism is an ideology, not an outlet for the impoverished, or else it would be rife in southern Africa. Democracy suits us but might not inhibit terrorism in the Arab culture of bigotry and violence. It might enable their collectively intolerant society to more cleverly direct their war on us.
I wish there were more to Mr. Giuliani's assertion that we now confront terrorism. We do nothing substantial about southern Arabia, Iran, and North Korea. We subsidize the Palestinian Authority, seeking to turn it into a state, and without seeing to it that it ceases terrorism. Nor can we expect it to. Jihadists do not compromise with their religious imperatives. They must be defeated and uprooted.
