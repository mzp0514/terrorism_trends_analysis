Right now, we are sorely in need of leadership from our president. If I may be so bold, here is a statement I believe the president should make, soon.
"Starting today, the policy of the United States of America will be to respect Islam and renounce terrorism. Just as we do not attribute the racism of the Ku Klux Klan to Christianity, we will not attribute the terrorism of al-Qaida or the Taliban to Islam. Just as we do not call the KKK a Christian hate group, we will not call al-Qaida or the Taliban or any other such group Islamic terrorists. Just as we do not use the expression 'Christian racism,' we will not use the expression 'Islamic terrorism.'
"We will continue to recognize that some terrorists use elements of Islam for their purposes. What we will not do is assume that terrorism is somehow inherent to Islam itself. We will not treat every follower of Islam as a potential terrorist, just as we do not treat every Christian as a potential violent racist. People are innocent until proven guilty, and if they are found guilty, it will be on account of their actions, not their religious associations.
"The American way is not merely tolerance of religion, it is freedom of religion. We will respect Islam. And, we renounce terrorism. We will neither condone nor practice terrorism."
When the proposed Islamic center near Ground Zero became an issue, President Barack Obama missed an opportunity to speak about this with courageous leadership. Maybe it's not too late.
