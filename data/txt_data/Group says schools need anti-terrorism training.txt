WASHINGTON -- The nation's public schools are prime targets for terrorists, a national school police officers' association says. It is urging Congress to pay for training on how to thwart a school attack and deal with new types of threats.
The National Association of School Resource Officers says it will ask Congress today to pass an Education Homeland Security Act to finance anti-terrorism training, school security assessments and emergency planning. The group also wants help coordinating school efforts with local police and other agencies.
The federal government provided nearly $ 747 million last year for school safety. In his 2004 budget, President Bush proposes less, about $ 694 million, but the U.S. Education Department has been helping schools develop terrorism plans, says spokesman Dan Langan. He says schools have been preparing for "crises of all kinds, including school shootings and natural disasters. The principles to prepare for these crises can also be applied to acts of terrorism."
In an association survey of 658 school police officers last July, 95% said their schools are vulnerable to terrorism; 79% said their schools are not prepared for an attack. One in three officers said they had actually had less training in responding to terrorism since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
"Much like our airports and our buildings should have been on someone's radar screen before 9/11 because we had credible intelligence, we're saying that you've got to put schools on this radar screen now, not after something happens," says Curt Lavarello, the group's executive director.
The National Association of School Resource Officers represents more than 10,000 officers in 50 states.
