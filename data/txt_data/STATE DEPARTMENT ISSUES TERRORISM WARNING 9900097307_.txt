WASHINGTON -- Americans around the world were warned Saturday by the State Department that there is "credible evidence" terrorists could strike at large holiday gatherings.
A worldwide caution issued by the department told U.S. citizens abroad to avoid large crowds and gatherings and to keep a low profile.
The statement gave no details of the evidence and did not reveal which group may be the cause of the warning.
But a senior U.S. official told The Associated Press that the threat was linked to Osama bin Laden, who the U.S. government believes is the head of a terrorist network and is accused of involvement in the bombings last year of U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
The Saudi-born bin Laden is believed to have been given sanctuary by the militant Islamic Taliban group in Afghanistan.
"The U.S. government has credible information that terrorists are planning attacks specifically targeting American citizens during the period of time leading up to and through the beginning of the New Year and Ramadan events and celebrations," the announcement said.
"The information indicates that attacks could be planned for locations throughout the world where large gatherings and celebrations will be taking place."
It said Americans "traveling or residing abroad during the period are urged to review their security practices, to remain alert to the changing situation and to exercise caution. American citizens should avoid large crowds and gatherings, keep a low profile and vary routes and times of all required travel."
