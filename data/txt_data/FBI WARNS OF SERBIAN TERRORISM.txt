The FBI has warned the U.S. military to be alert for possible Serb-led terrorist attacks inside the United States after several churches received "threats to kill" American soldiers, according to a memo obtained by The Associated Press.
FBI counterterrorism agents sent out the memo last week after Serbian Orthodox churches in the Sacramento, Milwaukee, Chicago and Indianapolis areas received via fax a Serb-language letter urging Serbian Americans to respond violently to NATO strikes on Yugoslavia.
"The threat letter requested that all Serbian nationalists living in America take action against the NATO decision to intervene in the Serbian/Kosovo conflict by killing as many American soldiers in the United States as necessary to stop the NATO attacks in Serbia," according to the FBI memo.
The memo was distributed to military bases and other sensitive federal installations, such as nuclear weapons labs, through a special electronic mail warning system.
Dale Watson, the FBI's deputy assistant director for counterterrorism, declined to discuss the memo but said the church letters aren't the only Serb-related terrorism threats being examined by FBI investigators.
The agency is investigating whether there is any link between the Yugoslav government in Belgrade and the threats in the United States, officials said.
The alert memo warned military commanders nationwide "that there is a credible threat outstanding to take action within the United States against U.S. military personnel."
