Dante Caputo, the Foreign Minister of Argentina, has called his Government's response to a raid by an armed band on a military outpost last month a victory for democracy in Latin America.
In an interview last week, Mr. Caputo, the president of the United Nations General Assembly, said the civilian Government of President Raul Alfonsin has stressed due process in reacting to the Jan. 23 confrontation.
In the attack, about 60 armed members of a leftist group calling itself the People's Resistance Front assaulted La Tablada military base. The front is linked to the People's Revolutionary Army, a leftist group active in the 1970's.
Different Kind of Response
Mr. Caputo said the official response to the raid was a marked change from earlier traditions of lawless paramilitary reprisals and attacks by right-wing death squads. He said such an approach had great significance for South America.
In contrast to earlier practice, he said, television crews freely covered the 36-hour pitched battle in a Buenos Aires suburb. A federal judge was at the scene supervising the treatment of the 17 terrorists who were arrested. Surgeons treated the wounded and the dying, and in the final hours, before the last of the attackers were subdued, President Alfonsin visited the area.
By the time calm was restored, 28 attackers and 11 soldiers and police officers were dead.
Mr. Caputo said that those arrested, as well as a score of others seized later and held on warrants, will be tried in civilian courts on charges that include endangering constitutional order and democracy. The charges could bring sentences of up to 25 years in prison.
The Foreign Minister said that under previous civilian and military regimes in Argentina, responsibility for suppressing such acts had been given to officers who acted outside the law and newspapers and television were discouraged or prevented from reporting the events.
 
Shifting Political Culture
Mr. Caputo insisted that the Government's response to what he called the first act of far-left terrorism since Mr. Alfonsin took office in 1983 reflected profound shifts in political culture that had echoes throughout Latin America.
''Some years ago in the United States, there was a debate about which was the best method to defeat utra-leftist terrorism,'' said Mr. Caputo. ''Some argued that you had to strengthen the military governments of Latin America as a way of stopping Marxist guerrillas. Others thought that the presence of those governments allowed for the expansion of those guerrillas.''
He added that much of South America had opted for democracy and that he viewed his country as a laboratory where constitutional institutions were being tested by events like the January battle.
 
Terrorism 'Is Isolated'
In the 1970's, he said, ''social conditions, domestic politics and international relations'' allowed ''terrorism to find support in our countries.''
''Today,'' he said, ''terrorism in Argentina is isolated. There is not a single political party which has an ambiguous or ambivalent position on it. They have all condemned it as have the trade unions, and this was not at all the case earlier.''
In Argentina, he said, terrorists fed off each other. ''This is what happened when right-wing hawks avenged left-wing terror and threw the whole country into an inferno,'' he said.
''Terrorism is not the bomb as such, it is the detonator that is meant to send society into an explosion.'' He said exponents of the authoritarian culture were hoping the new approach would fail, validating their brutal practices.
''But I believe we are winning this battle,'' he said. ''The trigger mechanism is failing.
''Since the beginning of the '80's there has been democracy as never before in Latin America. This is the new phenomenon at the end of the 20th century, the phenomenon of the impoverished democracy.''
