Dick Thornburgh served as governor of Pennsylvania from 1979 to 1987 and as U.S. attorney general under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. He spoke to the Trib regarding terrorism's growing threat. 
 Q: Do you think America has been sufficiently vigilant when it comes to combating and preventing terrorism? 
A: I think from a law enforcement standard, some major strides have been made since 9/11.  
Bob Mueller as head of the FBI (from 2001 to 2013) went to great lengths to try to share law enforcement intelligence and responsibilities with other federal agencies and with state and local agencies. So I think we have increased our capability in that regard.  
On other fronts, I'm not so sure. 
 Q: What other fronts? 
A: We need to be more vigilant for opportunities to convince the international community and other public and private actors that we are serious about protecting our populace and our institutions from heinous attacks. I'm not sure we've done that. 
I'll go back to when I was attorney general, to Lockerbie (the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people, including four from Southwestern Pennsylvania). It took years to bring (the bomber) to justice. (He) finally got a prison term, (then was) released for supposed medical reasons. 
I'll never forget the image of (him) returning to Libya to cheering crowds, this guy who had been responsible for the deaths of 253 Americans and (17) others. What that taught me is that we've got a long way to go before we convince friends and foes that we are serious about opposing these terrorist activities. 
 Q: What do you consider to be the nation's greatest vulnerability right now when it comes to terrorism? 
A: Probably our greatest vulnerability is a derivative one. It comes from the fact that there has been so little done internationally to cope with these problems that we stand exposed to threats that could well be better met if there were a degree of international cooperation. 
There are a number of treaties that have been adopted around the world to deal with international terrorism. But most of them are of a toothless variety with a lot of posturing and no real equipping. That leads to the question of whether other countries in the world take us seriously when we say that we are serious about fighting terrorism. 
 Q: Do you see any way to rein in the religious fanaticism that seems to motivate most jihadists? 
A: If these folks have the capability to stimulate young people into (committing terrorist acts), then effective political leadership should be able to channel that same fanaticism into recognizing that this is a self-defeating proposition and that they will prosper better as a nation "” or as a member of a religious group "” by seeing that these type of activities are brought to a halt. 
I would certainly welcome religious leaders in the Muslim community standing up and condemning crimes committed in their names. (For the most part), that just doesn't happen. 
Until we crack that nut, I think we are going to remain exposed to the type of terrorism that derives from religious fanatics.
