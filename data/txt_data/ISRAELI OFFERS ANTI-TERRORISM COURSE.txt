WASHINGTON (AP) - An Israeli officer who is wanted by Colombia in connection with allegat ions that he helped train hit squads for drug cartels is offering Americans a two-week anti-terrorism course that includes instruction in rescuing hostages and in sniper techniques.  A company in Chicago is recruiting for the course; a company official said Friday that the first session, scheduled to start Nov. 25 in Israel, probably would be canceled because the applicants lacked the required experience.
Ads that appeared in recent months in journals that are devoted to military and police issues described the Israeli's course as consisting of ''all phases of hands-on anti-terrorism training, ending with a helicopter assault to rescue hostages from built-up areas or from aircraft.'' The training is being conducted by Hod Hahanit, an Israeli security firm run by reserve Col. Yair Klein. Colombia issued an arrest warrant for Klein and another Israeli last month, accusing them of training hit squads for drug cartels.  Klein told police officers who were investigating the case in Israel that he had trained Colombian farmers to protect themselves against leftist guerrillas and that he had been unaware of any connection to the country's drug lords.  Michael Epstein, who runs a security company in Chicago called International Association of Airborne Veterans Ltd., said his company had received the franchise from Hod Hahanit, Hebrew for Spearhead, to ''run foreigners through the Israeli anti-terrorism training.''
