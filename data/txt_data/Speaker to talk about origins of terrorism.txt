The Elgin Community College Humanities Center will welcome Michael McIntyre, director of international studies at DePaul University, from 9:30 to 11:30 a.m. Wednesday, Nov. 18, in the Community/Heritage Room on the Spartan Drive campus, 1700 Spartan Drive, Elgin.
McIntyre will discuss what terrorism is, what causes it, and how to put an end to it.
Included in the discussion are the origins of terrorism in the French Revolution, how some forms of political violence come to be classed as terrorist while others are not, the inconsistency of policies toward terrorism, and the peculiar community of interests between terrorists and those committed to a "war on terrorism" in maintaining the efficacy of terror.
The event is free and open to the public.
McIntyre received his Ph.D. in political science from the University of Chicago in 1992 and has, since 2001, served as chair of the Department of International Studies at DePaul University. His interest in terrorism dates to the reign of terror in Central America in the 1980s and continues to the current day.
