An Army paratrooper from Fredericksburg died Thursday after being injured by a bomb in Miri, Afghanistan, military officials reported yesterday.
 Sgt. Dustin Perrott, 23, was a member of the 82nd Airborne Division based at Fort Bragg, N.C. He joined the Army in March 2004 and reported to the 82nd Airborne in August that year.
 "Sergeant Perrott was a tremendous paratrooper who had been a leader in this organization for a long time. He was the kind of leader that infused others with motivation," said Lt. Col. Timothy McAteer, Commander, 2nd Battalion, 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment. "You just couldn't help but smile when you talked to him. He will be sorely missed by all of us who knew him, and our thoughts are with his family during their time of grief."
 Perrott had a previous deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom from December 2004 to March 2005.
 His awards and decorations include the Bronze Star Medal, the Purple Heart, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, the Overseas Service Ribbon, the NATO Medal, the Combat Infantryman's Badge and the Parachutist Badge.
 He is survived by his wife, Anna Marie Perrott of Fayetteville, N.C.
