In a defeat for the Bush administration, one of seven men accused of plotting to join with al-Qaida to blow up Chicago's Sears Tower was acquitted Thursday, and the case against the rest ended in a hung jury.
Federal prosecutor Richard Gregorie said the government planned to retry the six early next year.
The White House had said the case illustrated the dangers of homegrown terrorism and showed the government's post-Sept. 11 success in infiltrating and blocking terrorism plots in their earliest stages.
Lyglenson Lemorin, 32, had been accused of being a "soldier" for alleged ringleader Narseal Batiste. He buried his face in his hands when his acquittal was read. 
Lemorin, a legal U.S. resident originally from Haiti, was subject to an immigration hold and would not be immediately released, his lawyer said.
The jury gave up on the other defendants after nine days of deliberations on four terrorism-related conspiracy charges. U.S. District Judge Joan Lenard declared a mistrial after the jury sent three notes indicating they could not reach verdicts.
Prosecutors charged that the seven Miami men, who included immigrants from Haiti and the Dominican Republic, had sworn allegiance to al-Qaida and hoped to bomb America's tallest skyscraper and other targets.
The group never actually made contact with al-Qaida and never acquired any weapons or explosives. Instead, a paid FBI informant known as Brother Mohammed posed as an al-Qaida emissary.
The defense portrayed the seven men as hapless figures who were either entrapped by the FBI or went along to con "Mohammed" out of $50,000.
