(RTTNews) - The United States will provide $4.1 million worth of security equipment, including troop carriers and bulletproof vests, to the Pakistani police in that country&apos;s troubled North West Frontier Province (NWFP) to bolster their capability to counter terrorism, media reports said.
The assistance is part of the U.S. government&apos;s ongoing Border Security project with the Pakistani government. The equipment will be used to support counter-narcotics and anti-terrorism activities by Pakistan.
Lynne Tracy, principal officer of the U.S. consulate in Peshawar, handed over the first consignment of troop carriers, motorcycles, ballistic helmets and bulletproof vests to NWFP chief minister Ameer Haider Khan Hoti Wednesday.
More equipment, including water tankers, an ambulance, a tow truck and a mobile workshop, will be delivered to the NWFP police within the next three months.
The United States is increasing its funding and training to Pakistan&apos;s Frontier forces, including a paramilitary force Frontier Corps, for combating terrorism in the tribal regions on the Afghan border, which are considered as a safe haven for Al-Qaeda and Taliban militants.
