Body


Two nonpartisan groups, the World Trade Center Tampa Bay and the Florida Council of Churches, will co-host a panel discussion this week on whether the United States should take Cuba off a list of state sponsors of terrorism, end the 51-year-old trade embargo and ease travel restrictions.
At 11 a.m. Wednesday at the Hilton Tampa Downtown (formerly the Hyatt Regency), a panel will discuss legal, social, cultural and economic issues related to Cuba and their impact on the Tampa Bay area. It includes:
- John B. Grandoff III, Tampa attorney with Hill Ward Henderson.
- Rob Lorei, news and public affairs director for WMNF-FM.
- Annie Betancourt, former state representative and member of the board of directors of the League of Women Voters of Florida.
- Bill Hauf, president of Island Travel and Tours, the licensed airline operator for charters to Cuba.
- Ralph Fernandez, Tampa attorney and longtime anti-Castro regime activist.
The event is open to the public, but seating is limited and reservations are required. Tickets, which include lunch, are $40 or $500 for a corporate table of eight.
