A Boise man accused of crimes in both Utah and Idaho has been convicted on federal charges of funneling money to a terrorist group in his home country and making a bomb.
On Wednesday, an Idaho jury convicted Fazliddin Kurbanov, 33, of conspiring and attempting to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization ccc the Islamic Movement of Uzebekistan ccc and possessing an unregistered destructive device. The jury also found the Uzbek national not guilty of two other charges.
Kurbanov's conviction in the three-year-old case followed a 20-day trial and the jury's two-day deliberation.
Besides supporting the terrorist group, Kurbanov procured materials to make a bomb "in the interest of perpetrating a terrorist attack on American soil," Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Carlin said in a statement.
Sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 10. Kurbanov faces a maximum of 15 years in prison on each of the conspiracy and attempt counts, and 10 years for the bomb.
In 2013, Kurbanov was also separately indicted by a federal grand jury in Utah. Federal investigators allege that in January that year, he provided instructions on how others could make their own bombs.
The Utah case will move forward once Kurbanov's been sentenced in Idaho.
