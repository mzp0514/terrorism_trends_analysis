People all over the city are reaching out to New Yorkers and annoying the Republicans, and I think that has some impact. It's not letting the Republicans have center stage.
JEFF GRUBLER
Ronald Reagan Home For The Criminally Insane Bartender, San Francisco
We are willing to risk arrest because we are so horrified by this war. There's no better time than this, even to spend one night in jail given what this administration is doing.
RUTH BENN
War Resisters League Bookkeeper/desktop publisher Brooklyn, N.Y.
If we are calling this terrorism, where 3,000 people are killed, then we must also call it terrorism when we are bombing Baghdad and Afghanistan, killing tens of thousands of people. If it's terrorism here, it's terrorism there.
MIKE LEVINSON
War Resisters League Library clerk New Rochelle, N.Y.
Johnny Cash came from poor people. ... For these people to get up here in his name would make him roll over in his grave. And I could never listen to another Johnny Cash song if I wasn't here to take up for him.
BOB McLANE
NoRespectPublishing.com Bumper sticker designer/salesman, Shreveport, La.

JOSEPH AGOSTINI
Republican Party of Florida Press secretary, Tallahassee
