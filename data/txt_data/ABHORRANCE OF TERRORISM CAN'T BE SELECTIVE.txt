To the Editor:
It is time to acknowledge that semantics neither change nor justify the end results of violence: Rigid thinking and extremist temperament convert ''guerrilla leaders'' into terrorists who are not liberators of their people.  Rather, they make them victims of their own private furies and of their political ambitions.
Frieda lewis letter favors governments' unequivocal condemnation of terrorsim and terrorist tactics
Commenting on British rule and attitudes toward terror, John P.  Scanlon writes (Op-Ed May 7) that Prime Minister Thatcher ''will not do business with those who would impose their will by violence....'' How then, he asks, does she explain the conduct of her Foreign Secretary, who promotes the cause of Yasir Arafat and the P.L.O.?
This is the crux of the matter: Governments and individuals must finally agree to totally reject violent tactics, without exception for their favored terrorists. The bullet that kills is just as lethal, whether it comes from the gun of a thug or the gun of a ''liberator.'' The act must be seen for what it is, and condemned. If democracies such as England and Western Germany cannot hew a clear, straight line and are prepared to legitimize the P.L.O., how can we ever present a united front against political violence?
FRIEDA S. LEWIS, National President, Hadassah, New York, May 8, 1981
