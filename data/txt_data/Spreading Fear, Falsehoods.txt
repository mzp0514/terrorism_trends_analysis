TO THE EDITORS:
For the past 15 years, we have never been ashamed to align ourselves with the hundreds of internationals we've lived among. However, we are very ashamed today to align ourselves with this newspaper which we help deliver.
To those of you to whom we delivered the Nov. 10 paper, we apologize! And to our international friends ... will you forgive us? You are deserving of honor. Your lives of integrity, hospitality and service put us to shame. The last thing we want to do is spread fear and falsehoods.
We are addressing the article concerning the Millersville International House with the bold subtitle, "Terrorism concern raised in Millersville." Please! We sincerely hope you can rise above sensationalism in your journalism. Surely you are called to higher things than the unnecessary spreading of unjustified fear.
One definition of terror is "the use of extreme fear in order to coerce people." If that is so then, yes, there is great concern of terrorism throughout Lancaster County - anywhere this paper has landed!
As for us, our doors remain wide open to the internationals who have enriched our lives and expanded our hearts. We'd recommend you do the same.
Dan and Jenny Gehman
Millersville
(Editor's Note: Dan Gehman is the International House's director of residential services.)
