BEIJING -- A court in the western Chinese region of Xinjiang has sentenced 25 people to prison for taking part in ''terrorist'' activities and ''harboring criminals,'' according to a report on Tuesday by People's Court Daily, an official publication.
The names of the 25 people sentenced indicated that they were all from the Uighur ethnic minority. The largely Muslim group populates several parts of the Xinjiang region, including a belt of southern oasis towns. In recent years, there have been growing tensions between many Uighurs and members of the Han ethnic group, which makes up the majority in China.
The sentences, issued by a court under the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, a powerful state entity that oversees large areas of farmland and other industries in Xinjiang, ranged from three years in prison to life imprisonment.
The People's Court Daily report said that in one case, the people sentenced had tried to spread jihad and had bought broadswords, made explosives, planned attacks on police stations and plotted assassinations of Communist Party officials. Violence has been growing in Xinjiang, and official Chinese news organizations have carried varying accounts about the motivations of the attackers.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
