Protecting the commissioners: Butler County President Judge Thomas Doerr has ordered a deputy sheriff to be stationed at the county commissionersÐ²Ð‚â„¢ office suite. Fear of terrorism? Irate taxpayers? Naaah. DoerrÐ²Ð‚â„¢s just trying to protect the commissioners and their staffs from each other. Commissioner James Eckstein, a Democrat, has been feuding with his GOP counterparts and things have been getting heated on the fifth floor of the government center. LetÐ²Ð‚â„¢s hope DoerrÐ²Ð‚â„¢s move has embarrassed the sides into behaving themselves. 
Small Business Saturday: This program encouraging Christmas shoppers to make purchases at local, privately owned retailers instead of the national chains occurred over the weekend. Unfortunately, it seems few folks are aware of it. Too bad. Our local retailers carry most of the same products as the chains and often have different and interesting inventory not available at the mall or the big box store. Plus, many offer free services, including delivery. Please, keep our local retailers in mind this season. 
Be careful out there: PennsylvaniaÐ²Ð‚â„¢s 12-day firearm deer season began Monday. It runs through Dec. 8 (with no Sunday hunting). Unfortunately, some, in their zeal to bag a buck or down a doe, will take safety shortcuts. HereÐ²Ð‚â„¢s hoping that kind of hunter will be in short supply. And hereÐ²Ð‚â„¢s to a record harvest, one that will reward hunters and a large herd that requires regular culling for its benefit Ð²Ð‚â€ and motoristsÐ²Ð‚â„¢.
