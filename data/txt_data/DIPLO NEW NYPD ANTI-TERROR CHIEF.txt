POLICE COMMISSIONER Raymond Kelly yesterday tapped a diplomat and former federal prosecutor to helm the NYPD's terror-fighting bureau.
Richard Daddario, 59, the Justice Department's attach√© in Moscow, will assume his new post in August.
He replaces Richard Falkenrath, who resigned recently to take a job in the private sector.
Daddario's most notable experience with terrorism comes as a prosecutor, when he led probes as an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan in the late 1990s, according to a statement released by Kelly.
In his current position, the longtime Manhattan resident provides legal counsel to the U.S. Embassy and works with Russian law enforcement officials on terrorism and drug trafficiking.
Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne, the NYPD's top spokesman, said Daddario was recommended to Kelly and that he was selected over a number of "highly qualified candidates."
Daddario's job, Browne said, is no different that the three men who held the post before him.
"The mission doesn't really change," Browne said. "It's to protect the city from another attack. We feel there will be plenty of opportunities to do that. All indications are the homegrown threat remains apace, if not accelerated."
