In "Obama's Liberalism" (July 9), the letter writer blames President Barack Obama for just about all the ills in the United States - specifically racial tension, terrorism and cause groups. Wow! What a guy that President Obama is.
Steve Schlauch mentioned the George Zimmerman and Freddie Gray cases and said they had nothing to do with race. He did not include many examples from New York, Louisiana, Minnesota and elsewhere, where race was more obviously involved. Choosing to blame nothing on race is like blaming everything on race. Mr. Obama seems to have tried to deal with it. Realization leads to discussion, which leads to solutions.
As for blaming the creation of groups like Black Lives Matter on the current president: I don't recall any other presidents credited with responsibility for the Klan or white supremacists.
Terrorism stretches its beginning into another administration in which the Twin Towers fell and the "Mission Accomplished" group was wrong. Eighty to 90 percent of the public sees value in gun registration and regulation. So in this point, Mr. Obama is following the people's wishes.
The attempt to blame Mr. Obama clouded common sense, leaving just anti-Obama talking points. Liberalism and Mr. Obama didn't create these -- "We the people" did - and "We the people" should take responsibility to solve them.
