The Casualty Care Research Center in Bethesda, Md., reports that in any given year, the FBI engages in approximately two dozen domestic terrorism investigations.
In the United States, most terrorist incidents have involved individuals or small extremist groups that use terrorism to achieve a designated objective, the center reports.
A terrorist attack can take several forms, depending on the technological means available to the terrorist, the nature of the political issue motivating the attack and the weaknesses of the terrorist's target.
In 1993, 11 domestic terrorist incidents took place in the United States. Nine of the 11 all happened on a single night when animal rights activists placed small incendiary devices in four Chicago department sto res that sell furs.
In 1997, the FBI recorded two terrorist incidents and two suspected acts of terrorism on U.S. soil. Within the same year, 21 potential acts of terrorism were prevented in the United States, the highest number of recorded preventions since 1985, when 23 planned acts of terrorism were prevented.
Even the threat of anthrax is nothing new to the country, the center study reports. Since 1998, the FBI's National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime investigated more than 250 anthrax threats.
