WASHINGTON -- More than seven in 10 say the threat of terrorism has brought no extra stress or anxiety in their lives, says a new poll taken after the nation was put on a heightened state of terrorism alert.
Almost three in 10, 27 percent, said they felt extra anxiety because of the threat of terrorism, but only 8 percent said they felt a great deal of extra stress and anxiety, according to the ABC News-Washington Post poll taken from Wednesday through Sunday.
A fourth, 24 percent, said they have stockpiled supplies and another 12 percent were considering it. The most popular items were food and water. Only 3 percent said they had stocked up on duct tape.
Overall, about a third in the poll said they are worried that they personally might become the victim of a terrorist attack. Only one in 10 expressed a great deal of such worry. Those levels are about the same as last fall and in November 2001, just two months after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.
The concern level varies among men and women.
Four in 10 women said they are worried about being a victim of terrorism, while just 25 percent of men would say they are worried about becoming a victim.
The poll of 1,042 adults has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
