Highlight: UK police say 3 schoolgirls who went to Syria won't be charged with terrorism if they return
Body


 - Three British schoolgirls who traveled to Syria to join the Islamic State group won't be prosecuted for terrorism if they return, a senior British police officer said Tuesday.
Police chiefs also defended their handling of the case, denying a lawmaker's allegation that the failure to stop the teens was a huge blow to the credibility of the force.
Mark Rowley, head of counterterrorism for the Metropolitan Police, told lawmakers that we have no evidence to support (the teens') involvement in terrorism.
The journey of the three 15- and 16-year-olds last month shocked many in Britain, left their families bewildered and highlighted the difficulty of halting the radicalization of young Muslims. Relatives say police failed to inform them that a school friend of the teens had gone to Syria in December. 
They say if they had known, they would have looked for any warning signals of radicalization.
They also accused the police of not acting quickly enough once they reported the girls missing.
I feel so let down by the police, because we gave them everything, said Sahima Begum, sister of one of the girls. We gave them every piece of information.
The families of Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and 15-year-old Amira Abase are angry that they were not informed that police had spoken to their daughters shortly after their friend disappeared in December.
