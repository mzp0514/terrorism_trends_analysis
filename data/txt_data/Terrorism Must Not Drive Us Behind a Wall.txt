To the Editor:
Americans seems to be a growing target for terrorism in recent years: the World Trade Center, Oklahoma City, perhaps Trans World Airlines Flight 800 and now the bombing at the Atlanta Olympics (front page, July 28). Yet terrorism exists in many parts of the world. We must work with friendly governments to stop this trend, not revert to isolationism.
As a retired captain for T.W.A. who has many times flown both Flight 800 and that specific 747 jumbo jet, I was struck by the memorial service on the beach at Fire Island on Monday (front page, July 23). It was a touching tribute, ending with the family members and friends of the victims sending flowers into the ocean as a salute to those who were lost. And to realize that even as the ceremony was taking place, hundreds of others were concentrating on the search and recovery is a tribute to all those involved in that effort.
We must work to offer greater security for our citizens without hampering free movement. We cannot lock ourselves in our homes.
Had I not retired, I might have been the captain that night on Flight 800. My wife might have been a passenger, on her way to Paris to join me for an overnight stay. Yet I would still fly that flight without fear, and I will not be intimidated by any individual or organization.
The price of freedom has been paid for with the lives lost on T.W.A. Flight 800 and through other terrorist acts. We cannot allow their sacrifices to cause us to take a step backward.
