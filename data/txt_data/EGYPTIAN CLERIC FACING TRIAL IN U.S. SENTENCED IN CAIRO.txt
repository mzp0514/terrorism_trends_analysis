A radical Egyptian clergyman awaiting trial in the United States in a purported terrorism plot was convicted on unrelated charges Thursday and sentenced by an Egyptian court to seven years at hard labor.
Among the Egyptian charges against Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman were illegal possession of a firearm and attempting to kill two policemen during a 1989 demonstration.
He was acquitted of the same charges four years ago.
"It is a very unjust sentence," the sheik's son, Abdullah, 18, said from the family home in Fayoum 50 miles south of Cairo. "It is political because the government is against Islam."
Abdullah said his father will learn of the verdict today when he calls his family.
Despite the conviction on retrial, it was unlikely the sheik, 55, who is blind and diabetic, will serve time in an Egyptian prison.
He was indicted in August on allegations that he conspired with a group which U.S. authorities say planned to commit bombings, kidnappings and murders in the New York area.
A U.S. judge has ruled he is "a danger to the security of the United States" and cannot leave a federal prison 70 miles north of New York City. He has been there since surrendering last July to face charges that he lied to obtain legal residency in the United States.
