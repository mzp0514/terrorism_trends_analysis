The NYPD has come up with its own guide to terrorism.
The list of anti-terrorism tips given to police officers last week warns cops that signs as subtle as a sparsely furnished home or untaxed cigarettes in a business could point to terrorist activity.
But the two-sided sheet, titled "Possible Indicators of Terrorist Activity," also points out some of the more obvious tips to terrorism.
The guide advises cops to watch for anyone videotaping bridges, storing blueprints of possible targets or carrying several driver's licenses.
Cops should also watch out for anyone who "expresses hatred for America and advocates violence against America and/or Americans."
Authors of the guide, meant to fit in a patrol cop's memo book, stress that it's "general" and the indicators do "not necessarily mean that terrorist activity is being planned."
Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said the guide's broadness may intrude on people's rights.
"Criticism of our country is supposed to be protected by the First Amendment," she said.
NYPD spokesman Paul Browne said the guide was not designed to thwart peaceful protests but to equip cops with more knowledge on how to fight terrorism.
