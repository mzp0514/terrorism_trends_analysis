SALT LAKE CITY - A man who claimed he was only joking when he said he'd fire an assault rifle at a community swimming pool has been charged.
Brock Braxton Lee Allred, of Elmo, Carbon County, who turned 18 just a month before the alleged incident, was charged Thursday in 7th District Court with making a threat of terrorism, a third- degree felony.
On Nov. 20, Allred posted a picture of Price City Desert Wave Pool on his Snapchat account with the caption, "50 screenshots and I'll shoot this dome with an AR," according to a police affidavit.
Police went to Carbon High School to locate Allred and pulled him out of class for questioning.
"When asked, Brock explained he had seen similar posts from other kids in the school and thought he was just joining into the fun. When asked if the other kids had done what he had, Brock admitted the other kids had not gone to the lengths he had, further admitting he had gone much further than any other kid had," according to the jail booking affidavit.
Police noted in their affidavit that if they had not "found Brock when we did, it was very likely the wave pool may have been shut down and the public evacuated, preventing the occupation and operation due to the threat of it being shot at with a high-powered rifle."
