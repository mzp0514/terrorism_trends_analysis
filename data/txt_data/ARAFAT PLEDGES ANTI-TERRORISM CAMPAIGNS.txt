JERICHO, West Bank (AP) PLO chief Yasser Arafat today pledged to wage a new campaign against terrorism, a move hailed by Vice President Al Gore as an important step in support of the Middle East peace effort.
After meeting with Gore in this PLO-run desert oasis, Arafat said he would set up new state security courts.
"Those who will try to jeopardize and harm peace and security will be prosecuted," he said.
Gore said the Palestine Liberation Organization leader had made clear he would proceed with "criminal prosecution of those who are suspected of terrorist activities."
"This is an important step forward in helping to build confidence in the peace process and in the effort by authorities on all sides to control violence and stop terrorism and defeat enemies of the peace process," Gore said.
Israel had demanded that Arafat rein in terrorists as the price for expanding Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank. Arafat said "there are enemies of peace on both sides" who are trying to jeopardize the security in the region.
Gore announced a $ 73 million U.S. aid package for development and public works in the Gaza Strip. He also said President Clinton had authorized Palestinians to export a range of goods to the United States, duty-free, from the West Bank on Gaza. The move will allow more than 4,600 agricultural and industrial products to be shipped into the United States without tariffs.
