A federal judge  Thursday  imposed four life sentences on failed underwear bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who tried to blow up a Detroit-bound jet on Christmas Day 2009.
"The defendant has never expressed doubt or regret or remorse about his mission," U.S District Judge Nancy Edmunds told the 25-year-old Nigerian student who became an al-Qaeda operative.  "To the contrary, he sees that mission as divinely inspired and a continuing mission.
"I believe the defendant poses a significant ongoing threat to the safety of American citizens everywhere," Edmunds said.
Abdulmutallab pleaded guilty  in  October to eight counts, including conspiring to commit an act of terrorism. On Thursday, he told Edmunds: "The mujahedin are proud to kill in the name of God, and this is exactly what God told us to do in the Quran."
Edmunds imposed the sentence after several passengers on Northwest Flight 253 talked about how the failed bombing attempt had  changed their lives, causing them to fear flying, seek mental health counseling and have  nightmares.
LeMare Mason, a Northwest flight attendant who put out the flames when Abdulmutallab's bomb fizzled, told Edmunds: "I had a dream job traveling the world. This man has stolen and robbed me of the pleasure of going to work."
Shama Chopra, a passenger from Montreal and mother of two, said she has had to overcome the fear of flying since the incident.
