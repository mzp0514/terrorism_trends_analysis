(RTTNews) - Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani Monday has asked the US to bridge the existing "trust-deficit" with his country, and provide drone technology and sharing actionable intelligence to bolster his government&apos;s efforts to combat militancy.
In his talks Monday with an American delegation led by Senator Carl Levin, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Gilani "underscored the imperative of bridging the existing trust-deficit between Pakistan and the U.S." for the long-term partnership between the two countries.
He rejected misperceptions about the existence of Quetta Shura or the Afghan Taliban leadership in Pakistan, and reiterated his country&apos;s desire to fence its border with Afghanistan.
Gilani called for the speedy disbursement of "long-overdue payments under the Coalition Support Fund" for reimbursing Pakistan&apos;s expenses in the war on terror and removal of the country from the list of 14 nations whose citizens are being subjected to additional screening when they go to the U.S. by air.
Though Cuba, Iran, the Sudan and Syria are currently on the State Department&apos;s list of countries deemed to be "state sponsors of terrorism," Pakistan has been included along with these countries in the air travel directive, as it is considered the epicenter of terrorism.
Senator Levin appreciated Pakistan&apos;s critical and vital role as the front-line state in the war against terror, as also Islamabad&apos;s resolve and commitment to eradicate terrorism. He also lauded the success achieved by Pakistan&apos;s armed forces in Malakand and South Waziristan regions.
