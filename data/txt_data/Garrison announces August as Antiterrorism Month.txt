Whereas, the vitality of West Point and our surrounding communities depends on how safe we keep our homes, neighborhoods, schools, workplaces and communities;
Whereas, terrorist acts create fear and destroy our trust in civic institutions, threatening the communities' health, prosperity and quality of life;
Whereas, people of all ages must be made aware of what they can do to prevent themselves and their families, neighbors and co-workers from being harmed by terrorists;
Whereas, people of all ages must be made aware of the dangers of terrorist activities and how they can protect themselves from becoming victims of terrorism;
Whereas, the personal injury, financial loss and impact to communities from terrorists' attacks are intolerable and require investment from the whole community;
Whereas, preventing and defeating terrorism includes community protection and security, we must go beyond these to promote self-awareness and self-protection to make Army communities safer for all ages and to develop positive opportunities and a bright future for young people;
Whereas, adults must invest time and resources to understand and support effective antiterrorism prevention, deterrence, detection and defense; adults must also engage our youth to ensure they adopt a proactive mindset of personal protection;
Whereas, effective antiterrorism plans and programs succeed because of partnerships with law enforcement, security, other government agencies, civic groups, schools, faith communities, business and individuals as they help to raise community awareness and responsibility and install pride and sustained vigilance;
Now, therefore, I, Col. Landy D. Dunham, garrison commander, do hereby proclaim August 2014 as Antiterrorism Awareness Month in the West Point community and urge all citizens, government agencies, public and private institutions and businesses to invest in the power of prevention and work together to make West Point and our surrounding communities a safer and stronger place to live.
