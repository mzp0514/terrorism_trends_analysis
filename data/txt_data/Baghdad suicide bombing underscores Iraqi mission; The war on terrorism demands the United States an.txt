Tuesday's suicide attack on U.N. headquarters in Baghdad underscores both the difficulty of the U.S. mission in Iraq and its importance.
A massive truck bomb tore into the hotel that served as the United Nations' base of operations in Iraq.
At least 17 were killed and scores were wounded. Among the dead was Sergio Vieira de Mello, a Brazilian who was serving as the top U.N. official in Iraq.
The attack is the latest evidence that terrorists are asserting themselves following the toppling of Saddam Hussein's repressive regime by a U.S.-led coalition. Acts of sabotage, including the torching of an important oil pipeline, have increased. Meanwhile, attacks on American military personnel persist. The death toll among Americans in the months since major hostilities ended now rivals that of the initial military campaign.
Iraq, meanwhile, is in need of much investment. Its power grid, roads, water supplies, schools, hospitals, police and military are all inadequate.
Clearly, stabilizing Iraq will not be easy, but it is a necessary step in the fight against global terrorism. Stability in this part of the world, after all, is one of the conditions necessary for combating global terrorism. It is the best reason the United States had for toppling Saddam's dangerous regime, and now it is the reason the United States and its allies should stay the course in Iraq.
