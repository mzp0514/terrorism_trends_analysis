President Bush's newest budget proposal is a shocker, if you can believe it. He predicts higher taxes for the middle class, the disappearance of terrorism, less spending on the nation's poor, sick, and retired, and no more recessions.
He didn't dare say so in words, but the implications of his numerical projections are clear. The budget gets balanced by 2012, but only if nothing is spent on the war on terror for the previous three years. He counts on higher taxes on the middle class, yet assumes no slowdown of the robust economy.
His approach to the long-term shortages faced by Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security is to begin cutting benefits. For 2008, some Medicaid cuts are proposed that would break the budgets of hospitals that serve the poor. Tampa General Hospital would lose $64 million a year.
The reality is that Congress won't, and shouldn't, let those painful Medicaid cuts stand. And here are some other realities: Taxes won't go up sharply, and if they do, economic growth will suffer. The costly war on terrorism will continue in some corner of the world, and entitlement spending won't be reduced.
Direct payments to individuals are nearly 60 percent of the federal budget and rising steadily. Congress won't even talk about what to do about that.
For the 2008 budget year, Bush plans to spend $2.9 trillion and collect only $2.66 trillion in revenue. That's not a problem, we are told, because everything gets better in the future. If you can believe it.
