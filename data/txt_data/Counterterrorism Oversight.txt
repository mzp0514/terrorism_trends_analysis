To the Editor:
  In an Aug. 31 letter, Michael Leiter, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, dismisses the concerns you raised in ''The Troubled Terrorism List'' (editorial, Aug. 24) as based on a press release from the oversight subcommittee of the House Committee on Science and Technology.
  Our questions were derived from the National Counterterrorism Center's internal documents. The agency has not disputed the authenticity of those documents, nor rebutted the gist of the criticisms of the database.
  The frequent inclusion of comically improbable terrorism suspects -- small children or commercial pilots -- on the Transportation Security Administration watch list, the best-known product of the National Counterterrorism Center's database, has been an inconvenience. But more serious is what is not in the database. The center's documents show that critical information about suspected terrorists is not entered, and that the database's search technology cannot find much of what is.
  The subcommittee urges the National Counterterrorism Center to release all nonclassified assessments of the database's performance and calls for an independent investigation. The agency's account should not be treated as gospel.
   (Rep.) Brad Miller

  The writer is chairman of the Investigation and Oversight Subcommittee of the House Committee on Science and Technology.
