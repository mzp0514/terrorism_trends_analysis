STRASBOURG, France â€” The man authorities believe killed three people during a rampage near a Christmas market in Strasbourg died Thursday in a shootout with police at the end of a two-day manhunt, French authorities said. The Paris prosecutor's office, which handles terror cases in France, formally identified the man killed in the eastern French city as 29-year-old Cherif Chekatt, a Strasbourg-born man with a long history of convictions for various crimes, including robberies. The suspect also had been on a watch list of potential extremists. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner, speaking earlier from Strasbourg, said police had spotted a man matching the suspect's description in the city's Neudorf neighborhood. "The moment they tried to arrest him, he turned around and opened fire. They replied," killing the man, Castaner said. He was suspected of killing three people and wounding 13 near Strasbourg's Christmas market on Tuesday night. Castaner said earlier Thursday that three of the injured had been released from hospital and three others were still fighting for their lives. "Our engagement against terrorism is total," French President Emmanuel Macron, who was in Brussels for a European Union summit, said in a tweet thanking security forces.
