The Palestinian delegation has profusely thanked the International Olympic Committee for barring a minute of silence at Friday night's opening ceremonies in memory of the terror attack that killed 11 Israelis at the Munich Games 40 years ago.
"Sports are a bridge for love, communication and the spreading of peace between nations and should not be used for divisiveness and the spread of racism," Palestinian representative Jibril Rajoub wrote - demonstrating exactly why the IOC was dreadfully wrong to refuse the remembrance.
A Palestinian terrorist group, Black September, perpetrated the atrocity. In Rajoub's view, noting its role in an event that was a milestone in the histories of both the Olympics and terrorism would create "divisiveness" and contribute to "the spread of racism."
Only a mindset forged in the belief that using terror is legitimate could find divisiveness in standing against the murder of innocents.
Only someone who equates the existence of a Jewish state with the oppression of Muslims and Arabs could see the promotion of racism in recalling that Palestinians killed Israelis.
IOC Chief Jacques Rogge gave succor to those views when he should have made a globally unifying statement against terrorism by anyone.
