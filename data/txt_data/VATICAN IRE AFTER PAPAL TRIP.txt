ROME, March 11 - The Vatican radio today denounced with unaccustomed severity events that marred the visit by Pope John Paul II to Nicaragua and Guatemala.In Guatemala, six men convicted of terrorism were executed just before the Pope arrived and in defiance of a papal plea for mercy.  In Managua, the Nicaraguan capital, a mass celebrated by the Pope was interrupted by heckling organized by the ruling Sandinists.
The radio commentary criticized that it called ''two unheard-of affronts.'' It described the heckling during mass as a ''profanation'' and accused the Sandinists of a ''vulgar, indecent'' act.
The Vatican radio commentator was even harsher in denouncing the Guatemalan Government, saying, ''The other act, more subtle and contemptuous on the part of the Guatemalan authorities, which a few days before the arrival of the Pontiff in their nation executed by firing squad six persons condemned by a phantom special court.''
''Contempt of any form of good manners and clumsy propaganda manipulation on one hand; on the other arrogance, even 'drunkenness of power,' as a newspaper called it, on the part of those who pretend to kill in the name of God,'' the Vatican radio continued in denouncing Nicaragua and Guatemala, respectively.
