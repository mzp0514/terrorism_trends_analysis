Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi issued a strong denunciation of terrorism Thursday and said the United States should make the next move for improving ties.
The denunciation came in a joint statement by Gadhafi and Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, who was making the first visit to Libya by a Western leader since U.N. sanctions against the North African country were lifted in April.
The two leaders said in a statement that their governments "underlined the necessity of denying sustenance and protection to those responsible for terrorist acts."
Libya had been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 as Britain and the United States demanded it hand over two of its nationals accused of being behind the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland. The blast killed 270 people. The sanctions were suspended after Libya surrendered the two for trial in the Netherlands.
In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin said the United States had noted positive signs emanating from Libya.
"We are watching Libyan behavior very carefully, and we've acknowledged that Libya has made a number of statements of intent to change its behavior," Rubin said.
 
But he said "these steps don't satisfy all of our concerns."
D'Alemi said his country would "fulfill the role of being a bridge between Libya and the world."
