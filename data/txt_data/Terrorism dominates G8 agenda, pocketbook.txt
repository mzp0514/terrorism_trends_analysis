A $20 billion deal designed to stop terrorists from getting hold of nuclear bombs nudged Africa out of the spotlight yesterday, but a summit of rich nations promised not to ignore the world's poorest continent next year.
The leaders of the Group of Eight industrialized nations, guarded by tanks, soldiers and batteries of anti-aircraft guns in two days of closed-door talks, also called for Palestinian reforms, although they stopped short of endorsing a U.S. plan that says Yasser Arafat should go.
In line with year-old promises, they drew up a development package for Africa, but the Africa Action Plan offered a lot of advice and little in the way of cash.
They also promised $20 billion to help Russia dismantle weapons of mass destruction and keep extremist groups "from acquiring or developing nuclear, chemical, radiological and biological weapons," a G8 statement said.
Terrorism has long been a topic at annual summits of the Group of Eight, where the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States often appear to be seeking things to agree about in a series of broad-brush assessments of international affairs.
But the issue took on new urgency this year after the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States.
They also voiced support for the transitional administration in Afghanistan and for Latin American reform.
To avoid the kind of violence that plagued last year's summit in Italy, the session was held this year in the sealed-off bubble of Kananaskis, an exclusive resort surrounded by wilderness.
The only casualty was a Kananaskis bear, killed by a sharpshooter when it got too close to the proceedings.
