The New York State Bar Association on Tuesday issued a report spotlighting a crisis in the quality and availability of legal representation of immigrants in New York.
The report of the Special Committee on Immigration Representation also makes recommendations for improvement, including written standards for immigration representation. It cites a “dire” shortage of attorneys qualified in immigration issues, insufficient safeguards to protect immigrants from unauthorized or unqualified practitioners, and the need for more educational programs and pro bono participation to assist low-income immigrants.
The report singles out amendments made to federal immigration laws in 1996 relating to terrorism and illegal immigration as having “contributed significantly” to the current crisis.
Immigrants subjected to immigration removal proceedings often cannot afford to retain adequate legal representation, do not know how to obtain it, or are ill-equipped to represent themselves, according to the report. Language issues and cultural differences may exacerbate the problems, leaving some non-citizens vulnerable to unscrupulous or unqualified representation.
The 49-page report was approved by the association’s House of Delegates at its June 23 meeting in Cooperstown. It is available at www.nysba.org/immigrationreport.
