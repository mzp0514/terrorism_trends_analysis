And you can tell everybody, this is your ... address.
The British government did tell everybody Elton John's address along with those of other famous people in an embarrassing gaffe late Friday and early Saturday.
British officials published the addresses of celebrities, politicians and more than 1,000 other people as part of a New Year's Honors list, the Guardian reported. In addition to Sir Elton, Olivia Newton-John was among those affected by the unintentional reveal. Officials addressed the issue and apologized Saturday for accidentally leaking the information.
The data was dumped in a list that "recognizes the achievements and service of extraordinary people across the United Kingdom." But this may have been a little too much recognition.
The list with people's home addresses was available from about 10:30 p.m. Friday until early Saturday morning, the Guardian estimated. It included not only top counter-terrorism officials and celebrities, but Holocaust survivors, government employees and community and faith leaders. Some 1,097 names and addresses were erroneously published.
Previous prime minister Theresa May's cabinet made and approved the list, the newspaper reported. The government makes lists of people receiving various honors and knighthoods every year, once for New Year's Eve and once for the observance of Queen Elizabeth II's birthday in June.
