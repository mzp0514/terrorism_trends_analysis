To the Editor:
I am a longtime supporter of the Israeli ''Peace Now'' movement, which endorses the rights of the Palestinian people to national independence and sovereignty.
Most Palestinians, however, appear not to reciprocate these sentiments.
I am a longtime supporter of the Israeli ''Peace Now'' movement, which endorses the rights of the Palestinian people to national independence and sovereignty.While many Israelis and Jews throughout the world have attempted on numerous occasions to bring pressure to bear on the Government of Israel to change its hardline attitude toward the Palestinians, no Palestinian spokesmen of consequence have come forward to declare their willingness even to recognize the State of Israel.
Where are the Palestinian critics of P.L.O. terrorism, fanaticism and violence? Why do we not hear their call for moderation and sanity?
Peace, like war, requires more than one participant. Unless the leaders of the Palestinian nationalist movement openly accept Israel's right to exist, there will be no end to the death and misery that have plagued both the Israeli and Palestinian people for so long. Israeli voices of reason have been heard clearly and often.  It is time for their Palestinian counterparts similarly to speak out publicly in favor of an authentic peace.
