Syria has helped save American lives from terrorist attacks since Sept. 11 and strongly denies Israel's charge that it is part of an international axis that supports Palestinian terrorist acts, Syria's foreign minister said Friday.
Syria is on the U.S. list of countries that sponsor terrorism.
While Syrian minister Farouk al-Sharaa was presiding over the U.N. Security Council on Thursday, U.S. Ambassador John Negroponte accused Damascus of supporting terrorist groups and demanded that it condemn Palestinian suicide bombings, diplomats said.
At a news conference Friday, al-Sharaa was asked about a Knight Ridder report quoting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as saying his government provided intelligence to the United States three months ago about an al-Qaida operation that would have killed many American soldiers.
"I am not going to confirm anything related to security, but I confirm the substance of what is written in the press about that - that we have helped in rescuing American lives," al-Sharaa said, speaking in English.
"We have done that because this is a matter of principle," he said. "We are against terrorism, and at the same time the Americans know that we differentiate between terrorism, which we condemn, by al-Qaida, and the resistance, which we support, in the occupied (Palestinian) territories against (Israeli) occupation."
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State William Burns earlier told a House panel: "It is true that the cooperation the Syrians have provided, in their own self-interest, on al-Qaida, has saved American lives."
