The clash between federal law enforcement and Apple mirrors the divide in public opinion between the desire for security from terrorism and the fear of losing basic civil liberties.
While public opinion has fluctuated in the last 15 years -- often rising and falling depending on the immediacy of terrorist attacks -- the most recent poll findings have shown a close divide in the public's concern over terrorism versus privacy. 
  A CBS News poll conducted after the Paris terrorist attacks in late November found majorities of Americans regardless of their party affiliation are concerned about losing their privacy as a result of the federal government's efforts to combat terrorism. The survey found 54 percent of the public said they were very or somewhat concerned about the loss of privacy, while 44 percent were not very concerned or not at all concerned.
  Americans were asked in the same poll whether they were more concerned that the government would fail to enact strong antiterrorism laws or that the government would enact measures that would excessively restrict their civil liberties. By 46 percent to 40 percent, Americans said they were more apprehensive that the government would fail to enact strong antiterrorism laws.
  Republicans in the survey were more supportive of strong antiterrorism laws and less concerned about loss of civil liberties than Democrats were.
  There has not yet been polling on the specific issue of whether Apple should unlock the cellphone of a presumed terrorist, but Pew Research Center/GfK surveys conducted in 2014 and 2015 found that most Americans thought there were insufficient limits on the telephone and Internet data that the government collects.
  About nine in 10 Americans placed importance on maintaining personal privacy in a range of daily activities.
  It remains to be seen whether the public's opinion of Apple will be affected by the dispute, but several polls in recent years have found favorability ratings of the company are high (considerably higher than those for Congress or President Obama).
  A poll by Langer Research Associates for The Washington Post and ABC News in 2013, for example, found more than seven of 10 Americans expressed a favorable opinion of Apple.
