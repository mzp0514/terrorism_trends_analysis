(RTTNews) - A new Gallup poll released Wednesday shows a slight increase in Americans&apos; approval of how President Barack Obama has handled terrorism.
In the last latest poll, 49% approve how Obama has handled terrorism compared to the 45% who approved in a December poll.
The poll also showed that while 47% of Americans disapproved of Obama&apos;s handling of terrorism in December, 46% disapproved in the new poll.
His ratings on the economy, on the other hand, are still low, with only 40% approving of his handling of the economy compared to 56% disapproving.
Obama&apos;s numbers on health care reform are even worse, with 35% approving compared to 58% disapproving.
The president&apos;s numbers on foreign affairs were much better, splitting 47% to 47% between those who approve and those who disapprove of his foreign affairs policies.
As might have been expected, most Democrats approved of Obama&apos;s handling of these various issues, though a surprisingly low 64% of Democrats approved of his handling of health care reform.
Meanwhile, his numbers among independents were quite low, especially on the economy and health care reform, with only 31% approval on each of those two issues.
Obama&apos;s numbers among Republicans hit almost rock-bottom, with only 11% approving of his handling of health care reform.
