Saddam Hussein told aides he warned the United States before 1990 that terrorists would carry out a major strike on American soil, even raising the specter of a nuclear attack, according to secret tapes obtained by ABC News.
  A voice identified as Mr. Hussein's is heard on the recordings he was said to have made in his presidential office during the 1990's, ruling out any such strike by Iraq.
 The recordings also feature voices identified as those of members of his family talking about how to conceal data on illegal weapons programs from United Nations inspectors, according to ABC, which was to show the tapes late Wednesday.
  ''Terrorism is coming,'' the voice identified as Mr. Hussein's is heard to say. ''I told the Americans a long time before Aug. 2 and told the British as well and that in the future there will be terrorism with weapons of mass destruction.'' 
  The mention of ''Aug. 2'' on the tape, which ABC said was recorded in the mid-1990's, appears to be a reference to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, 1990.
  On the tapes, Mr. Hussein speculates that an attack with such weapons could be hard to stop.
  ''In the future, what would prevent a booby-trapped car causing a nuclear explosion in Washington, or a germ or a chemical one?'' he is quoted as saying, adding that Iraq would not contemplate such an act.
