U.S. and Canadian officials said Tuesday they had disrupted a major methamphetamine supply system through an investigation that netted 67 arrests and tons of illegal chemicals.
Many of the alleged brokers, money launderers and go-betweens were of Middle Eastern origin, including one New York man - grocery store owner Alaa Odeh - whose uncle recently was arrested in Israel's West Bank on charges of being a member of the Islamic Jihad terrorist group.
Much of the money was funneled to Amman, Jordan, and the West Bank cities of Nablus and Ramallah.
Assistant Attorney General Michael Chertoff, head of the Justice Department's criminal division, said the investigation would continue into the money trail.
The 18-month investigation centered on the shipment of pseudoephedrine - a common nasal decongestant that in large amounts is a key ingredient in methamphetamine - from three Canadian companies to large illicit labs in the Southwestern United States.
Among those charged are six current or former executives with three Canadian companies - Frega Inc., Formulex and GC Medical Products - who allegedly diverted thousands of pounds of pseudoephedrine to the U.S.
"Without a steady supply of pseudoephedrine, it's a lot harder to make methamphetamine," said Roger Guevara, a DEA official.
Authorities were hesitant to make any connection to terrorism, despite the use by alleged money launderers of the "hawallah" transfer schemes frequently favored by financiers of terror networks such as al-Qaida. These transfer schemes are run outside normal bank and financial channels, escaping government oversight.
