Down the bitter decades, Irish rebels have often turned to martyrdom by hunger, a double-edged weapon against Britain and themselves. Last week, as Robert Sands slid nearer death in Maze Prison, Irish willingness to die was again being matched against British will to rule.
Irish rebels, waiting for death of Robert Sands from hunger strike, lay in new supplies in preparation for more violence
As they waited, Northern Irish Roman Catholics and Protestants laid in supplies and prepared for new violence. Mr. Sands attracted international concern and visitors, including the Pope's Irish secretary and a British Labor Party spokesman for Northern Ireland, who failed to dissuade him. Owen Carron, manager of Mr. Sands' election to the British Parliament in March, found him ''in tremendous pain'' but ''prepared to die.'' His mother, Rosaleen, promised not to let doctors try to save him if he lost consciousness.
Again rejecting demands by Mr. Sands and three other Irish Republican Army hunger strikers to be treated as political prisoners (one, Francis Hughes, was also reported close to death), Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ''totally and utterly'' condemned all Ulster groups ''trying to impose their will by terrorism.''
Previous hunger strikes have sometimes failed, but in 1972, I.R.A.  strikers won ''special category'' status. After building new facilities -the ''H-blocks'' - at Maze Prison near Belfast, the Government abolished the category in 1976.
