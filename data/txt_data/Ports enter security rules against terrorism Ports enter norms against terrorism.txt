Rio, São Paulo, Curitiba and Florianópolis - Country certifies principal terminals. Security rules go into effect today at international ports and marine terminals as determined by the ISPS Code, which unites antiterrorism methods, instituted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) after the attacks of September 11, 2001 on the United States. 
Approved by 163 signatory countries, including Brazil, the ISPS Code was included in the SOLAS (Safeguareing Human Life at Sea) Convention of the IMO, in effect since 1974. Brazil has almost 180 international transport terminals, of which 162 already have presented security plans and - until yesterday - 105 port terminals had been inspected. The principal ones already were certified, among them being the Port of Santos, with Terminal 37 of Libra Terminais and the Tecon container terminal of Santos Brasil. Of the 105 terminals inspected by yesterday, 56 are approved for certification and 49 present bureaucratic hang-ups in their documentation. Of the 30 public ports with international cargo transit, five (Santos, Rio de Janeiro/Sepetiba, Paranaguá, Vitoria and Rio Grande), responsible for more than 70% of Brazil's foreign trade, will receive their certification today. By tomorrow, port installations responsible for 90% of the country's international trade will be certified.
