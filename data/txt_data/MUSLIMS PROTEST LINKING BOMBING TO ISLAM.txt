Hundreds of Muslims rallied outside a mosque yesterday to protest what they called false accusations of terrorism against Islam since the World Trade Center bombing.
Several leaders of the Islamic community from New Jersey and New York addressed the outdoor rally in a parking lot behind the mosque where Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman frequently preached.
The blind Egyptian cleric has been linked to some of the suspects arrested in the Feb. 26 bombing, but has denied any role in the attack that killed six people and injured more than 1,000 at the twin 110-story towers.
''Islam is not a religion of terrorism. It is the religion of peace,'' said Imam Amin Awad, leader of a Brooklyn-based mosque, where the sheik also has preached.
Speakers at the rally accused news media of distorting reports about Islam and the involvement in the bombing of people who prayed at the mosque.
''The media are not representing America,'' Awad said. ''It is representing some kind of special people in America and it is representing their special interests.''
Addressing the reporters present, Awad said: ''You are nothing but biased media. You are nothing but deceivers of American people.''
The crowd mounted several chants, including, ''Islam is peace. God is great. Islam is justice'' and ''Allah is the greatest. Islam is the latest.''
Some six busloads of people from New Jersey and New York participated in the rally.
