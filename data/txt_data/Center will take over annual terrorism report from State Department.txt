The State Department has decided to stop publishing an annual statistical account of terrorism incidents worldwide, turning the task over to a government center established last year by Congress.
"They are the people who do the detailed work," department spokesman Richard Boucher said in announcing that the National Counterterrorism Center would take on the job.
Last year, the department reported a decline in significant incidents of terrorism and then had to issue a corrected version showing an increase.
The falloff had been used by senior administration officials to bolster President George W. Bush's claim of success in countering terrorism.
Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., said at the time that the administration had "tried to take self-serving political credit" based on inaccurate information.
Colin Powell, then secretary of state, admitted that "the numbers were off." He said, "We have identified how we have to do this in the future."
Powell also said the initial report was not designed "to make our efforts look better or worse."
This year, the State Department again will, however, make public and provide to Congress by April 30 a country-by-country assessment of terrorism and will again list organizations it accuses of supporting terrorism.
"The people of the United States will get all the facts," Boucher said Monday. "The world will get all the facts."
Referring to last year's errant report, the spokesman said, "All of us found last year that the statistics, depending on how they are compiled, depending on the definitions used . . . can sometimes be misleading."
