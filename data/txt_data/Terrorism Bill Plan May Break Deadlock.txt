In a bid to salvage a stalled antiterrorism bill, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee has agreed to the demands of conservative Republicans to remove proposals expanding the Government's wiretapping authority.
President Clinton pushed the legislation as a response to the Oklahoma City bombing last April. A version passed the Senate in June, 91 to 8. But in the House, liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans have delayed the measure, saying they are concerned that it may erode civil liberties.
The leader of the Republican opponents, Representative Bob Barr of Georgia, said today that the proposed changes in the House bill had "significantly improved the chances for passage."
The changes include removal of the wiretap provisions, which Mr. Clinton had called essential in fighting terrorism, and of a provision allowing use of the military in emergencies involving chemical or biological weapons. Also cut was a definition of terrorism that included the use of firearms, which had angered Republican foes of gun control. The changes were listed in a letter from Mr. Barr and Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois, the Judiciary Committee chairman, sent to committee members on Thursday.
