Dec. 3--Crises and a community's response to them were the topics at the Coastal Georgia Meta-Leadership Summit for Preparedness Tuesday and Wednesday at the Sea Palms Resort on St. Simons Island.
Nearly 200 leaders from the public, private and non-profit sectors gathered at the resort to discuss preparedness for public health and safety crises, such an pandemic flu, terrorism, industrial accidents and natural disasters.
Glynn County representatives included staff members from the American Red Cross, the United Way, law enforcement, government and corporations, including Georgia Power and the Southeast Georgia Health System.
The summit was sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Foundation, the Harvard School of Public Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to encourage greater collaboration among government and the private sector during emergencies.
Leonard J. Marcus, co-director of the National Preparedness Leadership Initiative at the Harvard School of Public Health and considered a national expert on terrorism preparedness and emergency response, facilitated the program.
