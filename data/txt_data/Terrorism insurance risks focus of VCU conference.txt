The implications of the Terrorism Reinsurance Act -- under renewal consideration in Congress -- for the property casualty insurance industry will be the theme of the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Business' 2014 RISC Trends Conference.
Nationally known speakers will provide industry perspective at the conference, organized by the school's Risk & Insurance Studies Center, on Tuesday.
William Parrish, founder of VCU's Homeland Security Program and former senior executive in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, will present an overview of today's terrorism threat.
Jennifer Rubin, vice president of the Hiscox insurance company, will discuss coverage available in the market.
A panel featuring former Gov. Jim Gilmore and internationally known risk managers Shari Natovitz and Janice Ochenkowski will examine issues of dealing with the risks of terrorism.

The program also will include an ethics session.
Registration and a networking continental breakfast begin at 7:15 a.m. Lunch is included in the program.
