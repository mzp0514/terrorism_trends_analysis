Teachers union gives strike notice CHICAGO - The Chicago Teachers Union has given a 10-day strike notice, saying members are willing to walk off the job for the first time in 25 years. Union President Karen Lewis said Wednesday that contract talks are faltering, with unresolved issues that include pay increases and job security. The soonest teachers could go on strike is Sept. 
10. Many students are already back to school. The rest begin Tuesday. The Chicago Board of Education says it's ready to care for kids who rely on schools for meals and a safe place during the day. 2 arrested in fatal Galesburg shooting GALESBURG, Ill. - Police in Galesburg have arrested two men on first-degree murder charges in a fatal shooting this week. Authorities said Jereme Carter, 30, of Monmouth, and Barry Fletcher, 33, of Galesburg, face charges in the death of 38-year-old Terrell Allen. Allen was gunned down late Monday. New law: More prison for terror threats EDWARDSVILLE, Ill. - People convicted in Illinois of attempting to commit terrorism might have to serve more of any prison sentence they get under a law scheduled to take effect after this year. Gov. Pat Quinn this month signed into law a measure requiring that anyone convicted of such crimes serve 85 percent of their sentence. Under current state law, a prisoner can get one day of good-conduct credit for each day served behind bars. The measure was motivated by a Madison County case involving Olutosin Oduwole, a 27-year-old aspiring rapper convicted of attempting to threaten a Virginia Tech-like rampage and later sentenced last December to five years in prison. Oduwole might be eligible for parole after serving half of that.
