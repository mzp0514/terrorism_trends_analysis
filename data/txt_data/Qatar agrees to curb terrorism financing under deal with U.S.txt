Kuwait City The United States and Qatar signed a memo of understanding Tuesday on steps the tiny Persian Gulf nation will take to stop funding terrorism, U.S. officials said Tuesday. The agreement aims to encourage Qatar's neighbors to abandon their embargo on the country.
The memo was announced in the Qatar capital of Doha, where Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spent the day working to resolve a regional feud that the United States fears could derail efforts to fight groups like the Islamic State.
Tillerson flies Wednesday to the Saudi city of Jeddah to discuss the crisis with foreign ministers from the four Arab states leading the boycott: Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.
The Arab countries placed a trade and diplomatic embargo on Qatar a month ago, accusing it of providing financial support to terrorist groups. Qatar has rejected 13 broad demands from those nations, including closing the television network Al Jazeera, which criticizes many governments in the region. Qatar has denied the charges and considers the embargo an infringement on its sovereignty and independence.
Though President Donald Trump has sided with Saudi Arabia, Tillerson told reporters in Doha that Qatar's views were "reasonable" and that he is optimistic the differences can be reconciled.
"I am hopeful we can make some progress to begin to bring this to a point of resolution," Tillerson said, standing beside Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani on Tuesday.
