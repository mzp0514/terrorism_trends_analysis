U.S. attorney stresses that those questioned are not suspects
 Three North Dakota men are being questioned for possible information about September's terrorist assaults, or future attacks on the United States, U.S. Attorney Drew Wrigley said.
 The men are Middle Eastern and are not U.S. citizens.
The state Bureau of Criminal Investigation has already questioned one, and has scheduled an interview with a second man next week, Wrigley said Thursday.
 No one is in custody, and the men may refuse to cooperate if they choose, Wrigley said. He compared the situation to a neighborhood canvass after a crime has been committed in the area.
 'They are not suspects, and they're not being treated as such,' he said. 'These are folks who the Justice Department feels just might have some information â€¦ Sometimes things just fit into an investigation, and people have information that they don't even know is helpful.'
 Authorities had identified another three men for questioning in North Dakota, but they have since moved out of state, the prosecutor said.
 Wrigley declined to identify the men, or give any description of the area of North Dakota in which they live.
 'These folks have their privacy,' he said. 'They're not suspects, or anything of that nature.'
