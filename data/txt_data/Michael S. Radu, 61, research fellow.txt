Michael S. Radu, 61, of Broomall, a senior fellow since 1982 at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia, died of cardiovascular disease on March 25 at home. 
In 2002, he was founding co-chairman of the institute's Center on Terrorism, Counter-Terrorism and Homeland Security.
His books ranged from Eastern Europe and the Third World, published by Praeger in 1981, to Islam in Europe, published this year by Mason Crest of Broomall for students in grades K-12.
Born in Romania, Mr. Radu earned master's degrees in philosophy and art history and, in 1975, a doctorate in medieval West European history, all from Babes-Bolyai University in Cluj, Romania.
Mr. Radu earned a doctorate in political science and international relations from Columbia University in 1981 and was a National Peace Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University in 1984-85.
He was a United Nations monitor in the 1993 general elections in Cambodia, and a monitor for private U.S. entities during the presidential and congressional elections in Guatemala in 1985 and in Peru and Romania, both in 1990.
His scholarly work also took him far afield.
In 2007, he was a lecturer at the Universidad Sergio Arboleda in Bogota, Colombia, on counterterrorism and counterinsurgency.
In 2005, the State Department sponsored his speeches in Seoul, Athens, and Thessaloniki.
In 1986, he was a visiting professor in the department of international relations at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa.
Since 1986, he had been on the editorial board of the Institute for Strategic Studies at the University of Pretoria.
He had been a visiting professor at Chestnut Hill College, Immaculata College, and Rutgers and St. Joseph Universities and was a lecturer at Temple University and the University of Pennsylvania.
Last year, he was a visiting scholar in Central and East European studies at LaSalle University.
Before arriving in the States, he was curator of the West European art collection at the Brukenthal Museum in Sibiu, Romania from 1970 to 1975.
While at the Foreign Police Research Institute in Philadelphia, he co-founded and edited the Romanian-language Agora, a quarterly journal of contributions from exiles and dissidents that was published from 1987 to 1991.
Mr. Radu is survived by his wife, Patricia Vargas-Radu; and his mother, Anna.
Services were March 30.
