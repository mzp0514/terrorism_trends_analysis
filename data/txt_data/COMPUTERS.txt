Americans feel the effort to prevent computer problems and terrorism around the new year was responsible for the lack of disruption, a CBS News poll has found.
Sixty-three percent of respondents said the lack of Y2K problems was because of the time and money spent correcting computer systems.
Only 32 percent said the issue wasn't serious.
Americans also credited the government for preventing terrorism. Around 60 percent thought the time and energy spent boosting security prevented an attack, not that the possibility of terrorism wasn't real.
The CBS poll of 707 adults was conducted by telephone last Sunday. It has a margin of error of four percentage points. SECURITY
RealNetworks has sued to stop consumers' suits that claim the maker of software for playing online music and video violated privacy laws.
The suit claims any disputes should be settled through arbitration, according to a licensing agreement between RealNetworks and its customers. Consumers must accept the agreement's terms before installing any RealNetworks products.
Several lawsuits have been filed against RealNetworks by customers who claim the company had tapped into computer hard drives each time users access its software programs. The RealJukebox program secretly transmitted information about what songs compact disc users were playing and downloading. GATEWAYVA.COM
