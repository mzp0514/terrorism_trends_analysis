RIVERTON - A 41-year-old Herriman man was arrested Aug. 21 after police say his threats prompted a hospital to go into lockdown.
The man had called Riverton Hospital to get information about his adult daughter who had been admitted to the emergency room, according to a police affidavit. When hospital staff members told the man they were unable to provide information, he began to make threats.
"(He) told the hospital staff and phone operators that he was going to come to the hospital and shoot everybody and stated his intent to detonate an explosive device at the hospital. (He) made these threats several times during nearly 25 phone calls to the hospital," according to a police affidavit.
The threats caused the hospital to activate security lockdown procedures, the affidavit states. The man also threatened to harm police if they came to his home, according to the affidavit.
Police did go to the man's Herriman home, where after several phone calls the man came out of his house and was arrested for investigation of making a threat of terrorism and booked into the Salt Lake County Jail.
The arresting officer noted in his affidavit that the man "showed no remorse and even tried to convince me that his action regarding the threats were warranted because the hospital would not provide him the information he was seeking."
