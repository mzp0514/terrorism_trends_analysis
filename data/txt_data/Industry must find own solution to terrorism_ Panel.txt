MONTE CARLO, Monaco-The next major terrorist attack is a question of when, not if, and the insurance industry must find a solution to the problem, panelists at the recent Rendez-Vous de Septembre reinsurance gathering agreed.
``Terrorism is perhaps the biggest threat today to peace in our world and our industry,'' said Ron Pressman, chairman and chief executive officer of GE Insurance Solutions in Kansas City, Mo., who moderated the panel discussion.
``We're here to protect people, property and communities and help rebuild after catastrophes. Now it's time for our industry to stand tall and fulfill our mission to help recovery efforts in the Gulf Coast,'' Mr. Pressman said, adding that terrorism remains a significant risk. ``If anything, it's almost a certainty that further attacks...lie in store for people around the world.''
Joe Plumeri, chairman and CEO of London-based Willis Group Holdings Ltd., said ``the global insurance brokers have a key role to play in the industry's response to terrorism risks.... But if elements of hurricanes are unpredictable, terrorism is even more difficult to chart.''
He said ``the question of the next terrorist attack is not if,'' and this situation requires a comprehensive, systemic solution.
The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act was an important step following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but the industry needs to find a permanent solution to the problem of terrorism, Mr. Plumeri said.
``Action, reaction, fade from memory'' is the sequence that has resulted since 9/11 and other catastrophes, he said. ``There is no permanency to (solving) an issue that's permanent. A solution must be found,'' Mr. Plumeri said.
Congress is considering legislation that would reauthorize TRIA beyond its Dec. 31, 2005, sunset, but observers do not consider approval to be assured.
``The uncertainty of TRIA's future'' has led underwriters to be uncertain on whether to include terrorism in policies renewing Jan. 1, 2006, Mr. Plumeri noted. ``The government and the insurance industry need to come together and develop a mechanism'' to solve the problem. ``Not acting puts us all at extraordinary risk,'' he said.
Outlining developments in international terrorism, a leading researcher painted a frightening picture of what lies ahead. Rohan Gunaratna of Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, said several significant developments have occurred in the past four years.
One is ``a shift of international terrorism from Afghanistan to Iraq. The epicenter of global terrorism is in Iraq, with links to 30 other countries,'' said Mr. Gunaratna, who is head of the International Centre for Political Violence & Terrorism Research at the university's Institute of Defence & Strategic Studies. ``The threat of terrorism from Iraq will affect Europe,'' he said.
A second development is that ``Al Qaeda as an organization has atomized, so the threat has been dispersed through Asia, Africa and Europe,'' Mr. Gunaratna said. ``After 9/11, every three months we are seeing a significant attack'' somewhere in the world. ``In many ways, Al Qaeda's achievement has been to infect local jihad groups that had local agendas. They are now seeking to target the United States and its friends,'' he said.
The third development is that terrorist groups ``in the past spoke of chemical and biological weapons, but today they are experimenting with them, making very significant investments in this area,'' Mr. Gunaratna said. Evidence turned up in Afghanistan and Pakistan, for example, showed that Al Qaeda had tested chemical agents on dogs, he said.
Mr. Gunaratna suggested that while European and North American security forces have disrupted more than 100 potential attacks, an ongoing effort is needed. Security forces must conduct operational counterterrorism, in which ``they identify cells planning attacks and disrupt them,'' as well as strategic counterterrorism, which strikes at the root causes of terrorist activity, he said.
``For every terrorist arrested, another has been born. Nations need to invest more in education and ideological response and work together in partnership with Muslim communities,'' Mr. Gunaratna said. ``America made a fatal mistake going into Iraq, but an even bigger mistake is to withdraw. It's our war now,'' he said.
``Less than 1% of Muslims support terrorism. We must be proportional in our response,'' Mr. Gunaratna said. ``Terrorists are spawned in conflict zones,'' where there is suffering and internal displacement, and these are areas that nations must address, he said.
Stephen Patrick Cain, a former British Army officer and counterterrorism expert who is a member of the board of advisers of the World Institute for Security Enhancement, suggested there may be an economic solution long-term.
``No terror movement, national or transnational, has ever been defeated by military arms,'' Mr. Cain said. ``Military arms per se and alone are useless in putting down terrorism. Security forces are merely Band-Aids on a hemorrhage.''
He used the example of the Irish Republican Army, which fought British troops for 35 years. A relative handful-about 200 principals-held down more than 15,000 trained troops during that time, Mr. Cain said. And the number of Islamic terrorists worldwide is far greater, he noted.
``I keep hearing the phrase, `9/11 changed everything,' but have we really changed?'' Mr. Cain asked. ``We must really know our enemies before we can defeat them, and in so doing we must know who is not our enemy.''
As the Allies did with the Japanese and the Germans after World War II, ``we must begin to trade in the Muslim world'' and engage them as trading partners, Mr. Cain said. ``Education on both sides of the divide is an effective tool.''
