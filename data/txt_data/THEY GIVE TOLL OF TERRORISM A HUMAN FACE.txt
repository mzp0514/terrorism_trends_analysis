VERED YARIMI is afraid to be alone - but she doesn't want other victims of terrorism to be.
Yarimi, 20, was shot twice in each leg during a terrorist attack in Israel four years ago. 
The bullet-blazing assault killed four women and sent Yarimi, then a student, to the hospital for six months of rehabilitation and eight surgeries.
"I live my nightmares and fears every day," said Yarimi, who traveled to New York with 16 members of One Family, an Israeli support group.
"My hope is that people find some way to reach out and help people in other situations, not just Israel."
One Family is hoping to put a human face on the toll of terrorism around the world.
"We have people who have the attitude [that] it's not happening to me, it's not my problem," said Sarri Singer, a spokeswoman for the group.
"We want New Yorkers to take action," she added. Another visitor, Rachel Dahan, is slowly putting her life back together after a suicide bomber killed her brother, Tzion, during an attack last year in Ashdod Port, Israel.
"We want people to understand our story," said Dahan, 38. "There are two sides to the story. We have to manage our lives with each other [the Palestinians]. Otherwise, there will be war forever."
