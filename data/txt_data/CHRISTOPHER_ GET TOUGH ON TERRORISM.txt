GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) Declaring "Gaza cannot be a safe haven," Secretary of State Warren Christopher today urged PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat to take tougher action against terrorists.
"There are important steps that can be taken," Christopher said, even while acknowledging the Israelis understand that "no one can assure 100 percent success" in averting terrorist attacks.
Arafat pledged his cooperation, but added, "I have no magic stick. We are doing all our best."
During an hour-long meeting, Christopher reported on his efforts to persuade other governments to fulfill their pledges to contribute tens of millions of dollars and to outline new U.S. aid to the fledgling Palestinian Authority.
The aid includes 200 surplus trucks and the dispatch of teams from the Pentagon and the Agriculture Department for advice on medical, humanitarian and agricultural needs.
Before the meeting, Christopher praised Israel and the PLO for setting a July 1 target date for finalizing an agreement to withdraw Israeli troops from the West Bank and hold Palestinian elections.
He received a detailed report about the agreement from Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and said it injects "a new burst of energy" into the peace process.
"There is a sense of revitalization across the entire peace process," Christopher said outside Peres' office in Jerusalem.
Peres briefly admonished reporters for a tendency toward skepticism about the agreement he concluded Thursday with Arafat being implemented smoothly.
