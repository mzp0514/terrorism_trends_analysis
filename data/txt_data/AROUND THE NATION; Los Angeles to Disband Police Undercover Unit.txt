The City Police Commission voted unanimously today to disband the Los Angeles Police Department's Public Disorder Intelligence Division, an undercover unit that is under investigation for spying on city officials and lawful civic organizations.
The commission ordered the division ''deactivated'' within 45 days but stressed that it wanted the department to continue efforts to monitor and suppress political terrorism.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 18 - The City Police Commission voted unanimously today to disband the Los Angeles Police Department's Public Disorder Intelligence Division, an undercover unit that is under investigation for spying on city officials and lawful civic organizations.
The Public Disorder Intelligence Division was nominally established to deal with terrorism, but evidence presented recently in court litigation indicated that the unit had infiltrated peaceful civic organizationa and that it maintained intelligence files on citizens that it had been ordered to destroy.
Daryl F. Gates, the Police Chief, who had vigorously supported operations of the division, said after the commission's decision that he would establish a transition committee to assure that the division's antiterrorism program continued.
