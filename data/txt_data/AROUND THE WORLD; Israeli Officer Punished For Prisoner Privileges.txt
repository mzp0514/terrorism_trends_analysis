Israeli Border Police Chief Inspector Meir Levi is demoted to inspector, fined 15 days' pay and reprimanded after disciplinary trial on charges of giving special privileges to Jews accused of terrorism who are on trial in Jerusalem's District Court; Levi reportedly took prisoners to beach and for meal at border police canteen at Ben-Gurion International Airport (S)
The trial was ordered earlier today by the Inspector General of Police, Commissioner Avraham Kraus, after he received a report saying the officer, who was responsible for taking the men from court to prison, had made a detour Thursday to a beach to let the men swim. One of the prisoners was saved from drowning.
A preliminary investigation was said to have confirmed that incident and another two days earlier in which the Chief Inspector took the prisoners to Ben-Gurion International Airport for a meal in the border police canteen.
