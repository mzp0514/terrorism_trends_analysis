More than 2 million Muslim pilgrims made the climactic ascent Monday to Mount Arafat, Islam's most sacred site, to pray for salvation, and Saudi Arabia's top cleric urged Islamic unity in the face of what he called the West's war on Islam.
After offering prayers on the mount, tens of thousands rushed down the hill to the Muzdalifah, a few miles away, where they collected pebbles to use in one of the hajj's last rituals, the stoning of the devil.
Under a religious edict issued two years ago, the stoning now may begin before dawn prayers today. The decree was an attempt to ease crowding at the stoning site, where hundreds have died in stampedes over the past quarter-century. 
Speaking at a mosque on the plain of Mount Arafat, Sheik Abdul-Aziz al-Sheik, the kingdom's grand mufti, said Muslims were facing critical challenges, among them accusations of terrorism and human rights abuses and calls for revisions in school textbooks.
"Oh, Muslim nation, there is a war against our creed, against our culture under the pretext of fighting terrorism. We should stand firm and united in protecting our religion," he said.
"Islam's enemies want to empty our religion of its contents and its meaning," al-Sheik said. "But the soldiers of God will be victorious."
The faithful called out: "Amen."
