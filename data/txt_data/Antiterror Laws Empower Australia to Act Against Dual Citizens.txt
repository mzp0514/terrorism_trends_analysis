SYDNEY, Australia -- Australia passed new laws on Thursday giving the government power to revoke the Australian citizenship of some people with dual nationality if it suspects they may be engaging in terrorism, even if the people have not been charged with any crime.
Critics say the laws are unconstitutional, and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has acknowledged that they will probably be challenged in Australia's highest court. 
  The laws are intended to prevent Australians with dual citizenship who go abroad to join, support or train with extremist groups like the Islamic State from returning to the country. About 90 Australians are believed to be fighting alongside extremists in Iraq and Syria now, according to Australian intelligence agencies, and about 30 more have done so and then returned.
  The laws were proposed in February by Tony Abbott, who was prime minister at the time. They were drafted in the aftermath of a siege in a cafe in central Sydney in December 2014 in which two hostages and a gunman were killed. Government officials argue that the cafe siege and a handful of other recent violent episodes show that people who express jihadist sentiments pose a serious threat to Australia.
  ''Terrorism is not going to diminish in our lifetimes,'' Peter Dutton, the immigration minister, said last month in Parliament. ''Governments need to be prepared to deal with that.''
  The new laws can be applied to Australians overseas who help raise money or recruit and train new members for extremist groups, as well as those who engage in violence directly.
  The Immigration Ministry would decide whose citizenship to revoke, based on advice from intelligence agencies. It is already preventing people from flying out of Australia if the government suspects they are on their way to join extremists in Iraq or Syria, Mr. Dutton told Parliament, giving a figure of 199 people who had been stopped since July.
  Critics say it is unconstitutional to allow the government to revoke citizenship without judicial review.
  ''A person should only lose their citizenship if they have been convicted by a court of law of a relevant offense, such as an act of terrorism directed at Australians,'' said Fiona McLeod, president of the Australian Bar Association.
  Mr. Dutton argued in Parliament last month that the people covered by the law ''have in essence renounced their own citizenship'' by engaging in terrorism.
  The bills, which had already passed the lower house of Parliament, became law on Thursday with a final reading in the Senate. The governing Liberal Party and the main opposition bloc, the Labor Party, both supported the bill; the smaller Greens Party opposed it.
  ''We cannot make Australians safer by making other countries less safe,'' said Nick McKim, a Greens Party member from Tasmania. ''The best place for violent extremists is in secure Australian prisons.''
  Mr. McKim said the laws would simply allow suspected terrorists to keep operating overseas and, potentially, commit more violent acts.
  Some critics said that the laws treat Australians very differently based solely on whether they are inside or outside the country. ''It seems morally arbitrary that one person, living in Australia and with no other nationality, could be sent to jail in Australia, while another person with dual citizenship could be stripped of their Australian citizenship,'' said Rayner Thwaites, a lecturer at Sydney University's law school.
  An earlier version of the legislation would have applied equally to dual citizens inside or outside Australia, but that and other provisions were changed after strong criticism from constitutional and human rights lawyers.
  Sangeetha Pillai, a lecturer in law at Monash University in Melbourne, said the revisions made it likelier, but still not certain, that the law would survive a High Court challenge. ''It is not clear that the Australian government has unrestricted power to take away the citizenship of Australian citizens,'' she said.
  Letta Tayler, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, said that Austria, Belgium and Britain have all changed their laws to allow the revocation of citizenship in certain circumstances related to terrorism. France is also considering a move to strip French-born dual citizens of their French citizenship, she said, which would require a change to the country's Constitution.
  ''The Belgium law has caused concern because it applies only to foreign-born nationals, essentially creating a two-tiered system of citizenship,'' Ms. Tayler said. ''In the U.K., laws enacted in 2014 and 2015 combine to strip British citizenship from naturalized citizens even if it may lead to statelessness -- a clear violation of international law.''
