(RTTNews) - India and Spain Monday set up a joint anti-terror mechanism, which includes establishing a working group of experts from both countries and providing support to victims of terrorism, media reports said.
The experts from either country would be based in New Delhi and Madrid. The other measures in the anti-terror mechanism include exchange of counter-terrorism experts by both countries.
Expressing Spain&apos;s condolences for the victims of the Mumbai terror attacks, Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega offered her country&apos;s help in containing such strikes.
"Spain has considerable expertise in handling terror. We would help India in numerous fields like policies of border surveillance which we have developed," she said at a press conference in New Delhi.
She was speaking after a meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh where the two leaders also discussed the global economic meltdown.
"We also discussed India&apos;s modernization plans and the fact that a large number of Spanish companies are interested in investing in them," she said.
Fernandez also handed over a formal invitation from the Spanish monarch for the visit of President Pratibha Patil to that country that is likely to take place at the end of April.
