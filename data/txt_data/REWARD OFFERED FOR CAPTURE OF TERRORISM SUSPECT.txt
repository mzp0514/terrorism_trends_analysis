MONTREAL (AP) The U.S. embassy has offered a reward of up to $ 5 million for help in capturing an Algerian suspected of planning a terrorist attack in the United States.
Abdelmajid Dahoumane, 33, disappeared in December at the same time that another Algerian, Ahmed Ressam, was arrested while trying to enter the United States in a car with bomb-making supplies in the trunk.
Police say Ressam and Dahoumane shared a Vancouver, B.C., motel room for three weeks prior to Ressam's arrest in Port Angeles and that traces of explosives were found in the room.
Dahoumane has been charged in the United States and Canada with illegal possession of explosives with the intent to cause damage.
"Mr. Dahoumane is considered to be a potentially dangerous terrorist and is still at large," said Jack Hurley, head of security at the U.S. embassy in Ottawa.
Speaking at a joint news conference Thursday with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Hurley said that "anyone with information on his location is encouraged to contact the FBI or the diplomatic security service immediately."
Hurley said the U.S. government would offer to relocate to the United States anyone who helped in the capture of Dahoumane.
Dahoumane was last seen in Montreal in December, Canadian law enforcement officials said.
