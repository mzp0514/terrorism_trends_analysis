WASHINGTON (AP) - Two banks and Anheuser-Busch Inc. paid pen alties for violating the U.S. economic embargo of Libya, the Treasury Department said Monday.  Bank of New York paid a civil penalty of $225,000 to settle 174 violations, including fund transfers to Libya, the department's Office of Foreign Asset Control said.
The New York office of a French bank, Credit Lyonnaise, paid $92,400. The St.  Louis brewery giant Anheuser-Busch paid a penalty of $25,000 for three attempts to export beer through Malta to offshore Libyan-owned oil rigs.  ''These penalties should serve notice on the U.S. business community that anyone who transacts business with the government of Libya will pay a penalty for violating sanctions. Libya should be synonymous with 'too hot to handle,' '' said the office's director, R. Richard Newcomb.  In a statement, the office said Bank of New York paid a reduced penalty ''because of the high level of cooperation it demonstrated in voluntarily disclosing the extent of the violations, and in taking steps to ensure compliance in the future.'' Libya has been under U.S. economic sanctions since 1986. The sanctions are aimed at hindering its ability to finance and promote terrorism, the office said.
