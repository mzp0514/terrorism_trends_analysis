(RTTNews) - Nigeria has raised special anti-terror squads, and approved the deployment of special air marshals on U.S.-bound flights after the Christmas Day attempt by a Nigerian al-Qaida suspect to blow up an American commercial flight from Amsterdam to Detroit, using explosives strapped to his underwear and smuggled aboard.
Vice President Jonathan Goodluck told a visiting American delegation, led by Deputy Secretary for Homeland Security, Jane Holl Lute, his country had stepped up security measures at its airports by ordering for ten 3-D body scanners.
He noted that two of these, earlier purchased by the Central Bank, were put at the disposal of the Ministry of Aviation, for use at the Lagos and Abuja international airports.
Goodluck also said his country had ratified nine of the about 16 international anti-terrorism legislations, adding that even before the Christmas Day incident, his country proposed an anti-terrorism bill, now awaiting adoption by the National Assembly.
He also urged the U.S. delegation to de-list Nigeria from the group of 14 nations as a "country-of-interest" whose citizens were being subjected to additional screening measures if they were to travel by air to American destinations.
