It's heartening to see a growing discussion of the lack of attention that's been paid in recent days to the latest atrocities committed in Nigeria by what The Times recently described and mapped as "           Boko Haram, the other Islamic State."
Incidents in recent days have included deadly attacks involving young           girls strapped with bombs. On a grander scale, there has been a massacre in the long-suffering town of Baga,            on Lake Chad's shore, although initial reports of            more than 2,000 slaughtered by hundreds of Boko Haram militants are being challenged by the Nigerian military, which says the toll is            more like 150. The truth will out, of course, as was the case in a military assault on the town in 2013. (           Satellite imagery helped clarify what happened, as did            Human Rights Watch.)
In the meantime, Max Fisher at Vox has posted a helpful overview, noting that "the story of the Baga massacre is a story of Boko Haram's depravity but also of the Nigerian military's abject failure."
It would be easy to miss the Nigerian developments behind the saturation coverage of the murderous attacks on the Charlie Hebdo office and other targets in France, and the            subsequent outpouring of support for the victims.
Why did the world ignore Boko Haram's Baga attacks? http://t.co/w5krsFHATW #IamNigeria We intervene all over but not in Nigeria. Why not?

African journalists, among others, are trying to widen the focus. On the South African website Daily Maverick, Simon Allison wrote a tough piece aptly titled, "I am Charlie, but I am Baga too: On Nigeria's forgotten massacre."
But it's also true that a simple comparison of coverage can miss underlying conditions that make terrorism so perversely normal in one place and exceptional elsewhere, as Matt Schiavenza noted on The Atlantic website yesterday: 
The main difference between France and Nigeria isn't that the public and the media care about one and not the other. It is, rather, that one country has an effective government and the other does not. The French may not be too fond of President Francois Hollande-his approval ratings last November had plunged to 12 percent-but he responded to his country's twin terror attacks with decisiveness. Not so Nigeria's Goodluck Jonathan. Since assuming the presidency in 2010, Jonathan has done little to contain Boko Haram. The group emerged in 2002 and has consolidated control over an area larger than West Virginia. And it's gaining ground. Perversely, the seemingly routine nature of Nigeria's violence            may have diminished the perception of its newsworthiness.
Tipping the balance in Nigeria toward more effective governance is vital if promising trajectories on girl's education (           despite Boko Haram's efforts) and            agricultural productivity are to be sustained.
 Update, 5:40 p.m. | It's important to note that events in France are still unfolding, including a search for up to six accomplices in the Paris attacks.
