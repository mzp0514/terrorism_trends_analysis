The FBI said Monday it had no information to indicate that the three Texas men arrested with about 1,000 cell phones in their van had any direct connection to known terrorist groups.
Also, a prosecutor in a separate Ohio case said he was unable to prove a terrorism link between two men arrested after buying large numbers of cell phones. The prosecutor said he would drop terrorism charges.
In the Michigan case, authorities had increased patrols on the five-mile Mackinac Bridge after local prosecutors said investigators believed the men were targeting the span. But the FBI issued a news release Monday saying there is no imminent threat to the bridge, which links Michigan's upper and lower peninsulas.
The three are Adham Abdelhamid Othman, 21, of Dallas, and Maruan Awad Muhareb, 18, and Louai Abdelhamied Othman, 23, both of Mesquite, Texas. They were stopped by police Friday outside a Wal-Mart store in Caro, about 80 miles north of Detroit. Store employees had become suspicious when they purchased about 80 cell phones.
In Ohio, prosecutor James Schneider said he lacked enough evidence to present a grand jury with felony terrorism charges naming Ali Houssaiky and Osama Abulhassan, both of Dearborn, Mich.
Abulhassan and Houssaiky admitted buying about 600 phones in recent months at stores in southeast Ohio and selling them to someone in Dearborn.
