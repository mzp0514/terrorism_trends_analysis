As a day of horrors unfolded this morning, some Atlantans in New York were eyewitnesses to the worst day of terrorism in history. The carnage began when a pair of planes flew into the World Trade Center in Manhattan.

Jim Wallace, an Atlanta man in New York on a business trip today, said he watched people jump from the 110-story structure.
"There's probably been about 10 or 12 people jump out of the window, obviously trying to avoid burning to death and they are jumping to their death," said Wallace, who watched from his hotel room at the Hilton Millennium across the street from the World Trade Center
"It's unbelievable," Wallace told WSB Radio today.
Wallace, who was watching from the 16th floor of the hotel, described the scene down on the street below: "People obviously are panicked. There's debris everywhere --- papers, office supplies."
Former Marietta resident Kirsten Anderson, now living in New York, said, "I saw this big silver flash, and then a loud boom."
Anderson said she left her office eight blocks from the World Trade Center when she heard on the radio of the first plane hit. She was headed on foot toward the building out of curiosity and was four blocks away on Wall Street when the second plane hit.
"I knew it had to be an airplane, but it had gone by too fast for me to really see," she said.
Anderson, a student at New York University, was near the scene during the bombing at Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta and knew to get close to the edge of the sidewalk to avoid what she knew would be oncoming crowds.
