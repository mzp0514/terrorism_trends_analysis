"We will support the Philippines in their fight," said Utah Senator Bob Bennett during his visit to Brigham Young University on Jan. 8.
U.S. News and World Report also reports that Abu Sayyaf has ties to the al Qaida terrorist network.

"There are a lot of anti-Americans over there. They think Americans are intruding," said Michelle Jurquina, a Provo resident who grew up in the Philippines.
