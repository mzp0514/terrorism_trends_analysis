Franklin D. Roosevelt warned us long ago that in politics nothing "just happens," everything "is planned." Caroline Glick in the Jerusalem Post wrote: "Under Mubarak, Egypt advanced U.S. interests in two ways. 
First, by waging war against the Muslim Brotherhood and opposing the rise of Iranian power in the region. Mubarak weakened regional forces that most threatened U.S. interests. "Second, by managing the Suez Canal in conformance with international maritime law, Egypt facilitated the smooth transport of petroleum products to global markets and prevented Iran from operating in the Mediterranean Sea." So, why should an American president want to take Mubarak out? In a speech on the war on terrorism in 2005, President Bush likened the ideology of Islamic militants to communism, saying that they were attempting to overthrow all moderate governments in the region and establish a radical Islamic empire. So now the media wants us to believe that all three leaders, in Egypt, Libya and Syria, just decided to start beating up their citizens? Back in 2005, we already knew the radical Islamists were planning to overthrow these governments. With Obama's encouragement, their attempt succeeded. A report stated that in July 1932 young university students voted disproportionately for Hitler. Our media has informed us, the young flocked to Obama, like mice following the Pied Piper. If we don't wake up to who Obama really is, the price of ignorance may be higher than we want to pay.
