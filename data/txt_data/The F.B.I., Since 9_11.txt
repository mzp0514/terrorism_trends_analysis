To the Editor:
  Nothing could be further off the mark than to say the Federal Bureau of Investigation ''has remained firmly oriented toward traditional law enforcement, even since the attacks of Sept. 11'' (front page, June 30).
At no time in our history has the F.B.I. changed on such a large scale as in the last three and a half years -- with virtually all of it directed toward strengthening our counterterrorism capabilities. 
  We've redirected nearly 2,000 additional agents to fight terrorism and built a first-rate intelligence program supported by agents, analysts and linguists who work closely with their intelligence and law enforcement community partners to collect, analyze, share and act on valuable information.
  We've changed our approach to combating terrorism from prosecution to prevention, by using intelligence sources and methods to identify, penetrate and neutralize terrorist organizations and operations. 
  Because terrorists are often involved in criminal activity, the F.B.I.'s ability to integrate intelligence and law enforcement is one of the most powerful tools in the war on terror. 
  The creation of a National Security Service in the F.B.I. is the next step in the development of our national security capabilities and will integrate the F.B.I. more effectively into the intelligence community. 
  It is a disservice to the 30,000 F.B.I. employees who have embraced change to suggest that they are wedded to the past.
