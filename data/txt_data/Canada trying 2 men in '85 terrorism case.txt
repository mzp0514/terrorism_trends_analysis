VANCOUVER -- The worst case of terrorism in Canadian history is finally coming to trial.
Almost 18 years after the destruction of Air India Flight 182, two men will face a British Columbia Supreme Court judge, sitting without a jury, in criminal trial more complex, more expensive than the Canadian justice system has ever before heard.
It all began on June 23, 1985.
That's the day a suitcase bomb exploded aboard Air India Flight 182, plunging the aircraft into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Ireland.
All 329 crew and passengers -- including 125 children -- perished. Most of them were Canadians of Indian descent and many of the bodies would never be recovered.
Less than an hour earlier, another bomb blast killed two baggage handlers at Tokyo's Narita airport. Luggage containing a stereo tuner hiding an explosive device was meant to be placed aboard Air India Flight 301.
It was the world's deadliest case of aviation terrorism until the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.
Ajaib Singh Bagri, a 53-year-old sawmill worker from Kamloops, British Columbia, and Ripudaman Singh Malik, a 56-year-old Vancouver millionaire, face multiple counts, including first-degree murder, attempted murder and conspiracy in the bombings.
