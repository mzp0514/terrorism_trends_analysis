The Central Intelligence Agency has decided to stop publishing analyses for consumption by the general public because they take too much time to prepare and draw too much attention to the agency, a spokesman said Tuesday.
Among the analyses to be dropped are widely read studies of international terrorism and estimates of future Soviet oil production.
CIA ceases publication of analyses for consumption by general public, including studies of international terrorism and Soviet oil production
Dale Peterson, a spokesman for the agency, said the decision, which does not apply to publication of unclassified statistical data, stemmed from a review ordered by William J. Casey, Director of Central Intelligence.
The analytical reports began appearing in the late 1960's and accelerated under Mr. Casey's predecessor, Adm. Stansfield Turner.  Mr. Peterson said all of them were derived from classified reports for Government officials.
''It took manpower to start with a classified report and try to produce something meaningful in an unclassified fashion,'' Mr.  Peterson said, adding that a secondary reason for the decision was Mr. Casey's view that ''an intelligence agency should maintain a low profile.''
The spokesman said the statistical reports would continue because they were easier to produce in unclassified versions.
