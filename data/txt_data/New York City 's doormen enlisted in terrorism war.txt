Authorities in this city of apartment buildings have turned to a new ally in the war on terror: doormen.
Antiterrorism training began last week for 28,000 doormen, superintendents and porters in 3,500 apartment buildings.
Under a program developed by the Service Employees International Union, landlord groups, the Police Department, and other emergency agencies, the workers will receive four hours of classroom training on how to spot and respond to potential terrorism threats.
The course is taught by off-duty police academy instructors.
The workers are warned to be on the lookout for cars or trucks that are parked near buildings for a long time, or that have no license plates; for anyone who takes pictures of the building or lingers too long outside; and for new tenants who move in with little or no furniture.
The doormen are also taught to view as suspicious any packages with no return address or too much postage.
"The police and the building service workers are natural allies," said Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly. "Both work around the clock; both are in the business of protecting people. This program gives us a powerful network of eyes and ears on the street."
The doormen will also be taught how to respond to bomb threats and how to identify and contain biological and chemical agents.
In addition, there are lessons on how to recognize fraudulent IDs and documents.
"We have so many people and deliveries coming in and out of here - in today's world, that's risky," said John Orozco, a superintendent in a 17-story building on the Upper West Side. "We have to know what to look for."
