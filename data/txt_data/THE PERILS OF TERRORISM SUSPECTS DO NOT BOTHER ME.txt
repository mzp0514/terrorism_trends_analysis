I am a registered Democrat, but cannot support your Feb. 3 editorial "Delaying Action: Democrats Stand for Principle on Gonzales." It is folly to suggest that Alberto Gonzales nomination as U.S. attorney general should have been derailed because of the alleged miscomfort of detainees at Guantanamo Bay by U.S. guards.
(He was confirmed by the Senate the day the editorial ran.)
 I wonder why the PG has more concern for these detainees who are not U.S. citizens than for the Americans who were killed on Sept. 11 by the terrorists. I wonder why the PG has more concern for the detainees who are not U.S. citizens than for Nicholas Berg and the other Americans beheaded by Islamic terrorists. Why does the PG not publish an editorial complaining that Nicholas Berg's due process rights were violated by Islamic terrorists?
 I was enrolled in graduate school at Penn State in the late 1980s. Many of the engineering graduate students were from the Middle East. They would come right out and tell you that they were advised by their governments that if and when they got in trouble with the law while in the United States, the first order of business was to claim racism as to why the authorities were investigating the situation. The U.S. civil-rights industry will be there to protect you. It is no wonder why the United States was so easy to attack on 9/11 from within its own borders. We had all of these alien criminals wandering the country, allowed to do whatever they wanted.
 The perils of detainees do not bother me. The lack of any empathy for U.S. citizens who suffered death and losses on Sept. 11 by the PG is what bothers me.
