The refusal of a Federal judge in Manhattan to extradite a member of the Provisional Irish Republican Army convicted of the murder of a British soldier was greeted with fury here by several Conservative Members of Parliament.
''This judge has given the seal of approval to murder, maiming and terrorism,'' said Jill Knight, a Conservative M.P. for Edgbaston, a district of Birmingham.
''He should understand that he has also given the green light to terrorists all over the world, who will know that so long as they use the excuse that their acts are political, the law will protect them.''
Joseph Patrick Thomas Doherty, who faces life in prison if extradited to Britain, had contended that he could not be returned here under the British- American extradition treaty because it contains an article prohibiting extradition if an offense can be considered ''one of a political character.''
Judge John E. Sprizzo of Federal District Court said the facts in Mr. Doherty's case ''present the assertion of the political offense exception in its most classic form.''
Meanwhile, a British soldier was jailed for life today for the murder of the road manager of the pop group Bananarama in Belfast. Pvt. Ian Thain was the first soldier to be found guilty of murder on duty in Northern Ireland. He was 18 years old at the time he shot Thomas Reilly, 23, during disturbances in August 1982.
