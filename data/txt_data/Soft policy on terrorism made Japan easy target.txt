WE DON'T mean to suggest unconcern for the dilemma that faced the Peruvian and Japanese governments in dealing with the terrorist incident in the Japanese Embassy in Lima, Peru, or a lack of compassion for the hundreds taken hostage. But we do wonder if there isn't some lesson in the case for all nations about the best stance to take in a dangerous world.
In past incidents involving Japanese citizens, Tokyo's position has been to negotiate and to do whatever is thought necessary to win freedom for the hostages. Japanese businesses are known to have paid millions in ransom to political and ordinary criminal groups that kidnapped their executives around the world. True to form, Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda flew to Lima last week with his government's urging against any forceful action to end the hostage crisis there.
Of course, force is not the best first response in incidents like this. Contrary to the image created by Hollywood, that isn't American practice, either. But terrorists know they aren't going to get very far making demands on Washington, and they know they risk their own lives if they kidnap U.S. citizens. It may not be coincidence that all of the Americans hostages were set free by the Tupac Amaru group.
The point is not that force is a desirable tactic, but that a policy of unflinching resistance makes it less likely that terrorists will strike this way in the first place. A policy of quick and easy acquiescence, on the other hand, paints a big red bull's-eye on every diplomat and business executive from that country. We trust that America will retain its policy of firmness ---and for the sake of innocent citizens elsewhere, we hope other nations will learn the lesson as well.
