One year after the Sept. 11 terrorist attack - and 30 months into a bear market - almost two-thirds of U.S. investors believe stock prices have further to fall, a CBS MarketWatch/CBS News investor poll shows.
Only 5 percent of the investors said they made money in the past year, while 45 percent said their retirement portfolios had lost 20 percent in value during the past two years.
Investors told the pollsters that corporate malfeasance outweighs terrorism as their top worry. Only 24 percent said terrorism had made them skittish about investing.
That certainly seemed to be the case among investors On Tuesday, as buyers pushed all the major stock indexes to modest gains despite increased anxiety on the eve of the anniversary of terrorist attacks.
Stock indexes wavered wildly during the relatively light session in response to the government's warning about the possibility of new terrorist attacks. But all the indexes closed at or near their highs for the day.
"Anxiety was running high this afternoon with the fear of yet another terrorist attack on the minds of nearly every investor," said Bernie Schaeffer, chief executive of Schaeffer's Research.
Analysts have been reluctant to draw major conclusions from this week's trading, given less-than-average trading volumes and the emotional aura of the Sept. 11 anniversary.
That would be an increase of more than 16 percent from Tuesday's close of 8,602.61.
The Dow ended with a gain of 83.23 points, or 1 percent, posting its first three-day gain since midsummer.
Standard & Poor's 500 rose 6.62 points, or 0.7 percent, to 909.58, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 15.49 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,320.09.
