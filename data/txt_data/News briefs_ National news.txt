Rare respiratory virus has been confirmed in several states
Dozens of states have confirmed cases of an enterovirus that has hospitalized hundreds of children, reported the Washington Post. Enteroviruses are extremely common and most people who contract them don't even get sick or, at the most, only get a minor cold. This rare strain, called Enterovirus 68, causes severe respiratory problems and mostly affects children.
"We're in a stage where it's difficult to say just how big this is, how long it will go on for and how widespread it will be," said Anne Schuchat, head of the CDC's National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases. Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Colorado and Kansas have confirmed cases of Enterovirus 68.

NFL terminates contract with Ray Rice after abuse scandal
Ray Rice, running back for the Baltimore Ravens, has been cut from the team and banned from the NFL indefinitely after a video surfaced of him knocking out and dragging his then-fianc√©e, Janay Palmer, out of a hotel elevator. The video, which was released by TMZ, was recorded in February 2014. Rice was indicted on third-degree assault charges, which could mean three to five years in prison. He was required to enter a program for first-time offenders that could clear the criminal charge from his record if certain conditions are met, including counseling. Rice and Palmer are now married.

New Jersey teen murdered in act of domestic terrorism
The man who shot 19-year-old Brendan Tevlin back in June said that he took Tevlin's life as "vengeance" for the "millions of lives lost every day" in countries like Iraq and Syria.
Ali Mohammad, who shot into Tevlin's car while they were stopped at an intersection in West Orange, New Jersey, told detectives "All these lives are taken every single day by America, by this government. So a life for a life," reported Fox News.
New York radio host Todd Pettengill said that this proves that "domestic terrorism is already here."
