One suspect has been apprehended and one suspect is still on the run.
One person has died and nine others have been left injured after a stabbing spree in the French city of Lyon. The motive for the attack was not clear.
Police said a 19-year-old man was killed and three of the others were in critical condition following what was described as a "frenzied" attack.
The assault occurred near a subway station in a suburb of Lyon on Saturday.
The suspect provided contradictory information to police, but the attack in the town of Villeurbanne did not appear to be terrorism-related, the official told The Associated Press. A second source close to the police said the man had told officers he was an Afghan national. Police are still looking for possible accomplices.
State health officials issue warning about mosquito-borne disease
Limit the number of places around your home for mosquitoes to breed by draining or discarding items that hold water. State health officials urged people to stay indoors from dusk until dawn and use mosquito repellent when outdoors.
The attack happened at around 4:30 pm (1430 GMT) at a bus stop near the local station.
Police, who are yet to confirm the nature of the attack, have sealed off roads near the scene and have asked the public to avoid the area as it is an active crime scene.
Last May, a parcel bomb in front of a baker's shop in central Lyon slightly injured 14 people.
Lyon, France's third city, had until then remained untouched by the wave of jihadist attacks that have killed 251 people in France since 2015.
