(RTTNews) - At least six people were injured after a female suicide bomber blew herself up near a police car in Russia&apos;s North Caucasus republic of Chechnya on Wednesday, said officials.
Russian news agencies quoting police officials said the incident occurred in central Grozny, the capital of Chechnya. Russian officials denied initial reports of fatalities, and said that the injured included four police officers and two civilians.
Wednesday&apos;s suicide bombing was the latest act of violence in Russia&apos;s troubled mountainous North Caucasus region, which has witnessed several terror attacks and frequent clashes between separatists and security forces in the recent past.
Russia had announced in April that it was formally ending its decade-long counter-terrorism operation in the volatile southern republic of Chechnya, stating that the situation in the republic has normalized to a large degree and life is getting back to normal. However, frequent bombings and clashes between militants and federal troops still disrupt life in Chechnya and nearby regions, particularly Daghestan and Ingushetia.
Late president Boris Yeltsin had imposed strict security restrictions on Chechnya at the beginning of the second Chechen war in September 1999. The operation was aimed at crushing Chechnya&apos;s post-Soviet independence movement, and the active phase of the anti-terrorism campaign officially ended in 2001.
