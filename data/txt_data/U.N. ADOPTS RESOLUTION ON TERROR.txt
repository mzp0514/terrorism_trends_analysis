The General Assembly unanimously adopted a landmark resolution today that condemns all acts of terrorism as ''criminal.''
Never before had the Assembly adopted a comprehensive resolution condeming international terrorism, and the vote taken today was praised as a step toward dealing with one of the most divisive issues before the 159-member United Nations.
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar hailed the vote as ''a truly important achievement of this 40th session,'' and ''a major move'' to deal with the problem of terrorism.
Vernon A. Walters, the chief American delegate, called the vote ''a symbol of new times.'' Referring to the recent of bombings, hijackings and hostage-takings in various parts of the world, Mr. Walters added, ''Everybody's felt the wound in their flesh.''
Oleg A. Troyanovsky, the chief Soviet delegate, said: ''It is an important resolution. We support it all the way and wholeheartedly.'' And Zehdi Labib Terzi, the United Nations observer of the Palestine Liberation Organization, called the resolution ''a historic landmark in the endeavor of the United Nations to put an end to criminal acts'' of terrorism.
Since 1972, the Assembly has been locked in a bitter struggle to come up with a universally accepted definition of terrorism.
The resolution today was adopted without a roll-call after Cuba, which had cast the sole vote against the resolution in the Assembly's legal committee last Friday, switched its position, and Israel and Burkina Faso, which had abstained, joined in the vote.
