TORONTO (AP) - The Canadian parliament voted Tuesday to end two anti-terror measures adopted in the wake of the Sept. 11 terror attacks, one that allowed for preventive arrests and another that permitted forced testimony.
The ruling conservative government wanted to extend the provisions in the country's anti-terrorism legislation, set to expire Thursday, but Prime Minister Stephen Harper's motion was defeated 159-124 in the House of Commons.
The two measures are part of the previous Liberal government's response to the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. They empower authorities to arrest and detain suspects for three days without charge and to compel individuals with knowledge of terrorist activity to testify before a judge.
Neither piece of legislation has ever been applied.
It's the second time in the span of a few days that Canada has ended portions of its anti-terror legislation. One of Canada's most contentious anti-terrorism measures was struck down Friday by the Supreme Court, which declared it unconstitutional to detain foreign terror suspects indefinitely while the courts review their deportation orders.
Human rights activists hailed Friday's ruling as a victory for those who believe fundamental rights have been curtailed in the name of national security since the Sept. 11 attacks.
Opposition Liberal Leader Stephane Dion said the measures are an unnecessary infringement on civil liberties. Dion rejected conservative Tory charges that he is soft on terrorism.
"These two provisions especially have done nothing to fight against terrorism, have not been helpful and have continued to create some risk for civil liberties," Dion said.
