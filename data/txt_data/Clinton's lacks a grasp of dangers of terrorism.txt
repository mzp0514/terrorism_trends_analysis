It seems we make up terrorist policy as time and situations demand.
I wonder how our president can explain having two of the world's leading terrorists in the White House and then bombing a suspected terrorist camp; also, a suspected chemical factory?
I am sure you all remember when the president entertained the head of the IRA in the White House and the head of the PLO, Arafat. These two men have caused more deaths than we can count due to terrorist activity.
The real insult to America came when the secretary of state, Ms. Albright, chastised Israel for retaliating against the PLO and Hamas when they used truck and personal bombs to kill Israelis.
It seems to me we have a double standard. Israel is our only ally and true friend in the Middle East and she insults them.
I guess the timing is what really upset me when the Somalis dragged the American soldiers through the street and we did nothing. That was somebody's son or father.
We also knew at that time that bin Laden was connected to those acts of violence.
We were also informed in April of this year by the CIA that this man bin Laden was planning evil acts.
I guess we can expect anything from a man who will lie to us for seven months and then refuse to apologize. I think the time has come for him - Clinton - to resign. This is by far the quickest way to put this behind us. I was not impressed with the bombing and America's double standard of morals and honesty.
