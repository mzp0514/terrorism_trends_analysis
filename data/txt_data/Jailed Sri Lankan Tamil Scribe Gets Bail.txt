(RTTNews) - A Sri Lankan Appeal Court has granted bail on health grounds to a senior Tamil journalist, sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for having links to the banned Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)--a Tamil separatist organization.
J S Tissainayagam, who was sentenced under Prevention of Terrorism Act by the Colombo High Court in August last year, was released on a cash bail of Rs 50,000 ( $500) on medical grounds by a Court of Appeal pending final hearing on his appeal against the conviction.
The 46-year-old scribe was arrested on March 7, 2008 by the Terrorism Investigation Division (TID) of the police, and sentenced to 20 years on August 31, 2009 for aiding and abetting Tamil Tiger separatism and bringing troops into disrepute through his writings between 2006 and 2007 in the now defunct North Eastern Monthly magazine.
The sentencing evoked international condemnation and calls for his unconditional release.
U.S. President Barack Obama had mentioned Tissainayagam while expressing concern over threats against the media the world over in a statement marking the World Press Freedom Day.
