Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has vowed to bring down the U.S.-backed Lebanese government, setting the stage for a showdown between America's allies in Lebanon and the country's pro-Syrian and Iranian factions allied with Hezbollah.
In comments published Tuesday in two Beirut newspapers and carried by Hezbollah's al-Manar TV station, Nasrallah said he does not plan to return to talks on the structure of the Cabinet and the government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora will soon be gone.
His comments deepened the political crisis that has been building since six ministers from Hezbollah and its allies resigned from the Cabinet last weekend.
