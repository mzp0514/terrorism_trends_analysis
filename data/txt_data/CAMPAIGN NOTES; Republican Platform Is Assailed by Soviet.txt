Official Soviet media today denounced the Republican Party platform as a ''kiddy- language document'' that will isolate the United States internationally and do nothing to improve relations with the Soviet Union.
In a series of commentaries that condemned the Republican National Convention in Dallas even before it opened, two Soviet press agencies and the Government newspaper Izvestia stressed what they called the anti-Soviet nature of President Reagan's policies and the platform.

The Government press agency Novosti said ''confrontation with the Soviet Union means playing with fire.''
Melor Sturua, a frequent commentator on United States affairs, wrote in Izvestia that the foreign policy section of the Republican platform ''is a real collection of hegemonism and international terrorism which have been elevated to the ranks of state policy'' under Mr. Reagan.
The critical comments contrasted with the Russians' far less critical treatment of the Democratic convention last month.
Of the Republican platform, a Novosti commentator, Vladimir Alekseyev wrote: ''This kiddy-language document echoes most of the inane statements made by President Reagan over the past years, which have sent shivers down the spines of people in many countries, especially Europe.''
