NEW YORK -- President Clinton, speaking at the United Nations
today, will call on countries around the world to act on a "common
obligation" to battle terrorism.
In the annual opening address to the General Assembly, Clinton
will repeat his call to tighten international banking controls,
strengthen extradition laws and improve airport security.
White House officials describe the speech as a major appeal to
other countries to join in the campaign against terrorism.
It comes a month after Clinton launched military strikes in retaliation
for embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania that were linked to
Islamic fundamentalists.
In the speech, he notes the growing number of Muslims in the United
States and denies there is any religious justification for Islamic
fundamentalists' attacks on Americans.
The United States has more than 1,200 mosques and Islamic centers
and 6 million Muslims, Clinton says. He calls for stronger ties,
not violent conflict, with Islamic nations.
But as Clinton steps to the rostrum at 10:45 a.m., his message
is likely to be overshadowed by the broadcast of his videotaped
grand jury testimony to special counsel Ken Starr.
In the U.N. speech, Clinton will say, "When it comes to terrorism,
there should be no dividing line between Moslems and Jews, Protestants
and Catholics, Serbs and Albanians, developed societies and emerging
economies.
"The only dividing line is between those who practice, support
or tolerate terror and those who understand that terrorism is
. . . murder."
