Lawmakers are scheduled to tackle terrorism insurance, industrial loan
companies, and credit cards at hearings on Capitol Hill this week.
The House Financial Services capital markets subcommittee has scheduled a
hearing for today on modifying and extending the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act.
The federal backstop for terrorism risk insurance - which was created after
the Sept. 11 attacks - is scheduled to expire at yearend, but House Financial
Services Chairman Barney Frank, D-Mass., has said it should be reauthorized for
several more years.
The insurance and banking industries have argued that continuing the
government's role is necessary to prevent coverage from becoming unavailable or
unaffordable.
On Wednesday the Financial Services Committee is scheduled to debate ILC
legislation. A bill sponsored by Rep. Frank, and Rep. Paul Gillmor, R-Ohio,
effectively would block commercial firms from owning ILCs. (See story on page
1.)
Also Wednesday, the House Education and Labor Committee plans to hold a
hearing to examine conflicts of interest and unethical practices in the student
lending business.
The hearing is intended to focus on the nature of relationships between 
lenders and college financial aid officers. Rep. George Miller, the California
Democrat who chairs the committee, has said the relationships are tainted by
"cronyism." New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo is the only witness scheduled
to testify.
On Thursday the House Financial Services financial institutions subcommittee
will hold a hearing to review credit cards. A witness list for that hearing has
not been released.
