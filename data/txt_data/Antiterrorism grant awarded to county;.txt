TAMPA - Money for the global fight against terrorism is trickling down to the local level.
The U.S. Department of Justice recently awarded a $ 250,000 grant to Hillsborough County to buy  equipment for preventing and containing acts of terrorism.
While many federal agencies have antiterrorism units, local firefighters would be the first line  of defense if terrorists strike, said Wade DeHate, special operations chief for Hillsborough County  Fire Rescue.
The federal agencies "sometimes have a window of four to six hours" before they arrive, DeHate  said. "In that window, a tremendous amount of lives can be lost."
Hillsborough is ripe for a terrorist strike because of the large amount of hazardous materials  coming into the port, DeHate said.
The federal government awarded $ 12 million to 41 jurisdictions. Eligibility was limited to the  nation's 120 largest counties and cities.
In Hillsborough, the grant will be used to buy equipment for decontamination and communications,  personal protection clothing, and equipment to detect nuclear, biological and chemical materials.
"The port and the phosphate industry generate a tremendous amount of hazardous materials," DeHate  said.
Broward, Miami-Dade, Orange and Palm Beach counties and Jacksonville also received grants.  Ken Koehn covers local government and can be reached at (813) 259-7954.
