We have problems with gun violence and terrorism, so how could the Second Amendment help? The initial intent of this amendment was a well-regulated militia to protect our fledgling country from insurgents, but right-wing politicians with backing from powerful gun lobbyists and right-wing Supreme Court justices have perverted its meaning.  
The result is arming of unregulated individuals wanting to protect themselves against the hyper-exaggerated dangers of crime, minority groups and the government itself. If we returned to the Second Amendment's original intent requiring thoroughly-screened citizens to be trained and serve in a reserve force in order to acquire military-style weapons, we would have a sizable group to utilize for guarding domestic soft targets against terrorists.  
After passing background checks, others could still get traditional guns and reasonable amounts of ammunition for self-defense, hunting and sport shooting. Such a policy would reduce gun violence because only those who are interested in protecting our communities would have access to weapons designed for military use, and terrorists would be less likely to strike because this citizen force would be on guard.  
Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan says trying to deal with gun violence is a distraction from combating terrorism, despite the fact that from 2001 to 2013, gun violence has killed over 400,000, while terrorism killed 3,300, most on 9/11. Showing such callous disregard for dealing with gun violence illustrates why Republicans need to put the safety of the country first instead of their own political agenda.
