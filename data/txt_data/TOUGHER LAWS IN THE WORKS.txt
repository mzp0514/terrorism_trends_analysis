Seeking to calm a jittery nation, President Clinton and Republican leaders yesterday began shaping a package of anti-terrorism tools, including more wiretaps and authority to prosecute terrorists as racketeers.
Sitting elbow-to-elbow with House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., Clinton declared, "When we are attacked . . . we come together."
But their sober White House meeting ended without agreement on an anti-terrorism bill. Scheduling a Capitol Hill meeting today, both sides expected a swift accord in response to the bombing at the Olympics and the explosion of TWA 800.
"We need to move as quickly as we can," Clinton said. Said Gingrich, whose home state of Georgia is hosting the Olympics: "This unites all Americans."
The tragedies emboldened Clinton's push to expand law enforcement's wiretap authority and study the safety of putting traceable markers - called "taggants" - in explosives.
The measures were dropped by Congress from an anti-terrorism bill Clinton signed April 24. Gingrich indicated Sunday his resistance was softening.
Sen. Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he might support the study, although he called taggants a red herring. Better would be making the FBI responsible for airport security, Hatch, R-Utah, said on PBS' "Newshour with Jim Lehrer."
Clinton and the leaders agreed to hold partisan fire at least until this morning, when White House chief of staff Leon Panetta meets with lawmakers to seek an agreement.
