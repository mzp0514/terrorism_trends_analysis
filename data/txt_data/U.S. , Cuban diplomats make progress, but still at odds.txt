WASHINGTON â€” U.S. and Cuban diplomats said Friday that they had made progress in talks on normalizing diplomatic relations after a five decade break, but were still at odds over Havana's demand to be taken off a U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism.
U.S. officials had hoped to move quickly on reopening embassies, leaving other issues that divide the two longtime adversaries for later. But Cuban officials have signaled that getting off the terrorism list is key to improving relations with Washington.
 Josefina Vidal, chief of the Cuban Foreign Ministry's U.S. division, told reporters after the daylong talks that removal from the terrorism list was not a precondition for renewing diplomatic ties but that it is a "very important issue" for Cuba.
 Roberta Jacobson, assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, emphasized that the U.S. views re-establishing diplomatic ties and a decision to take Cuba off the terrorism list as separate issues.
 The U.S. and Cuban diplomats met in Washington for the first time since President Barack Obama announced in December that he would ease the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba as much as he could and begin restoring diplomatic relations. Talks began last month in Havana.
 Friday's session focused on the logistics of reopening embassies in the two capitals and on basic issues of protocol, including the U.S. insistence that its diplomats in Havana are free to meet with Cuban dissidents.
 Jacobson said the U.S. hopes to reopen embassies before the Summit of the Americas, which begins April 10 in Panama. Obama plans to attend and could meet with Cuban President Raul Castro.
 No date was set for the next round of talks.
