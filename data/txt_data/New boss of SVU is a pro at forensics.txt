An NYPD veteran with a background in forensic nursing has been named the new head of the Special Victims Unit.
Deputy Inspector Michael King was tapped by Police Commissioner Dermot Shea to fill the void left by the June transfer of the unit's previous commander, Assistant Chief Judith Harrison, who now oversees Brooklyn North's 10 precincts.
King, who before his new role served as second in command of the NYPD's Joint Terrorism Task Force and prior to that headed the Crime Scene Unit, said in a statement that his new assignment "has been a dream job for me since I became a forensic nurse in 2009."
"I thought that if I could one day be the commanding officer of the Special Victims Unit, it would give me the platform I needed in my fight for victims' rights and in the pursuit of justice and integrity of special victims' investigations," King added in his statement.
The Jamaica-born cop has worked as a sexual-assault forensic examiner, with two years off-duty experience as the coordinator of Wyckoff Heights Medical Center's sexual-assault response team. He has been with the NYPD for 20 years.
Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison said he expects King will continue the reforms put in place under Harrison, making it more "victim-centered, with a relentless focus on bringing justice to brave survivors."
King said it is important for cops to show compassion and understanding with any victim, particularly those who have been sexually assaulted.
"The attitude of a patrol officer can make or break a victim wanting to go forward in reporting that complaint," King said.
