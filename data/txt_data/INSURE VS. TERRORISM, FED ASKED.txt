Sens. Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton called on the federal government yesterday to provide an insurance backstop to help protect the economy against terrorism.
Since the Sept. 11 attacks, insurers have been slashing terrorism coverage from their all-risk policies. Separate terrorism policies are pricey.
Schumer and Clinton said passing the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act would jump-start construction projects throughout the city that have been halted or scrapped because of a lack of terrorism coverage.
Under the act, the federal government would cover 80% of insured losses if the damage from a terrorist attack is less than $10 billion. If the damage exceeded $10 billion, the government would pick up 90% of the tab.
Officials from groups representing building owners, the construction trades and business executives joined the senators at a news conference to push for passage of the bill.
As of this month, more than $15.5 billion in real estate projects in 17 states have stalled or been scrapped because of the lack of terrorism insurance, according to a survey by real estate executives.
"Shovels are literally in midair and not able to go into the ground because you can't get the banks to back projects that don't have insurance," said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York.
