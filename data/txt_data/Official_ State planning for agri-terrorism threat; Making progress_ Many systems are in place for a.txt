Iowa is not completely prepared to face the threat of agri-terrorism, but it is making progress, state Homeland Security Adviser Ellen Gordon said Wednesday.
"We're a lot better prepared than we were a year ago," Gordon said.
"It will not occur overnight. We would like it to, but we're working on it."
One of the biggest obstacles will be educating the public on things people can do to prevent attacks and identify symptoms of animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth, she said.
Gordon's comments were made during the annual meeting of the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation in downtown Des Moines.
Although it might not be able to prevent a terrorist attack on the agricultural industry, the state has systems in place that would help it quickly recover from one, said David Miller, director of commodity services for the Iowa Farm Bureau.
"Our inspection system is our first line of defense," Miller said.
Farmers also can do a lot to protect themselves against agri-terrorism by taking logical precautions, Miller said.
For example, putting up fences, and controlling access to farms can hinder potential terrorists.
"In a way, it's about not being so friendly," Miller said. "It doesn't mean we have to go into isolation, but take necessary precautions."
Miller also recommended having autopsies done on all dead farm animals and reporting all missing or stolen pesticides to law enforcement officials.
But even if an agri-terrorist attack were successfully pulled off on an Iowa farm, its effect on the rest of the state would be minimal because most farms are spread throughout the state, Miller said.
