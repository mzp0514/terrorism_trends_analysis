I am appalled at the resounding lack of follow-up and continued coverage among "real" media and lawmakers regarding the Charlottesville, Va., protest disaster in August. In recent weeks I've heard otherwise highly respectable commentators gingerly note that First Amendment rights protect the racists who proudly carried swastika flags during their parade. These were in no way a demure expression of hate; they were huge emblems celebrating one of the most atrocious chapters in living memory, carried through American streets.
After any number of brutal and capricious military and cultural upheavals, the Nazis reinvented terrorism with vengeance in the Western world. The import of this so-called philosophy to America is unacceptable and not to be tolerated. America does not deal with terrorists; we appoint ourselves to, in the words of several recent presidents, root out terrorism and defeat it wherever it arises. I might add, we do this at great expense to our collective psyche and treasury. Why, then, are we so apparently comfortable and accepting of this most egregious form of terroristic threat in our own social milieu?
I will applaud leaders who have the courage and moral fabric to deny "debate" on this issue and express understanding that there are higher laws than the First Amendment. Where are they?
