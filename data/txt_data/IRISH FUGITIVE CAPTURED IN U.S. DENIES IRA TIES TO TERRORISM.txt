DUBLIN, Calif. - A man accused of being a member of the Irish Republican Army,arrested in California nine years after he escaped from a prison in Belfast, contends that he is innocent of the murder for which he was jailed.
In an interview with the Los Angeles Times on Thursday, the fugitive, Kevin Artt, also denied that he was a member of the IRA. ''I'm as far from being a terrorist as any human being can be.'' Artt was one of 38 men who escaped the Maze prison in Belfast in a mass break out in 1983. He was convicted earlier that year of the killing in 1978 of Albert Miles, a deputy warden.  In the interview, Artt, 34, insisted that he had not killed Miles and that he had been forced by British authorities to sign a bogus confession.  Artt said he had been held in isolation, denied a lawyer, and had been questioned day and night by detectives who screamed at him and hit him in the head. After a week another man was brought in who identified Artt as his accomplice, an accusation the other man later retracted, Artt said.  He said detectives had told him that his only chance was to sign a confession. Artt said he signed the confession against his will. Two years later, he was convicted and got a life term.  British authorities have asked for Artt's extradition, but first he must be tried in the United States on passport fraud charges.  At a preliminary hearing on those charges, Artt told a judge in San Francisco that he had fled to the United States to save his life.
