The terrorists do not merely object to American actions in Iraq and elsewhere - they object to our deepest values and our way of life. And if we were not fighting them in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Southeast Asia and in other places, the terrorists would not be peaceful citizens - they would be on the offense, and headed our way.
My conviction comes down to this: We do not create terrorism by fighting the terrorists. We invite terrorism by ignoring them.
The work in Iraq has been especially difficult - more difficult than we expected.
Defeatism may have its partisan uses, but it is not justified by the facts. For every scene of destruction in Iraq, there are more scenes of rebuilding and hope.
My fellow citizens: Not only can we win the war in Iraq - we are winning the war in Iraq.
It is also important for every American to understand the consequences of pulling out of Iraq before our work is done. We would abandon our Iraqi friends - and signal to the world that America cannot be trusted to keep its word.
I will make decisions on troop levels based on the progress we see on the ground and the advice of our military leaders - not based on artificial timetables set by politicians in Washington. Our forces in Iraq are on the road to victory - and that is the road that will take them home.
I know this war is controversial - yet being your president requires doing what I believe is right and accepting the consequences.
