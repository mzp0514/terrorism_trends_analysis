To the Editor:
 The Reagan Administration's campaign against the Government of Libya, the United States' third largest foreign supplier of petroleum and site of substantial U.S. corporate installations, will be widely noted abroad.v.hatever the U.S. Navy's successful provocation of a firefight with Libyan planes may have demonstrated about the sanctity of international waterways and the wages of international terrorism, it demonstrated an important point about American foreign policy:
As much as its predecessors, Ronald Reagan's conservative, business-oriented Administration is prepared to take actions in the service of what, rightly or wrongly, it conceives to be important political and strategic goals, even when they go directly counter to major American economic interests in a third-world country.
Feisty governments as different in their orientations as Nigeria and South Africa will certainly note that providing the United States with strategic resources and courting United States investment will little avail them should their political actions run counter to some Washington Administration's view of ''responsible'' international behavior.
