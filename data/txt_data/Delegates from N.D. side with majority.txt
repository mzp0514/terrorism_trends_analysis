North Dakota's congressional delegation joined the majority of federal lawmakers to override the president's veto of legislation to allow families of Sept. 11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia for its alleged backing of the attackers.
"We are sending a clear message to any foreign power abetting or harboring terrorists that they will be held responsible for terrorist acts on U.S. soil," Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., said in a statement Wednesday.
The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act amends a 1976 law granting other countries immunity from American lawsuits. The bill initially passed the Senate on May 17 and the House on Sept. 9. President Barack Obama vetoed the bill on Friday.
"No family member who has lost a loved one to terrorism should be denied their right to seek justice, regardless of whether the perpetrator is a government or a country," Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., said in a statement.
The Senate veto override vote was 97-1, and the House vote was 348-77.
"Today's veto override by Congress is a strong affirmation of accountability and justice. Fifteen years later, it gives the victims and their families of the 9/11 attacks another avenue to seek justice and have their day in court," Rep. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said in a statement.
