Americans, especially immigrants, must keep watch on the government's new anti-terrorism laws, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union said.
"We need to be vigilant," said Anthony Romero, the keynote speaker for the Latino Leadership Awards Brunch said on Saturday at the University of Iowa.
"The war on terrorism cannot be an excuse for the government to do whatever it wants."
Since Sept. 11, the U.S. government has taken certain actions that are threatening civil liberties in the name of national security and the war on terrorism, Romero said.
This, he said, can't be.
"We are not challenging the need to be safe; just that we are kept safe and free," he said.
In September, Romero became the first Latino to take the helm of the 81-year-old ACLU, the nation's leading civil-liberties organization.
The ACLU recently has drawn fire from conservatives who argue that authorities need more power to stop terrorist attacks.
Romero rebutted those accusations: "It is our critics themselves who are out of touch."
He said that those who question the federal government and its tactics are not disloyal, but are practicing civil responsibility. "We are no more naive or radical than the founding fathers," Romero said.
ACLU officials have sharply criticized some of the tools in the war on terrorism, including racial profiling, government wiretaps and tribunals.
Government officials have arrested or detained more than 1,200 people since Sept. 11, Romero said.
