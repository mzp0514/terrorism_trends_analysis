Since August, bombs have become the chief substitute for ballots among the political enemies of Ferdinand E. Marcos, President of the Philippines. Last week, such a vote was cast in the presence of the President himself, when a bomb exploded in a Manila convention hall where 3,500 delegates of the American Society of Travel Agents were gathered to hear an address by Mr. Marcos.
AN-AHe escaped injury, as did the United States Ambassador, Richard W. Murphy, but 20 people were injured, none fatally.
The travel agents had been warned in a letter last month, signed by an anti-Marcos group called the April 6 Liberation Movement, not to attend the meeting, and another dissident group, based in the United States, pointed out that bombing the convention would ''shake the confidence of the people in Marcos's ability to maintain peace and order.''
After the bombing, President Marwarned that if such terrorism continued, he said, he would not lift martial law, imposed eight years ago, in March as he had been thinking of doing. Arrest warrants in connection with the bombing were issued for 30 of Mr. Marcos's political enemies, most of whom, including the archenemy, former Senator Benigno S. Aquino Jr., are in the United States.
