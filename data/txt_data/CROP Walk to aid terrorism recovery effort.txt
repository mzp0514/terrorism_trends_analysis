Church World Service's Domestic Terrorism Recovery Program will benefit from this year's annual CROP Walk for the Hungry.
The 28th annual walk will be held rain or shine on Sunday, Oct.  21, beginning at 1 p.m.
The Lancaster walk begins and ends at the Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church, 64 Hershey Ave.
#CROP.O12BKS2#
Other walks will be held in Columbia, Denver, Donegal/Conoy, Elizabethtown, Ephrata, Willow Street/Lampeter, Lititz, Millersville, Mount Joy, Mountville, New Holland, Paradise, Solanco and Strasburg.
The CROP walk is chaired by the Rev. Alexander Veronis, with the Rev. Donald Zechman as co-chairman.
This year's goal for the county is $145,000, $5,000 more than was raised last year.
Over the years that countians have gained sponsors willing to pledge their support for CROP, they have raised more than $3 million here.
Local food banks will receive 25 percent of the money raised. The terrorism recovery program, established after the national disaster on Sept. 11, will receive 10 percent.
The remainder of the funds will benefit hungry people in 80 countries.
Most of the county walks will be 10K, or 6.2 miles, with options for 1K, 2K or 5K. For information and sponsor sheets, call 394-1735.
