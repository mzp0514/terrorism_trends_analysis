The United States Tuesday gave Israel its support for retaliation
against the Palestinian group Hamas, blamed for 57 deaths in a wave
of bombing attacks over the last 10 days.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher said "there is an
understanding that Israel needs to take strong action to defeat the
terrorism . . . so deadly to its citizens."
Israel rejected Hamas' latest cease-fire offer, and stepped up
its offensive.
Soldiers raided a West Bank village, contained 1 million
Palestinian residents by closing borders and raided academic and
charitable groups in areas linked to violence.
President Clinton will dispatch bomb detection equipment to
Israel and terrorism experts to train and equip Israeli and
Palestinian officials.
Clinton, fearing outrage over the bombings could torpedo Mideast
peace talks, told Israelis in a TV address, "We stand with you today
to bring this horror to an end and bring those responsible to
justice."
He also warned that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat "must do
everything possible to end this campaign of terror."
GOP presidential hopeful Bob Dole said unless Arafat takes
"serious anti-terrorism actions," $ 340 million in pledged U.S. aid
to his government may be jeopardized.
Arafat ordered his police to raid a West Bank teacher's college
suspected of terrorism.
Christopher called his Syrian counterpart Farouk Shara to stress
the need to fight terrorism. He also singled out Iran as "deeply
involved" in aiding the Hamas bombers.
