Casey Barth kicked a 21-yard field goal on the final play, and North Carolina stopped Virginia Tech all night in a 20-17 victory on Thursday night in Blacksburg, Va.
The Tar Heels (5-4, 1-3 ACC) forced a fumble by Ryan Williams at his 24-yard-line with 2:02 left and turned it into the winning drive.
The Hokies (5-3, 3-2), who until losing to No. 11 Georgia Tech 12 days ago were in the national championship picture, lost their second straight. They entered the game No. 13 in the BCS poll.
The Tar Heels held Virginia Tech to 95 rushing yards and limited Williams for most of the game.
Tydreke Powell caused Williams to fumble and Deunta Williams recovered, setting the Tar Heels up at the Hokies 24. After six carries by Ryan Houston got it to the 4, Barth's second field goal finished off the upset.
