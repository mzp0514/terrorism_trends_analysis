Dear Editor: I would have to disagree with Kevin J. Mack's contention that war is not necessary in defeating terrorism. While war is traditionally thought of in terms of an armed conflict, that is not necessarily the case as we have seen in the Cold War with the USSR occurring over several U.S. presidents' terms.
War can and should also be thought of as a struggle or competition between opposing forces or for a particular end such a class war, or a war against disease or drugs and of course terrorism.
The success in our war against terrorism is dependent on a multifaceted approach that doesn't rely only on armed conflict but on gathering intelligence, infiltrating terrorist cells and demonstrating to potential terrorists that terrorists' actions in purposefully killing innocent civilians as occurred on 9/11 and around the world - not only in England but in Spain, Lebanon, Israel, Indonesia, etc. - are wrong and self-defeating.
When Mack suggests "every one of us has a much greater risk of death by drunken driver or death by myocardial infarction than ever being anywhere near any terrorist attack," he neglects to give the Bush administration any credit for this. The seeds were planted and most of the planning for 9/11 took place before Bush took office and once it took place we have been free of similar attacks despite threats of further carnage on our "satanic nation" by leaders of various terrorist organizations.
