In response to Tuesday's chaos in New York and Washington D.C., the Montana World Affairs Council will hold a forum to discuss the scars left by terrorism and how to begin healing.
"We have an obligation to provide education to citizens about world events," said Mark Johnson, director of the Montana World Affairs Council.
U. MontanaJohnson, who has spent time in the Middle East as a diplomat, said the forum will be organized within the next two weeks.
Although the panel has not been confirmed, Johnson said he hopes to invite experts on terrorism and people who have survived tragic events as well as using insight from his experiences.
Johnson said Tuesday's terrorist attacks made him feel sick.
"The last time I felt like this, I was a sophomore in high school in Great Falls, and it was because the U.S. might go to nuclear war -- the Cuban Missile Crisis," he said.
During those days, before the Soviet Union backed down, Malmstrom Air Force Base outside of Great Falls was on "full alert," he said, and Tuesday may have been the first time it was on full alert since those days in 1961.
Johnson said he is no stranger to violence, due to his experience in the Middle East, but said he's faced nothing of this scope.
"This is a faceless, nameless, horrible attack," he said. "A scene from a living hell."
