To the Editor:
''What do the terrorists want?'' you ask (''Bring Americans Along on Terrorists,'' editorial, Aug. 9).
The same things in the Middle East that the Irish Republican Army has been fighting for in Northern Ireland for 70 years: recognition, self-determination, noninterference by ''imperialist powers.''
Is it too much to suggest that terrorism will be linked to Israeli and American targets so long as we fail to deal with root causes? And that dialogue with Iran and the Shiites should be coupled with an effort to talk with all parties about a settlement?
With the Soviets and our moderate Arab friends, we could orchestrate a beginning of (1) a political settlement in Lebanon; (2) a settlement based on land and disarmament and demilitarized areas in the West Bank, Gaza and the Golan in exchange for recognition of Israel, and (3) international guarantees of the status quo in Jerusalem and assurances of access to the holy places for all three religions.
My first Foreign Service posting was Jerusalem. David Ben-Gurion told us one time that Israel wanted a long-term peace based on satisfying the Palestinians with their own state if they wanted it. He would not hesitate now.
Terror is not a disease to be cured. It is a symptom of something deeply wrong in the body politic. Let's cure it. We know how.
