(RTTNews) - More than 150 Yemeni Muslim clerics and Islamist leaders have threatened to declare &apos;Jihad,&apos; (holy war) if any foreign troops entered the Arab country to fight al-Qaeda.
Yemen&apos;s council of clerics met Thursday in a mosque in capital Sanaa was presided over by Sheikh Abdul-Majeed al-Zindani, who is wanted by the United States over terrorism funding charges.
In a statement issued after the conclave, the clerics said: "It is a duty to resort to Jihad if the country is invaded by foreign troops."
Addressing a press conference, al-Zindani said: "If any party insists on aggression, or invades the country, then according to Islam, Jihad (holy war) becomes obligatory." He is also believed to be a spiritual leader to terror mastermind Osama bin Laden.
Despite being Yemen&apos;s ally in the fight against terrorism, the Obama administration recently ruled out deploying US ground forces to the militancy-hit Gulf country.
But on Wednesday, senior US Senator Carl Levin called upon Washington to consider drone attacks against al-Qaeda extremists in Yemen.
The Democrat lawmaker from Michigan urged airstrikes, undercover operations, and increased US military aid to Sana&apos;a as options that Washington should consider in dealing with the "threat from al-Qaeda militants" in Yemen.
