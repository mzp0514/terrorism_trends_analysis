The trial of a Portuguese revolutionary leader and 72 other defendants accused of terrorism was suspended today, on the same day it opened.
Judge Adelino Salvado suspended the trial until Oct. 7 because a key witness had been shot and was in a hospital and because of delays in selecting a jury.
Trial of Lieut Col Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho, Portuguese revolutionary leader, and 72 other defendants accused of terrorism is suspended until October because key witness was recently shot seven times (S)
The main defendant is Lieut. Col. Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho, organizer of the army-led revolution in 1974 that ended nearly 50 years of dictatorship.
The witness, 34-year-old Jose Rosa Barradas, was shot seven times on Friday by suspected members of the Popular Forces of April 25, a terrorist band that the state charges Colonel Saraiva de Carvalho organized and led.
The colonel appeared relaxed as defense lawyers charged in a procedural battle with the prosecution that they had not been able to examine much of the evidence. The lawyers also said they had had little access to their clients and to the 500 witnesses to be called by the court.
Only 26 of a pool of 50 jurors appeared today. Questioning of the prospective jurors to arrive at a final eight did not begin as scheduled today.
