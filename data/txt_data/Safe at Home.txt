THE November House elections have now been nationalized. Republicans won't win by saying, ''Elect the incumbent.'' They can still win, however, by embracing the national nature of the contest and emphasizing their strengths: protecting us from terrorism; creating a thriving American economy. 
  First, there have been no terrorist attacks on America since 9/11. The partisan rebuttal by the Democrats is that this is just good luck. The Republicans should vigorously respond that the good luck explanation is dangerously irresponsible. There are debatable aspects of the war on terrorism, but the results are not attributable simply to good luck. They are the direct result of steps taken by the president and supported by Congress.
Second, look at our economy. Real economic growth, real personal take-home income, numbers of those employed -- all are at record highs. This is also not the result of good luck. The robust economy stems from actions the Republican president and Congress have taken and (wisely) not taken. Republicans let working men and women keep more of the fruits of what they create. Republicans have not built up unnecessary regulations and costs on those who create jobs. 
  The contest will then be between the Democrats' national issues (Iraq and management of the House) versus the Republicans' national issues (protecting us from terrorism and providing more jobs for Americans). Republicans can win that battle.
  -- TOM CAMPBELL, Republican representative from California from 1989 to 1993 and 1995 to 2001.
