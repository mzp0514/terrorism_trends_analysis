A NEW YORK member of the U.S. Coast Guard fell overboard to his death during a nighttime anti-terrorism training exercise in Virginia, authorities said.
The gear-laden body of the third-class petty officer, whose name was not immediately released, was recovered from Chesapeake Bay last night.
The guardsman was part of a team that was being trained on Wednesday night to capture a ship taken over by terrorists.
He had climbed out of a 25-foot craft and grabbed hold of a ladder on the outside of a 175-foot Coast Guard cutter when he fell into the water during high tide.
His crew began hunting for him, but he didn't resurface, authorities said.
The victim was wearing some 60 pounds of gear, including body armor required during anti-terrorism training missions.
He also had on a personal flotation device, but it's not known whether it inflated properly, Lt. J.G. Scott McBride told the Virginian-Pilot newspaper.
"We know he had on the same kind [of flotation device] that's a standard part of our tactical gear, but that's all we can say right now," McBride said.
The victim's body was found about 5 p.m. yesterday after an all-day search involving numerous agencies.
"It is a difficult task to conduct any search and rescue operation, even more so when it is one of your own that needs help," said Coast Guard Capt. Mark Ogle.
