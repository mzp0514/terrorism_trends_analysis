The news has once again linked terrorism to our home state, a stark reminder that Mainers are on the front lines of this new war.
Soon after the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, a local connection to the terrorists was made.
Two of them came through the Portland International Jetport on their deadly mission.
Now new connections are emerging, placing Portland in the middle of a scheme to funnel money to people who are suspected members of the al-Qaida network.
As more of these connections are unearthed, Mainers are tempted to ask, why here? Why would the terrorists bother to come to this place, a place seemingly out of the way?
That might be the wrong question. Perhaps more meaning can be found by asking, Why not here?
We're so used to seeing ourselves as a place apart. Indeed, we've long been defined by a perception of remoteness. If that were ever true, however, it's certainly not so today. Air travel, e-mail, mobile communications, highways and shipping logistics have all combined to put Maine closer to the rest of the country.
This closeness means we cannot take our safety for granted. When word goes out that Americans should be on high alert, that means us, too. The world has changed, including Maine.
