The chief executive officers of 30 of the country's largest financial services companies signed a letter to President Bush Wednesday, calling for the federal government to assure that insurance against terrorist acts continues to be available in the United States.
The letter, sent by the Financial Services Roundtable, argued that the massive devastation of last month's attacks on New York and Washington made it clear that "policies for acts of terrorism are impossible to price, and therefore impossible to write."
The letter did not specify steps the government should take, but warned that without some sort of action "it could become impossible for primary insurers to renew contracts with reinsurers at year's end, thereby putting further downward pressure on economic activity and possibly curtailing the benefits of the administration's efforts to stimulate the economy."
One proposal being considered on Capitol Hill is to make the federal government an "insurer of last resort," guaranteeing the obligations of insurance companies too badly hit by terrorism-related losses to pay off their claims.
Among the CEOs who signed the letter were Edward B. Rust Jr. of State Farm Insurance Cos.; William F. Aldinger of Household International Inc.; Jerry A. Grundhofer of U.S. Bancorp; L. Phillip Humann of SunTrust Banks Inc.; Richard M. Kovacevich of Wells Fargo & Co.; Thomas A. Renyi of Bank of New York Co. Inc.; and G. Kennedy Thompson of Wachovia Corp. --
