A U.S. military tribunal sentenced an Australian to nine months in prison Friday after he pleaded guilty of supporting terrorism - the first conviction at a U.S. war crimes trial since World War II.
A panel of military officers had recommended a term of seven years, but a plea agreement that had been kept secret from the panel capped the sentence at nine months for David Hicks. He has been held at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay for more than five years.
Hicks, 31, appeared relieved as the judge, Marine Corps Col. Ralph Kohlmann, disclosed the agreement.
The United States had agreed to let Hicks serve his sentence in Australia, and he is to leave the Cuba-based prison within 60 days under the plea agreement. 
Hicks confirmed to the judge that he conducted surveillance on the former U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan.
Hicks also stipulated under his plea deal that he has "never been illegally treated by a person or persons while in the custody of the U.S. government," Kohlmann said.
Furthermore, the judge said, the agreement bars Hicks from suing the U.S. government for alleged abuse, forfeits any right to appeal his conviction and imposes a gag order that prevents him from speaking with news media for a year from his sentencing.
Hicks previously reported being beaten and deprived of sleep during his more than five years at the prison.
Hicks was captured in Afghanistan in December 2001.
