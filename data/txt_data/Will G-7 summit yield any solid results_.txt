During the Group of Seven summit this week in Germany, major talking points included climate change, terrorism and the conflict in Ukraine.
Russia normally attends the meeting but was excluded because it annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. President Obama and the other G-7 leaders should be very careful about pushing Russian President Vladimir Putin too far.
Dennis Buckley
What does the G-7 summit mean for most ordinary people? Nothing, because even if our "leaders" say there's a recovery, many of us see only poor workers. And the goal seems to be to make a war against Russia, which would destroy Europe.
Marc Laurent
Obama should stop wasting time at the G-7 and get home to deal with the  U.S. debt, uncontrolled immigration, bloated government and racial tension.
John Hipp
It's unlikely that proposed changes  will have any meaningful impact on the climate. The way to curb the influence of mankind is to stop population growth. Climate change is a perfect political issue. It allows politicians to spend more money while not being held accountable for the long-term results.
Larry Gilbert
If you don't take care of terrorism, the climate will make no difference.
Chance Burton
Terrorism is one of the most important issues for our society. For now, our officials appear to be doing little to fight the Islamic State, also known as ISIL.
