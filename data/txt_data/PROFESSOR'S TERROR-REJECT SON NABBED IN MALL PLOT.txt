A WEALTHY Massachusetts college professor's son was arrested yesterday for plotting to shoot up a mall after he was rejected by all the terrorist groups he had contacted for training.
Tarek Mehanna, 27, who blogs about Islam under the name Abu Sabaya, was charged with conspiring to become a jihadist and kill Americans. His plans, all failed, included assassinating two top politicians, attacking U.S. troops in Iraq and mowing down shoppers.
His laptop had photos of him grinning at Ground Zero, and he distributed video files online of U.S. soldiers' remains being mutilated in Iraq, prosecutors said.
Since 2000, Mehanna had tried to join terrorists in Iraq, Yemen and Pakistan, prosecutors said, but he kept getting told, "We don't need you," an informant's recording showed.
Mehanna is a graduate of the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy, where his father, Ahmed Mehanna, is a professor. It was the fifth homegrown terrorism bust in as many months.
The FBI said Mehanna and pal Daniel Maldonado, who is in jail on terrorism charges, talked of "making peanut butter and jelly" - code for waging holy war.
Mehanna; his friend Ahmad Abousamra, who has since fled to Syria, and a third unidentified man had planned in 2003 to attack an American mall but never followed through because they couldn't get their hands on any automatic weapons, officials said.
They also considered assassinating two politicians, whose names were not revealed.
