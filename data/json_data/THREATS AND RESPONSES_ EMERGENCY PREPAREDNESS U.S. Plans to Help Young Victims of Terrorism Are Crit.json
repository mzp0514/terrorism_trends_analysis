Paramedics who could be called to a gassed school or a bombed bus do not routinely receive specialized training in things like finding smaller veins or using smaller tracheotomy tubes in children thrashing around in fear or in steeling themselves against the shock of having to treat a room full of dying children.\nWith war now imminent, \"it's a matter of national urgency that we move as quickly as possible to protect our children,\" Dr. Irwin Redlener, a member of the task force on terrorism of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said yesterday.\nExperiences with anthrax in the United States and sarin gas in Japan suggest that ill-prepared family doctors sometimes send unhurt but worried patients to emergency rooms, overwhelming them; frantic parents compound the problem.\nWhen experts convened in Washington recently to discuss the problem, 78 percent of them said the country would not be ready to help children if terrorists struck the next day. Asked if pediatric issues were addressed in state and local emergency planning, 78 percent answered \"minimally\" and 7 percent answered \"not at all.\"\nThe conference, Pediatric Preparedness for Disasters and Terrorism, was organized by the Children's Health Fund and Montefiore Children's Hospital to find and fix flaws in the emergency-response system.\nThere are relatively few American models of mass deaths of children for experts to study. Cited most often are the 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City federal office building, where a child-care center was destroyed, and school shootings like those at Columbine High School in Colorado. The last time a great number of small American children were killed was 45 years ago in a fire at Our Lady of Angels school in Chicago, where 90 died. \nAs a result, American experts frequently look to Israel, where youngsters have been killed in bombings of buses and pizzerias and where lessons in donning gas masks are sandwiched between spelling and math. \nFocusing on saving children requires thinking in ways that are sometimes counterintuitive, experts said. For example, schools that normally conduct fire drills, which focus on getting students out of the building quickly, may need to practice radiation or gas drills that keep them inside and away from windows, which must be sealed. Experts also said that teachers should know how to control bleeding and give cardiopulmonary resuscitation, how to inject children with atropine to counter the effects of nerve gas and when to administer potassium iodide pills to protect them from radiation.\nIssuing gas masks to children is not being recommended. Few American parents know how to use them, and even in Israel, where many parents do, a handful of children accidentally suffocated in them during missile attacks in the gulf war, the Israeli defense ministry reports.\nChildren are more vulnerable to gas attacks because they breathe faster, said Dr. Louis Z. Cooper, former president of the American Academy of Pediatrics and a terrorism expert. They have smaller volumes of blood and body fluids, so they can bleed to death quickly or dehydrate from vomiting or diarrhea. They need child-sized gas masks, neck braces and other equipment and pediatric doses of emergency drugs in forms they can swallow.\nEven doctors may need extra training, said Dr. David Markenson, medical director of the program for pediatric preparedness at Montefiore Hospital, in the Bronx, and not just in techniques, but in the mental toughness to make the right decisions in a crisis. Internists who routinely treat adults, Dr. Markenson said, \"are often afraid of taking care of children\" for fear of giving them the wrong dose or simply of failing.\nBrenda Z. Greene, the National School Boards Association school health chief, said: \"First-responders need to be prepared. Remember the reminder we get on airplanes? 'If the masks drop, put yours on first before you take care of children.' \"\nIn Oklahoma City, Dr. Markenson said, some firefighters still deny being at the bombing even though there are pictures of them taking care of children who died. \"They're in such denial that their minds totally black out the event,\" he said. \nTrauma counseling for children needs to be tailored by age, the experts say. Those younger than 5 may become clingy and frightened, for example, but recover quickly, depending on how their parents react. Children 6 to 11 may have nightmares, psychosomatic illnesses or get into trouble at school; teenagers may have the same broad range of reactions as adults, including heroism, fury, denial or suicide attempts.\nThe worst way to handle an attack is to refuse to talk about it, Dr. Markenson said, because children get the message that it is too awful to discuss, which increases their fear.\nAt the Washington conference, pediatricians complained that there are no federally accepted standards for children's doses of potassium iodide against thyroid cancer, of atropine and pralidoxime against nerve gas or of antibiotics against anthrax. So a committee of experts wrote its own and will soon disseminate them to emergency-response agencies, perhaps as early as next week, Dr. Redlener said.\nAn example of the dosage problem, said Dr. Fred N. Henretig, head of the poison control center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, are injector kits for counteracting nerve gas. The kits, made for soldiers, contain three sets of spring-loaded syringes with measured doses of the atropine and pralidoxime, \"an idiotproof way of giving an injection on the battlefield,\" he said. \nThe kits have been issued to many paramedic squads who might come upon \"a scene of hundreds of people down on the ground dying of nerve gas where you wouldn't have time to set up IV's,\" he said. But there are no American standards for using them on children, even though the American company that makes them also makes a pediatric version for Israel.\nEven family doctors who will probably never see crisis patients need to hear some sound advice, Dr. Markenson said. \"During the anthrax scare, people called their internists and pediatricians and said, 'I have a rash,' and the internist would say 'Go to the emergency room and tell them you might have anthrax.' \" \nAs happened in the 1995 sarin gas attack in the Tokyo subways, such a mistake spread the fear and overwhelmed emergency rooms. \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPhoto: Schoolchildren in Israel, like this one, routinely take part in drills to prepare for terrorist attacks.
