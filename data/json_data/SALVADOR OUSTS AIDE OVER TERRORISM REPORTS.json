He asserted that Mr. Santivanez had received payments for his statements to members of Congress and to news organizations.\nThe Times has not identified by name a former Salvadoran military official who it said made such accusations against Salvadoran military and civilian leaders.\nThe official quoted in The Times's dispatch was promised $50,000 by a group of Americans who wanted him to speak out. The group said the money had been promised to help support the official, move his family from El Salvador and meet other expenses.\nAmong the allegations he made in the March 3 article in The Times were that the network of death squads was shaped by leading officials, including Col. Nicolas Carranza, chief of the treasury police, and Jose Guillermo Garcia, former Minister of Defense. The former official was also quoted in The Times as having said that Roberto d'Aubuisson, a former army officer who finished second in the recent Salvadoran presidential elections, continued to direct and organize the death squads."
