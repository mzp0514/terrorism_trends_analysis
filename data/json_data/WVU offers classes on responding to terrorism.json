We were one of the first in the country.\"\nNever has terrorism defense caught the attention of so many West Virginians, though. This year, the extension service is offering a new course, \"Domestic Preparedness.\" It teaches emergency and medical workers how to initiate the correct response to a nuclear, biological or chemical attack.\nThe original \"emergency response\" course teaches them how to recognize a terrorist attack and then protect themselves and the public.\nThe instructors are trained by National Fire Academy teachers. The extension service has an $ 80,000 federal grant to teach the classes.\nThe instructors will travel anywhere in West Virginia, provided they've got a class of at least 10 firefighters, police officers, EMS workers or hospital personnel and a suitable place to hold the classes. The courses are usually two days long. The emergency response course is free. The domestic preparedness course may have a small fee for student manuals and the like, Johnson said.\nFor information, call Johnson at 293-2106.\nTo contact staff writer Tara Tuckwiller, use e-mail or call 348-5189.\n\nLoad-Date: November 13, 2001"
