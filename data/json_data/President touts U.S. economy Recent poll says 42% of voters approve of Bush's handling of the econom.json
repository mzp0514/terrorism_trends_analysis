    "full text": "President Bush on Monday trumpeted the strength of the economy, an important issue in about two dozen congressional races that will determine whether Republicans retain control of the House.\nFaced with difficult midterm elections and a deteriorating situation in Iraq, Bush is stressing the positive.\n\"The strength of this economy depends upon the strength of the small-business sector,\" Bush said at a round-table where he talked about his administration's role in reducing taxes and limiting regulation and lawsuits that he says impede the entrepreneurial spirit in America.\n\"The role of the government, it seems to me, is to make sure that dreamers are rewarded for their hard work and their ingenuity and success. And the best way to do that is to reduce taxes on people,\" Bush said.\nWhite House advisers insist that Bush is not trying to change the subject away from the unpopular war. The president will continue to talk about Iraq and the war on terrorism as the Nov. 7 election nears, they said.\nEighty-eight percent of likely voters say the economy is an important issue - on a par with the percentage of people who view the situation in Iraq and terrorism as crucial matters, according to an Associated Press-Ipsos poll earlier this month. The poll found that 37 percent of likely voters say they approve of Bush's handling of Iraq overall. More voters - 42 percent - approve of his handling of the economy.\nOverall, the economy grew at a 2.6 percent pace from April through June, compared with a 5.6 percent pace over the first three months of the year, which was the strongest spurt in 21/2 years.\n\nLoad-Date: October 24, 2006"
