    "full text": "IN February 1993, terrorists bombed the parking garage beneath\nthe World Trade Center in New York City.  The damage was relatively\nminor and the twin towers re-opened.\nNow the World Trade Center is under attack again, this time by\nmore efficient predators _ lawyers.\nThe port authority that owns the building has been hit with 181\nlawsuits from tenants and insurers.  They seek $ 1.9 billion in\ndamages.  That is three times the $ 665 million in property claims\npaid in 1993 in the state of New York.\n\"I'm still trying to figure out how you're negligent if it's an\nact of terrorism,\" said Jeffrey Green, general counsel for the Port\nAuthority of New York and New Jersey.\nIt is interesting to see who has filed the suits.  Insurance\ncompany officials, who often bad-mouth America's legal system, are\ntrying to get back the $ 510 million they paid in claims for property\ndamages and the interruption of business.\n\"It's called subrogation.  Insurance companies do not pay any\nlarge losses without a fight,\" said insurance lawyer Eugene Anderson\n.  \"I call it insurance nullification by litigation.\"\nThe other suits are filed by tenants.  Stock brokerage houses\nand other businesses seek reimbursement of their insurance\ndeductibles.\nAs usual, punitive damages are sought.  Wouldn't be a civil case\nnowadays without the plaintiff seeking bushels full of money beyond\nthe actual damage suffered.\nSo there's really no need for terrorists from the Middle East\n.  U.S. lawyers need no help in undermining America's judicial system\n.-30-\n\nLoad-Date: January 31, 1995"
