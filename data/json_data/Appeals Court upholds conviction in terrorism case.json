    "full text": "Mar. 23--The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has upheld the conviction of a former Wilkes-Barre man found guilty of attempting to help al-Qaida terrorists blow up fuel pipelines and refineries in the United States, federal prosecutors announced Monday.\nMichael Curtis Reynolds, 51, appealed his 2007 federal court conviction, arguing the government produced insufficient evidence, prosecutors acted \"vindictively\" by charging him as a terrorist and that he was not brought to trial quickly enough.\nThe appeals court said Reynolds failed to prove there was insufficient evidence and his other arguments were \"meritless.\"\nU.S. District Court Judge Edwin M. Kosik sentenced Reynolds to 30 years in a federal prison after a jury convicted him of attempting to provide material support to al-Qaida and four other charges.\nReynolds lived at 346 Scott St. in Wilkes-Barre for nearly a year, residing there from July 2004 until spring 2005. He claims he was a patriot who was working undercover to catch terrorists.\nProsecutors argued Reynolds tried to help al-Qaida units destroy pipelines to recreate the soaring gasoline prices caused by Hurricane Katrina. He was motivated to assist in the proposed attack in protest of the war in Iraq and because of \"his own personal greed,\" prosecutors alleged.\nReynolds communicated on the Internet with someone he believed was an al-Qaida operative, but was a cooperating FBI witness, a Montana municipal court judge who helps the FBI catch terrorists and terrorist sympathizers online.\nFBI agents captured Reynolds on Dec. 5, 2005 when he arrived at a truck stop in Idaho to pick up $40,000, which was to be partial payment \"for his services and future service to the al-Qaida terrorists,\" prosecutors said.\n\"Fortunately, Reynolds' plan was reported to the FBI just as it was beginning,\" U.S. Attorney Dennis C. Pfannenschmidt's office said in a press release Monday.\nThroughout his legal troubles, Reynolds claimed the FBI was framing him and someone stole his identity to contact with the FBI witness. He fired two of his court-appointed attorneys, demanded he be allowed to represent himself at trial and filed 20 motions on his own behalf, including one that claimed the government owes him $400 million in damages.\nAfter a weeklong trial, a federal jury deliberated for an hour before convicting Reynolds on July 13, 2007 of the terrorism charges.\nReynolds remains jailed at a federal penitentiary in Allenwood, scheduled to be released on Jan. 24, 2032, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\nbkalinowski@citizensvoice.com, 570-821-2055\nSign up for Text Alerts\nSign up for e-mail newsletters\nTo see more of The Citizens' Voice or to subscribe to the newspaper, visit http://www.citizensvoice.com/.
