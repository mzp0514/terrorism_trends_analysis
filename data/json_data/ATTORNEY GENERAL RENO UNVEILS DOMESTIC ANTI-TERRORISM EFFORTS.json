Usually, the first to arrive at the chaotic and dangerous scene are local rescue squads, firefighters and police. \"For many victims, what these first responders do in those first few minutes can mean the difference between life and death,\" she said.\nState and local officials responsible for these efforts have complained in recent years that federal aid - either training or equipment - is hard to find and inadequate and that some federal agencies duplicate the work of others while gaps remain.\nThe new program \"is trying to address the issues that first responders have raised and create a two-way street so that we hear from them; that we provide one central place where they can go, knowing that they will get the best information, both from the FBI, the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, the Public Health Service; and that they will get the latest information with respect to equipment,\" Reno said.\nUnder a new interagency agreement, the Justice Department and the FBI will take over from the Defense Department as the coordinator, financed by $ 49 million from the Pentagon in the coming fiscal year.\nThe program will train state and local workers; distribute money to buy equipment; set up joint federal, state and local practice exercises; and work with state and local officials to draft contingency plans unique to each local situation, Reno said. \"State and local governments (will be) a full partner in the planning effort, since they know what they need there at the front line,\" she said.\nThe FBI has been investigating a rising number of suspected biological, chemical or nuclear-radiological incidents - 68 in 1997 and 86 in 1998. But Bob Blitzer, chief of the FBI's domestic terrorism unit, said, \"The vast majority of these are hoaxes.\"\nBlitzer said the bureau believed that it had averted four or five potential attacks in recent years.\nMany fire departments have good hazardous materials units to deal with chemical attacks, and for many years there has been \"a pretty robust capability to handle\" nuclear-radiological attacks, Blitzer said.\n\"The real weakness that we have right now is the ability to detect and counter a (biological attack), because it's much more insidious and much more difficult to detect,\" Blitzer said. \"There's certainly less protection, particularly on the medical side.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO Photo Headshot - (Bob) Blitzer\n\nLoad-Date: October 17, 1998"
