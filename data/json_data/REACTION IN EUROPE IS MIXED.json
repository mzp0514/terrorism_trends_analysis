    "full text": "Reaction in Europe to reports that the United States provided military spare parts to Iran and secretly negotiated with Teheran in an attempt to free American hostages in Lebanon ranged from support in Italy to caution and restraint on the part of British officials to chiding comments by the French Foreign Minister.\nWhile Government officials in many countries preferred to adopt a wait-and-see attitude, many news organizations were quick to label the American action ''hypocritical,'' saying Washington was pursuing a ''risky'' course.\n''Everything leads one to think that they did in fact negotiate, even though quite often they criticize us, saying we should never negotiate with terrorists,'' said the French Foreign Minister, Jean-Bernard Raimond, during a news conference yesterday. French Official Chides U.S.  Mr. Raimond noted that the French had been ''ceaselessly'' criticized in American publications for refusing a British request last month to join in punitive measures against Syria that London imposed, charging that Damascus was sponsoring terrorism.\nNow, he said, ''I note with satisfaction that others are now vulnerable, perhaps more vulnerable than us.''\nBritain Foreign Office aides were very cautious in their reaction to the reports, insisting that they did not yet know the full story.\nIn Rome a senior foreign policy official who did not want to be named supported the reported effort, saying that his Government had ''long supported the idea of using diplomacy to attack the roots of terrorism.''"
