Brennan, said Thursday in an interview that the developments showed why the administration strongly believes that terrorism suspects arrested inside the United States should be handled by the traditional system.\n''Both of these cases demonstrate that Miranda was not at all an impediment'' to winning a conviction and eliciting intelligence during an initial interrogation, respectively, Mr. Brennan said. ''The American people should feel reassured that we are handling these cases very effectively as well as consistent with our laws and our values.''\nMr. Brennan's comments came as the Senate considers legislation to require military detention for such cases, part of a bipartisan deal approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee. The administration strongly opposes the measure on the ground that it will tie the hands of counterterrorism professionals, and Mr. Brennan said negotiations over it with lawmakers were continuing.\nConservatives questioned whether either of the developments truly undercuts their arguments in support of the military system.\nThe first development concerned the alleged plot by Iran to kill the Saudi ambassador to the United States. American officials disclosed that ''several hours after his arrest'' they had advised the Iranian-American defendant, Mansour J. Arbabsiar, of his Miranda rights. He waived those rights, as well as a right to be quickly presented to a judge, and spent nearly two weeks providing ''extremely valuable intelligence,'' officials said.\nGiving Miranda warnings to terrorism suspects led to political furor several times in 2010. By contrast, there was little or no criticism of the decision to give the warning to Mr. Arbabsiar.\nRepublican Congressional aides, however, noted that he had been unwittingly dealing with an informant and was under surveillance for months, so it was less likely that he might have any conspirators who were unknown to the government . They also said that because Mr. Arbabsiar is a United States citizen, it was less controversial to read him a Miranda warning.\n''The concern is that the Obama administration has sought to treat foreign terrorists the same way that they would treat U.S. citizens who have committed an act of terrorism by extending additional rights to foreign terrorists, including Miranda rights,'' Representative Lamar Smith said in a statement. Mr. Smith, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, supports sending noncitizen terrorism suspects to the facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\nThe use of the criminal justice system in terrorism cases was routine during the Bush administration. But its use became controversial in December 2009, after Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab tried to blow up a plane with a bomb in his underwear. When the plane landed in Detroit, he confessed extensively for about an hour, and then went into surgery.\nAfter Mr. Abdulmutallab emerged from surgery, officials say, he stopped talking, so they decided to read him his Miranda rights. Mr. Abdulmutallab then did not start cooperating again until several weeks later, which some critics asserted was because of the warning. Among the topics of his interrogation was what role Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born radical Muslim cleric, may have played in recruiting him for the plot; Mr. Awlaki was killed last month in a drone strike.\nThe furor was rekindled in May 2010, after a naturalized American citizen, Faisal Shahzad, was arrested in a failed attempt to blow up his car in Times Square. Interrogators questioned him for several hours before reading him his rights. He waived them and continued cooperating, and eventually pleaded guilty. Still, several Republicans again criticized the decision to give him a warning.\nIn November 2010, the issue flared again after a jury convicted Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, a former Guantanamo detainee who had been brought to the United States, on just one of 285 charges related to his role in the 1998 bombing of embassies in Africa. Republicans said the case showed the civilian system could not be trusted, although Mr. Ghailani was later sentenced to life in prison.\nIn May 2011, two Iraqi immigrants were arrested in Kentucky and charged with terrorism offenses in Iraq. Both waived their Miranda rights and talked to investigators for several days. That trial, which is pending, has been criticized by the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, who contends that it could make his state a terrorist target and that they should be sent to Guantanamo.\nAttorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. issued a guidance memorandum last fall to law enforcement agents in the field encouraging them to use an expansive notion of a ''national security safety exception'' for asking questions of terrorism suspects about any immediate threats to public safety before informing them of their Miranda rights.\nLast month, the judge in Mr. Abdulmutallab's case accepted that notion, refusing to suppress statements he made in the first hour after his arrest. Mr. Brennan called that a ''very powerful ruling'' that ''clearly validated the national security exception.''\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Holder, too, portrayed the outcome of Mr. Abdulmutallab's trial as a vindication for the view that using the criminal justice system in terrorism cases works, saying that ''we will let results, not rhetoric, guide our actions.''\nThat drew criticism from Andrew C. McCarthy, a former federal prosecutor who is now a conservative commentator. In an essay he wrote on the National Review Web site, he said there was never any question that it would be easy to convict Mr. Abdulmutallab. Rather, he said, the issue was whether interrogators got less intelligence from him than if he had been put in military detention.\n''The guilty plea and the virtual certainty of a life sentence for this atrocious terrorist is an excellent result -- one that Mr. Holder is right to celebrate, that we should all celebrate,'' Mr. McCarthy wrote. ''But it is not a victory, much less a dispositive victory, in the political debate over how we should be processing war criminals.''\nBut Mr. Brennan argued that such criticism relied on the ''false premise and assumptions'' that Mr. Abdulmutallab would have talked more had he not been read his Miranda rights and had been put instead in military custody.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTOS: The cases of, from left, Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab and Faisal Shahzad raised issues related to their handling in criminal, rather than military, justice systems.                                                                          \n\nLoad-Date: October 14, 2011"
