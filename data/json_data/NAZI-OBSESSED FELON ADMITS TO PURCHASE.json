    "full text": "Dennis Alan Riggs, a felon who the FBI fears is a potential mass shooter, waived indictment and pleaded guilty by video Wednesday to a federal gun possession charge that will land him in prison.\nRiggs, 51, of Troy Hill, isn't allowed to have guns, but had his partner, a retired Social Security administrative law judge, buy an AR-15 for him.\nThe judge, Karl Alexander, 79, of Grove City, has also pleaded guilty to acting as a straw buyer and is now also a federal felon.\nHe said Riggs, his boyfriend since 1997, had been asking him for years to buy the assault weapon for him. He didn't because he was still a judge, but after he retired finally agreed.\nThe pair went to Ace Sporting Goods in Washington County on Sept. 29, 2018, where Riggs picked the weapon and Alexander bought it, lying on a required federal firearms form.\nRiggs was convicted in 1994 of aggravated assault.\nThe FBI's terrorism unit raided his house Jan. 22.\nThey found the AR-15, six other guns, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, knives, daggers and hundreds of bottles of alcohol.\nThe house was also filled with Nazi banners, flags and pictures of Adolf Hitler in almost every room.\nU.S. District Judge Robert Colville said he'd sentence Riggs in September.\n\nLoad-Date: May 16, 2020"
