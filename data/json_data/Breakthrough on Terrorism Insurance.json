    "full text": "Negotiators representing the White House, Senate Democrats, and House Republicans reached agreement Thursday on long-stalled terrorism insurance legislation.\nThe details of the deal were being drafted at press time.\nThe House and Senate must each vote on the reconciled bill, which would set up a government reinsurance program to back up private insurers in case of new terrorist attacks. President Bush is expected to sign it into law.\nThe agreement was a major breakthrough in the nearly yearlong negotiations between Republicans and Democrats over whether insurers should repay the government for assistance they receive, and whether victims of terrorism should be able to sue employers, building owners, or other private-sector interests for punitive damages.\nHowever, a final vote on the reconciled bill still could be stalled by Senate Republicans, including Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, who have demanded limits on victim lawsuits.\nThe final vote in the Senate could come as early as Wednesday if no senator signals an intention to block it, according to a Senate Democratic aide who did not want to be named. If objections are anticipated, Senate leaders likely would let the House vote first on the measure, the aide said. That would ease the parliamentary path for bringing the measure up in the Senate.\nIt was uncertain at press time if leaders of the House, which adjourned late Wednesday night, might call lawmakers back to Washington for a vote before the Nov. 5 elections.\n\"It's unclear if members will be called back next week solely for considering risk insurance legislation,\" said a House leadership aide, who asked not to be identified. \"If other legislation, like homeland security, is ready, then that might be enough to call members back.\"\nThe House aide cautioned that House Republicans were still reviewing the terms of the agreement Thursday afternoon and that leaders would not make a decision on scheduling a vote until all key lawmakers had signed off on it.\nThe financial services industry has long been calling for Congress to establish a government program. President Bush has said that $15 billion of construction projects have been halted because of a lack of insurance.\nHouse Financial Services Committee Chairman Michael G. Oxley, the lead House negotiator on the bill, said: \"As we continue to deal with the aftermath of 9/11, I expect the legislation to provide some needed certainty for the insurance markets, while removing an important obstacle that now stands in the way of development projects across the nation.\"\n \nCopyright 2002 Thomson Media.
