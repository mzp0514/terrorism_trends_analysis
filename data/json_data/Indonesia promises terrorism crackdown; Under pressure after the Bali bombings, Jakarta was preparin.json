All the nations should be united to fight against terrorism.\"\nBaasyir, 64, a cleric who runs an Islamic school, denies that Jemaah Islamiyah exists or that the Bali bombing was linked to al-Qaeda. He has said repeatedly that the blast was a plot by the United States to discredit Islam.\nPolice are expected to interrogate the cleric today. Yesterday, police grilled another Islamic militant, al Habib Muhammad Rizieq, the head of the Front Pembela Islam. Several of his followers went on trial yesterday for violent attacks on nightclubs, liquor stores and other businesses that violate the strict codes of Islam.\nIn what may be another sign of a government crackdown, the lawyer for the Laskar Jihad, a Muslim militia group that has sent members to fight Christians in the Maluku islands and elsewhere in Indonesia, said Tuesday that the group had disbanded. About 1,200 Laskar Jihad members were being withdrawn from the war-torn area, according to local news reports.\nDetails of the planned emergency decree have not been disclosed, but it would give the government a stronger hand in dealing with militants. The decree also would allow Megawati to circumvent Indonesia's parliament, where proposed antiterrorism legislation has languished for months.\nCritics fear the legislation would be a step toward resurrecting the draconian internal security act that the former authoritarian Suharto regime used to jail its critics. Similar internal security acts in Singapore and Malaysia have been used in the last year to detain without trial dozens of suspected Jemaah Islamiyah members.\nAnnouncement of the emergency decree was not the only indication of a shift in the government's stance.\nAustralian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, after meeting with Hassan, his Indonesian counterpart, said he was \"very optimistic about the degree of cooperation unfolding between Indonesia and Australia.\"\nDowner told CNN he believed the Indonesian government now realized the need for a tougher stand against terrorism and had agreed to create an investigative team with Australia to probe the Bali bombing. Many of those killed in the blast were vacationing Australians.\nContact Michael Dorgan at mdorgan@krwashington.com.  \n\nLoad-Date: October 17, 2002"
