    "full text": "I agree with U.S. Attorney Patrick Meehan that we need to leave the rhetoric behind and focus on the facts of the Patriot Act (\"Patriot Act: Keep it and all its tools,\" Commentary Page, June 10).\nAs a former member of Congress who voted for the act in 2001, I believe much of it is necessary to provide law enforcement with resources needed to defeat terrorism.\nHowever, several provisions go beyond that mission and infringe on the rights of ordinary Americans in ways that raise serious constitutional concerns. The majority in Congress recognized these concerns when they passed the legislation, making certain that the most extraordinary provisions would be subject to congressional review and expire in December.\nThe administration says the act has been successful but refuses to tell the public how the most-controversial provisions have been used, how many U.S. citizens have had their records turned over to the government through Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act orders or FBI letters, how many terrorism versus non-terrorism sneak-and-peek searches have occurred, how many actual terrorism crime prosecutions there have really been, and even in some instances the number of times a particular provision has been used. So why are they pushing for legislation to expand the act and give the FBI authority to write and approve its own administrative subpoenas? That would be a blatant disregard for our Constitution's fundamental checks and balances, and one that no American should support.\nBob Barr\nChairman\nPatriots to Restore Checks and Balances\nAtlanta\n\nLoad-Date: July 11, 2005"
