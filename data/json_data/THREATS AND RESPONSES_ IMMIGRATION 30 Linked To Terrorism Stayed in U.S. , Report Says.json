The investigators said bureau agents and immigration officials had repeatedly failed to investigate or find the foreign visitors and warned that they might still be in the country. \n Officials at the F.B.I. disputed the findings, saying they had investigated all visitors linked with terrorism to determine whether they posed a threat. Officials from the Department of Homeland Security said they had investigated 10 of the 30 people in question and had not received information on the others.\nBut the investigators and members of Congress, who listened today to testimony from the bureau and immigration officials at a House hearing on national security, said they were somewhat doubtful about the accuracy of what they heard. They said F.B.I. officials, who were repeatedly consulted by the accounting office, had never claimed to have cleared the foreign visitors until today.\nThe problems cited in the Congressional investigative report were similar to those uncovered in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. It was revealed then that the C.I.A. had failed to notify other agencies in time that at least two of the hijackers who had entered the country should have been placed on a watch list.\nRepresentative Christopher Shays, Republican of Connecticut, called the new findings \"alarming.\" Mr. Shays said he wanted to believe the sworn testimony from the F.B.I. but said he was directing his staff to consult with senior officials from the Justice Department to make sure.\n\"It leaves a bad taste in my mouth,\" Mr. Shays, the chairman of the national security subcommittee, said of the bureau's testimony. \"Something doesn't add up. I hope there's not an element of spin here.\"\nIn the report, the G.A.O. examined 240 cases in which the State Department revoked tourism or business visas because of terrorism concerns during the last four months of 2002.\nAll but one of the 30 visitors in question had already entered the country by the time the State Department identified them as potential security risks and revoked their visas. Most of the visitors entered the country last year, but others entered in previous years.\nThe Congressional investigators said they found repeated delays and mistakes in information sharing when the State Department tried to pass on critical details about the visitors who were deemed to be security risks.\nThe investigators said it took 12 days on average for a cable from the State Department to reach immigration officials, who might have investigated the whereabouts of the visitors in question.\nIn 43 of the 240 cases investigated, immigration officials said they were never told to question the visitors. When they received the data, the immigration officials entered incorrect information into their computers in 21 cases.\nAnd the State Department's information was often so incomplete -- lacking dates of birth or passport numbers -- that the F.B.I. rarely checked the names against its terrorist watch list, the report said. The bureau said State Department officials did not tell them that people with revoked visas could be \"possible terrorists.\"\nInvestigators said the systemic weaknesses uncovered during the investigation \"increase the possibility of a suspected terrorist entering or remaining in the United States.\" Officials said that some of the visitors in question might have already left the country but that they had been unable to find evidence of their leaving.\nAt the hearing, members of Congress asked pointed questions about how the communication problems were being resolved. They also expressed concern that immigration officials said they could not deport those visitors whose visas were revoked once they had arrived.\nThe officials said they were meeting to determine whether changes could be made in existing regulations to ensure that such visitors could be deported if necessary in the future.\nA senior official from the State Department testified that the communication problems identified had been resolved, allowing for immediate notification when visas had been revoked.      \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: June 19, 2003"
