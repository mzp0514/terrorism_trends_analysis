    "full text": "The status of Senate hearings into the Centennial Olympic Park bombing and the FBI's handling of the Richard Jewell investigation is in doubt because of a committee shake-up involving Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.).\nSpecter chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on terrorism and presided last month over the first of what were to be several hearings devoted to the bombing. But under new rules adopted by Republicans in the Senate, Specter is barred from chairing a subcommittee like the one on terrorism if he also chairs a full committee.\nSpecter will be named the new chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee when Congress officially convenes today. Though he will remain on the Judiciary Committee, he will be ineligible to continue as chairman of the terrorism subcommittee.\nThere are no guarantees that the Senate Judiciary Committee and its chairman, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), will even re-create the terrorism subcommittee in the 105th Congress.\nAll subcommittees cease to exist with the close of the old Congress. A decision on which subcommittees will be revived in the new Congress is expected in the next several weeks.\n\"The best you can say is that it's up in the air right now,\" said Jeanne Lopatto, spokeswoman for the Judiciary Committee.\nEven if the terrorism subcommittee returns in the new Congress, there are no assurances that the new chairman will want to pursue the bombing investigation with the same enthusiasm as Specter, who also conducted hearings into the FBI standoff at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, and made oversight of the FBI a high priority.\nJohn Ullyot, Specter's spokesman, said the senator will urge Hatch to call hearings into the park bombing as chairman of the entire committee.\n\nLoad-Date: January 8, 1997"
