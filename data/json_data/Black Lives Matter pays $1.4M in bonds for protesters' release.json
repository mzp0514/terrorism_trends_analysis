He denies wrongdoing.\nAdam Warner Hayhurst, Desha Lee Dixon and James Lovell Holt, who are charged with rioting, also were released. The trio is accused of violent acts during racial justice protests on May 31.\nThe individual bail for Hayhurst and Dixon separately was $300,000, while Holt's was $50,000, reduced from $300,000.\nThe nonprofit National Bail Fund Network contributed significantly to the bonds Black Lives Matter in Oklahoma City paid to bail out the protesters.\n\"This is what we do. The National Bail Fund Network makes sure there's support for community bail funds across the country,\" Director Pilar Weiss said.\nThe nonprofit has had a flood of donations since the May 25 killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man who died pleading for air after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against Floyd's neck for nearly eight minutes. Floyd's death catalyzed national and global protests against systematic racism and police brutality against Black people.\nFor copyright information, check with the distributor of this item, The Oklahoman.\n\nLoad-Date: July 13, 2020"
