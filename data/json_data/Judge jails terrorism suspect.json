    "full text": "WASHINGTON (AP) - A Palestinian who authorities say was second-in-command of a violent terrorist group will remain in jail pending trial for a fatal 1982 bombing of an American jetliner, a federal judge ruled Monday.\nA federal prosecutor argued that Mohammed Rashid is dangerous and skilled in eluding law enforcement, noting he once escaped from a Turkish prison and has used fake passports from several countries.\n\"He has no ties to this country\" and would likely flee overseas if released, Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Walutes said during a brief hearing before U.S. District Judge Aubrey Robinson.\nRashid, 51, was whisked out of Egypt earlier this month and brought to Washington to face terrorism charges. He pleaded innocent June 3 in a bombing that killed a 16-year-old Japanese boy and injured 15 other passengers on an international Pan Am flight in August 1982.\nAn 11-year-old U.S. indictment contends Rashid and his wife planted a bomb under a seat cushion on the Boeing 747. The couple, with their young child in tow, set the timer to explode on a flight from Japan to Hawaii and then got off the plane in Tokyo.\nThe explosion tore a 3-foot hole in the jet's cabin, Walutes said. If the bomb had been placed elsewhere, he said, \"The entire plane could have come down over the Pacific.\"\n\nLoad-Date: June 18, 1998"
