    "full text": "The International League for Human Rights today urged the British Government to consider immediate revision of Northern Ireland's emergency laws for the interrogation and trial of suspected terrorists.\nThe appeal was prompted by a study that warned of acceptance of the measures imposed by Britain in 1973 in an attempt to control rising political tension.\nInternational League of Human Rights urges Britain to revise laws on interrogation and trial of suspected terroristsUnder these laws, alleged terrorists are subject to long interrogations and trial without jury.\nPoverty and unemployment in Roman Catholic communities were cited in the study as a cause of the violence in Northern Ireland. Efforts to end the violence between Protestants, who constitute two-thirds of the population, and Catholics have been hampered by terrorism.\nThe study, ''Ten Years On in Northern Ireland: The Legal Control of Political Violence,'' recommended the following:\n- A law restricting interrogation of suspected terrorists to one hour at a time and no more than four hours a day.\n- Disciplinary action against police officers who extract confessions.\n- A ban on nighttime searches of homes without a warrant.  The study concluded that there is ''little alternative'' for Britain's policy of involvement in Northern Ireland until ''some more stable political settlement can be achieved.''"
