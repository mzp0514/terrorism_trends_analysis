    "full text": "Iraqi security forces on Sunday battled gunmen who detonated a car bomb before blasting their way into a government compound and killing seven policemen in a one-time Sunni insurgent hotbed, police and local government officials said.\nThe three-hour standoff between Shiite-dominated security forces and suspected Sunni insurgents in the Anbar province capital of Ramadi, 70 miles  west of Baghdad, marked the first serious gunbattle for Iraqi forces against insurgents  since the U.S. military completed its withdrawal last month.\nViolence has surged since U.S.  troops left, and Iraq was plunged into a political crisis after the Shiite-dominated government charged Sunni Vice President Tareq al-Hashemi with running death squads, issuing an arrest warrant against him.\nOn Sunday, a court in Baghdad ruled that al-Hashemi must stand trial on terror charges in Baghdad, rejecting his request to be tried in the ethnically mixed city of  Kirkuk. He has fled to the autonomous Kurdish region, out of reach of authorities in Baghdad.\nHe said he believes he could get a fair trial in Kirkuk but would be in danger in Baghdad.\nAl-Hashemi's Iraqiya party  has been boycotting parliament and Cabinet sessions since last month to protest what it sees as efforts by Shiite Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to consolidate power, particularly over state security forces.\nThe sectarian crisis in the government and the spike in attacks, such as a bombing Saturday that killed more than 50 pilgrims during a Shiite procession,  has raised concerns Iraq could return to sectarian bloodshed that killed tens of thousands of civilians after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion and brought the country to the brink of civil war just a few years ago.\nOn Sunday morning, five gunmen wearing military uniforms and explosive-rigged vests stormed a compound in Ramadi,  police officials said.\nThe compound houses Ramadi police headquarters and several federal security agencies, including an anti-terrorism police task force and a detention facility where terrorism suspects are interrogated.\nBefore reaching the compound in central Ramadi, the gunmen set off an explosives-filled car in the eastern part of the city, in an apparent effort to draw security personnel from the heavily guarded government area, according to an Anbar government official.\nComrades of the attackers were being held there on suspicion of involvement in terror attacks.\nOne policeman was killed and three others were injured in the blast before the standoff, police and health officials said.\nThe officials spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters.\nSadoun Obaid al-Jumaily, deputy president of the Anbar Provincial Council had a slightly different account of Sunday's assault. He said  that the five gunmen drove to the entrance of the compound. Four got out of the car and clashed with the police.\nSecurity forces killed two attackers, and two managed to get into the building where the suspected insurgents were  held.\nThe fifth attacker was killed in the blast of the explosives-packed car aimed at killing police and army troops, who were rushing to the compound to fight the gunmen, al-Jumaily said.\nSix policemen were killed in the gunfight and 13 others were wounded, al-Jumaily said. \n\nLoad-Date: January 16, 2012"
