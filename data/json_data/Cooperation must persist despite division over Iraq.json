    "full text": "The United States and several European countries obviously were at odds over how Iraq and Saddam Hussein should be handled. However, it's reassuring to see greater agreement on the threat posed by terrorism.\nIt is important that the rift over Iraq not be allowed to prevent a unified front against the continued threat from the al-Qaida terrorism network. Such cooperation is essential to prevent al-Qaida from finding a safe haven or from exploiting security weaknesses in one country to launch an attack on another.\nA joint statement from the Group of Eight - Japan, Britain, Canada, France, German, Italy, Russia and the United States - warned that \"terrorism continues to present both a pervasive and global threat to our societies.\"\nNext month's G8 summit will be hosted by France, a country with which the United States sharply disagreed over Iraq. However, French Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy said, \"Those disagreements are real, but that does not necessitate disaccord on the fight against terrorism.\"\nWhile having the G8 ministers say, \"The threat from the al-Qaida network remains serious\" is hardly comforting, having them commit to working together to address that threat is encouraging.\nAmong tasks on which the countries have pledged to work together is developing methods to combat forgery of passports and other travel documents. Better sharing of intelligence information among countries also is a goal.\nThere are likely to be disagreements along the way in the fight against terrorism. But these disagreements must not be allowed to create a gap that terrorists can use to their advantage.\n\nLoad-Date: May 21, 2003"
