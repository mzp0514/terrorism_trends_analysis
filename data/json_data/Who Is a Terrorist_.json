    "full text": "To the Editor:\n Re ''Cuban Exile Could Test the U.S. Definition of Terrorist'' (front page, May 9):\n The fact that Luis Posada Carriles is now seeking asylum in the United States shows the importance of a common international posture on terrorism. \n Although feted by some as a freedom fighter, Mr. Posada is charged with the 1976 bombing of a Cuban civilian airliner that killed a good portion of the Cuban Pan American Games team just four years after the massacre at the Munich Olympics.\n The call, from Kofi Annan, United Nations secretary general, for a basic definition of terrorism provides a sound human rights framework to distinguish the acceptable acts of the freedom fighter or national liberation movement from acts of terrorism that can never be tolerated. \n Mr. Annan supports a comprehensive treaty to define acts as terrorism that are intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians, with the intent to intimidate others and pressure governments. \n This would protect civilians and make clear that whatever the cause, a freedom fighter who guns down civilians will be brought to justice for terrorism, not harbored, given a new identity, redeployed or helped to find a safe haven in another country.\n\nMichael McClintock\nDirector of Program\nHuman Rights First\nNew York, May 9, 2005\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: May 17, 2005"
