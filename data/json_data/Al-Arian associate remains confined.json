Al-Najjar spent more than four years behind bars before he was deported.\nMcCullough acknowledged Hammoudeh's acquittal but said immigration officials don't agree with the jury's unanimous decision.\n\"Beyond saying that, I can't comment because I'm trying to understand this myself,\" she said.\nOn Feb. 20, Hammoudeh will have been in prison for three years. He was held without bail until the terrorism trial was finished in early December.\nWhen the jury acquitted Hammoudeh, U.S. District Judge James S. Moody Jr. ordered him released.\nBut immigration officials immediately rearrested him.\n\"I am so very frustrated,\" Hammoudeh, 45, and the father of six children, told the St. Petersburg Times.\nBefore the six-month terrorism trial began in June, Hammoudeh and his wife, Nadia, pleaded guilty to income tax evasion for not paying $8,027 in taxes over 11 years. Hammoudeh agreed to plead guilty in exchange for probation until he and his wife are deported.\nSteve Crawford, Hammoudeh's attorney for the tax case, called it \"a blatant attempt by prosecutors to pressure him to give information on Al-Arian\" for the terrorism case.\nA onetime doctoral student at the University of South Florida and a private school teacher, Hammoudeh insisted he \"had nothing to give\" on Al-Arian.\nOn Wednesday, Hammoudeh attorney Stephen Bernstein stood in a makeshift courtroom in Bradenton and asked U.S Immigration Judge Gail Padgett to release Hammoudeh because his plea agreement in the tax evasion case stated he was \"not to have jail time.\"\nHammoudeh, in drab prison blues, sat next to Bernstein. His wife and two oldest daughters sat behind them, hoping to finally take him home to Temple Terrace.\nPadgett told Bernstein: \"The immigration court does not have jurisdiction to release him.\"\nBernstein's reply: \"Then, who does?\"\nPadgett's response: \"I don't know. All I know for sure is it's not my jurisdiction. But whose it is, I am not really sure.\"\nIt might be up to immigration supervisor David Wing, Padgett suggested. But Bernstein said he already had talked to Wing, who said \"he had no discretion.\" Padgett concluded that Wing \"may be right because this is an unusual case.\"\nIn the hallway after the hearing, Bernstein said: \"The path to getting Sameeh Hammoudeh released is like a maze. Every time you make a turn there's another block.\"\nBernstein said Wednesday he will next go to Moody. \"Surely, Moody has the power to do something,\" he said.\nBut McCullough said immigration officials are responsible, not the federal court.\nAlso Wednesday, Moody denied an acquittal request from Al-Arian in the terrorism case. Al-Arian, Hammoudeh and two other defendants were charged with raising money for the violent acts of Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Israel and the Occupied Territories.\nAl-Arian was acquitted on eight counts and the jury hung on nine counts.\nOn Hammoudeh's legal limbo, Al-Arian's attorney Bill Moffitt said, \"A man who's acquitted can't find his way out of prison? Welcome to the war against terrorism.\"\nTimes staff writer Jennifer Liberto contributed to this story.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO; PHOTO, CHRIS ZUPPA\nSameeh Hammoudeh; Sameeh Hammoudeh's wife, Nadia Hammoudeh, and their two daughters, Doaa Hammoudeh and Weeam Hammoudeh, gather after the immigration hearing in Bradenton.\n\nLoad-Date: January 19, 2006"
