That treaty, which provides for a common European currency and increased cooperation on foreign and security policy, will also go into effect next January if all 12 members ratify it this year. The House of Commons is expected to give its approval next week.\nAfter the end of the year, customs declarations and inspections will no longer be carried out at entry points on travelers coming from other community countries, even in Britain.\nBut identity checks will continue, at least here. British officials say they are unwilling to rely on the thoroughness of entry controls in places like Athens or Italy to keep terrorists out. As things are, they carry out random ID checks on passengers arriving in London from Belfast, which is British territory.\nAt all British ports and airports, arriving travelers follow separate lines for \"E.C. passport holders\" and \"all others,\" and apparently will continue to be treated this way.\n\nLoad-Date: May 22, 1992"
