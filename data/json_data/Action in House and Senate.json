Bush a bill allowing military commissions to prosecute terrorism suspects with legislation that also spells out violations of the Geneva Conventions.\nThe Senate sent Bush a $448 billion defense spending bill that includes $70 billion for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nThe House and Senate passed and sent to Bush a nearly $35 billion homeland security spending bill that included $1.2 billion for increased border fencing to discourage illegal immigration.\nSenate Democrats blocked a final vote on sending Bush a bill that would make it a crime for anyone but a parent to take a girl across state lines to obtain an abortion. The bill was passed Tuesday by the House.\nThe Senate sent to Bush a bill to build 700 miles of new fencing along the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border. The House passed this bill two weeks ago.\nWhat Congress didn't do:\nThe House and Senate could not reconcile their differences over legislation allowing the warrantless wiretapping of terrorism suspects in time to deliver a bill before the election.\nSpending bills for annually funded government programs other than defense and security remained unfinished.\nCongress did not renew a host of tax breaks that expired at the end of last year, including deductions for tuition, teachers' classroom expenses and state and local sales taxes, as well as a research and development credit for businesses.\nEfforts to merge different House and Senate bills expanding offshore drilling failed.\nThe House and Senate responded to lobbying scandals by passing ethics bills, but they couldn't reconcile their differences and send an overall measure to the White House for signing.\n\nLoad-Date: September 30, 2006"
