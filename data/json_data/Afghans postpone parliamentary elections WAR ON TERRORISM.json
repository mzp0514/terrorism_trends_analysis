    "full text": "KABUL, AFGHANISTAN - The Afghan government postponed parliamentart elections for four months on Sunday, citing security concerns, logistical problems and a lack of enough money from the country's international partners to pay for them.\nThe U.S. and its allies urged the Afghans to use the time to reform the electoral system to avoid a repeat of last year's fraud-marred election, which undercut international support for President Hamid Karzai and threatened the White House's strategy for reversing the tide of the war.\nAnother flawed balloting would make it difficult for Western leaders to rally support for the war among their own constituencies as U.S. and NATO casualties rise. Three American service members were killed Sunday in two separate bombings in southern Afghanistan.\nThat brings to 25 the number of American deaths in Afghanistan so far this month, compared with 14 for the whole of January last year.\nThe Independent Election Commission, whose head is appointed by Karzai, said it needed about $50 million from the international community to pay for the parliamentary election, budgeted to cost $120 million.\nThat money has not come through in time to hold the vote as planned on May 22, according to commissioner Fazel Ahmed Manawi. He also attributed the delay to security concerns, logistical challenges and the need to improve the election process.\nThe vote instead will be held on Sept. 18, Manawi said.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n GRAPHIC - U.S. MILITARY WAR DEATHS | AP \n\nLoad-Date: January 30, 2010"
