The administration has briefed some about the president's plan, officials said.\nLast year, Mr. Trump removed the U.S. from another major international arms-control agreement with Russia, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which dates back to 1987.\nMichigan flooding declared emergency\nMany Central Michigan residents remained cut off from their homes Thursday even as floodwaters receded, with senior citizens among the scores of people staying in shelters after flooding overwhelmed two dams, submerged homes and washed out roads.\nPresident Donald Trump, who was visiting a Michigan Ford production plant, signed an emergency declaration authorizing the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate relief efforts.\nAt Midland High School, 90% of people who slept in the school's gym were senior citizens, said shelter coordinator Jerry Wasserman. He said extra precautions were in place due to the combination of the guests' ages and the coronavirus pandemic.\n\"We had to deal with COVID and then deal with their angst of what's happened to their house and their pets and all this,\" Mr. Wasserman said Thursday.\nMuch of the area remained underwater, including in Midland, the headquarters of Dow Chemical Co. And floodwaters continued to threaten downstream communities.\nIt could be days before the full scope of damage can be assessed, officials said. No flood-related deaths or injuries have been reported.\nFBI: Texas shooting is 'terrorism-related'\nA shooting at a Texas naval air station that wounded a sailor and killed the gunman early Thursday was being investigated as \"terrorism-related,\" the FBI said, but divulged few details as to why.\nThe suspect was identified as Adam Alsahli, of Corpus Christi, according to three officials familiar with the investigation who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\nFBI Supervisory Senior Resident Agent Leah Greeves said at a news conference that investigators were working to determine whether a second person of interest was at large but did not elaborate. She also would not discuss a potential motive or specify what led investigators to believe the shooting was related to terrorism.\nThe injured sailor was discharged from a hospital where she was treated for minor injuries, according to a statement from the command.\n\nLoad-Date: May 22, 2020"
