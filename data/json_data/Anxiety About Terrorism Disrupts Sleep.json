Get aerobic exercise during the day, but not close to bedtime. Start winding down at least an hour before going to sleep, avoiding news reports about the terrorist attacks or stimulating movies, TV shows and books.\nBecause worries can keep people from falling asleep, Kohler teaches a technique that helps his patients let go.\n\"A half-hour before going to bed, make a list of everything that worries you, then fold it, put it away and do something relaxing,\" he said.\n\"My patients tell me this works.\"\n\nLoad-Date: September 24, 2001"
