    "full text": "There’s another kind of terrorism besides ISIS. It’s not in Paris. It’s here and we must do something about it. It is family terrorism. Remember the recent heartbreaking trials in McLean County concerning very young children beaten to death or drowned by lethal parents or caregivers? \nFor American children under four, the third-leading cause of death is murder — a majority at the hands of a parent or caregiver. Family terrorism. Had these little children lived, they might have become violent adults, even criminals —perhaps even joining ISIS. They might also have inflicted a similar childhood on any children of their own. \nUnchecked, family terrorism mushrooms into generational violence. Police and prisons can do little to stop it. What have we done about it locally? Not enough. Just last month, our Children’s Home + Aid was forced to cut another Healthy Start employee, leaving 25 young, at-risk families without help. \nThis is a terrible tragedy. Why? Because Healthy Start— not Head Start, Healthy Start — really works. Mentors visit at-risk parents and teach child care from birth to age five. The pilot project in Hawaii of 241 families with abuse/neglect histories had no repeat cases of abuse and only four of neglect. Think of that! \nHealthy Start not only protects infants and small children, it helps keep them from having a criminal future. It’s a no-brainer. Your support is needed now to restore this critical service.  \nBarbara Findley Stuart  \nNormal \n\nLoad-Date: July 15, 2021"
