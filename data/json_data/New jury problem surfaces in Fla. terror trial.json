    "full text": "MIAMI (AP) - A new jury problem surfaced Friday in the terrorism conspiracy trial of six men when panel members asked a federal judge to remove a juror because she supposedly refused to deliberate.\nA few hours after an ill juror was replaced, a note signed by the jury foreman in the \"Liberty City Six\" case said a female juror \"refuses to engage in discussions based on the evidence or the law\" and that this could be \"unfair to the defendants,\" according to U.S. District Judge Joan Lenard. The note said the juror was disruptive and had made comments offensive to others.\n\"Please help us, judge,\" the note said, adding the juror \"feels deliberating is a waste of time.\"\nThe juror problems were only the latest difficulty in the case, which has gone through two mistrials when earlier juries were unable to agree on verdicts. This third trial has taken over two months and comes nearly three years after the six men were arrested in June 2006.\nThe six are charged with conspiring with al-Qaida to destroy Chicago's 110-story Sears Tower and bomb FBI offices around the country. The plan never got beyond the discussion stage and the group never obtained any weaponry or explosives necessary for such attacks.\nThe group's leader, 35-year-old Narseal Batiste, testified that he only went along with terrorism discussions because he wanted money from an FBI informant posing as an al-Qaida emissary. Defense attorney also accused the FBI of orchestrating the entire fictitious case to make career-enhancing terrorism arrests.\nThe group became known by the name of their neighborhood of Liberty City, an impoverished area of Miami.\n\nLoad-Date: May 4, 2009"
