Hafiz Saeed was taken into custody Wednesday while travelling to the eastern city of Gujranwala, where he appeared before a judge on terror finance charges, according to a Pakistani counterterrorism spokesman.\nSaeed, a UN-designated terrorist on whom the U.S. has placed a $10 million bounty, was travelling to Gujranwala from Lahore to get pre-arrest bail in terror financing cases registered against him there when he was arrested, said a CTD official.\nAmazon Workers Plan to Strike on Prime Day\nIn October of 2018, Amazon announced that it would pay all workers in the United States at least $15/hour within a month. Unfortunately, this bombastic new Prime Day deal only applies if you've never watched anything on Prime Video before.\nOn Tuesday, Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Mr. Trump's invitation to the Pakistani premier reflected the \"importance of the relationship for both sides\".\nSaeed founded the Lashkar-e-Taiba group, which was blamed for theMumbai attacks that killed 166 people.\nHafiz Saeed was listed under UN Security Council Resolution 1267 in December 2008. \"One court orders his arrest, another frees him\", said the official, who has close knowledge of diplomatic issues with Pakistan.\nIn recent months, the government also took over schools, mosques, seminaries and all properties linked to Saeed's charities and froze their assets.\nBorn in 1948, Hafiz Saeed along with his family started migrating from East Punjab and reached Pakistan in around four months in the autumn of 1947. LeT is a terrorist group designated by the United Nations. Hence, they committed multiple offences of terrorism financing & money laundering under Anti Terrorism Act 1997. Earlier, Saeed was under house arrest. Pakistan said Saeed had been cleared by its courts and sought more eveidence from India.\n\nLoad-Date: July 18, 2019"
