    "full text": "A LAWYER FOR Saudi Arabia urged a judge to toss a lawsuit filed by the families of 9/11 victims, arguing there's no evidence that the kingdom was complicit in the terror attack.\nAttorney Michael Kellogg said lawyers for the Sept. 11 families submitted 4,000 pages of materials as part of the suit accusing Saudi Arabia of providing material support to Al Qaeda ahead of the terror attacks.\n\"But there are no significant facts or evidence in the materials,\" Kellogg, who represents Saudi Arabia, said Thursday in Manhattan Federal Court.\nThe families of hundreds of 9/11 victims filed the suit in March - six months after Congress passed the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. The legislation, which was passed over a veto by former President Barack Obama, opened the door for Americans to sue countries that support terrorism.\nSean Carter, a lawyer for one of the plaintiffs, said there's evidence that Saudi rulers funded certain charities despite knowing that they funneled money to Al Qaeda.\nJudge George Daniels pushed back.\n\"Would that make Saudi Arabia liable for all other terrorist attacks that Al Qaeda is involved in simply because some of the money came from Saudi Arabia?\" he asked.\nFifteen of the 19 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nNLVL\n\nLoad-Date: January 19, 2018"
