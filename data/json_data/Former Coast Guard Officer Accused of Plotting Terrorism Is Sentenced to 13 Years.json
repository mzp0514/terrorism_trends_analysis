Hazel of United States District Court in Maryland sentenced Mr. Hasson, 50, to 160 months in federal prison followed by four years of supervised release.\nFederal prosecutors had asked that Mr. Hasson be sentenced to 25 years in prison. In a court filing, they said that Mr. Hasson was inspired by racist murderers, stockpiled assault weapons, studied violence and intended to “exact retribution on minorities and those he considered traitors.”\nProsecutors said that Mr. Hasson had identified as a white nationalist for more than 30 years and had, in writing, advocated “focused violence” in order to establish a white homeland.\n“Christopher Hasson intended to inflict violence on the basis of his racist and hateful beliefs,” Robert K. Hur, the United States attorney in Maryland, said in a statement Friday. “As long as violent extremists take steps to harm innocent people, we will continue to use all of the tools we have to prevent and deter them.”\nMr. Hasson’s lawyer, Elizabeth G. Oyer, did not immediately respond to messages on Friday. In a court filing, she had asked that Mr. Hasson, who has been detained since his arrest nearly a year ago, be sentenced to time served followed by three years of supervised release.\nMs. Oyer described Mr. Hasson as a decorated member of the Coast Guard and a devoted father and husband with no prior criminal history.\nShe said that, like many Americans, Mr. Hasson had gone through a difficult time in midlife and had become addicted to opioids. His crimes, she wrote, arose from his addiction.\nMr. Hasson had acknowledged in court filings that from at least March 2016 to early February 2019, he ordered at least 4,650 pills of Tramadol, an opioid, and consumed the vast majority of them, usually daily, while working at Coast Guard headquarters in Washington.\n“Mr. Hasson is deeply ashamed of his conduct,” Ms. Oyer wrote. “He regrets that he was too ashamed to seek help with his addiction. He is sincerely remorseful for the damage he has done to his personal and Coast Guard families. He is also remorseful for the alarm he caused his fellow citizens.”\nMs. Oyer, however, decried the labeling of Mr. Hasson by prosecutors as a “domestic terrorist” and a racist, noting that he was not charged with any terrorism-related offenses.\n“Mr. Hasson’s reputation is destroyed,” Ms. Oyer wrote. “His career is all but over. He is nationally notorious as a pariah.”\nThe Coast Guard said Friday that it had terminated any rights, benefits and retirement pay that Mr. Hasson would otherwise have been entitled to because of his service.\n“Any semblance of hate, bigotry or advocacy of violence has no place in our Coast Guard,” Adm. Karl Schultz, commandant of the Coast Guard, said in a statement. “This includes involvement with white supremacist or extremist groups of any type.”\nPHOTO: Firearms and ammunition that belonged to Christopher Paul Hasson, a former Coast Guard lieutenant.
