    "full text": "The U.N. terrorism committee has found no evidence linking Iraq to al-Qaida and did not investigate claims by President George W. Bush's administration of such ties, officials said Thursday.\nThe terrorism committee has just completed a draft report charting efforts by countries to track and shut down Osama bin Laden's operations.\nThe report notes success in the war on terrorism stemming from the arrests of some top al-Qaida figures.\nBut it also notes the group has been able to reconstitute support and benefit from loopholes to continue acts of terrorism worldwide.\nNowhere in the 42-page draft is there any mention of Iraq or claims that it served as a safe haven for al-Qaida.\nThe committee first heard of alleged ties during Secretary of State Colin Powell's February presentation to the Security Council.\n\"It had never come to our knowledge before Powell's speech and we never received any information from the United States for us to even follow-up on,\" said Abaza Hassan, a committee investigator.\nU.S. diplomats said Powell had laid out all the evidence to the council.\n\"We know that Iraq provided some training to al-Qaida in chemical weapons development, and we also know there were clear contacts between them that can be documented,\" said Richard Grenell, spokesman for the U.S. mission here.\nPowell insisted in his presentation that Saddam Hussein's government was allowing a senior al-Qaida member named Abu Musab Zarqawi to operate from Baghdad. Zarqawi has been indicted in the murder of a U.S. diplomat in Jordan on Oct. 28.\nThe alleged connections were cited by the administration as one of the key reasons for going after Saddam.\nBut the committee saw no need to investigate Zarqawi's movements.\n\nNotes\n\nPAGE 2\n\nLoad-Date: June 28, 2003"
