    "full text": "The FBI Student Academy is returning to UMKC in the fall, giving more students the chance to learn from real FBI agents. This year, discussions will cover everything from cyber-crimes to violent gangs.\nThe first seminar is on Sept. 11 and will focus on Domestic Terrorism. The FBI will discuss details of a specific case with students, followed by a question and answer segment.\nThe FBI Student Academy is perfect for students who are interested in working in law enforcement and want to learn more about what it is like to be in the field.\n\"Students interested in a career in law enforcement could benefit by learning more about the FBI in general,\" said Criminal Justice and Criminology Professor Lindsey Arbuthnot Clancey. \"The FBI is law enforcement at the federal level, so hearing from a special agent is a great way to learn about careers in the field.\"\nThe steering committee urges students from all backgrounds to attend the sessions. They hope the seminars will be attended by any students that are interested at all in the FBI or other law enforcement, regardless of their majors.\n\"All students should consider attending the FBI Student Academy,\" said Arbuthnot Clancey. \"We are so lucky to have these presentations take place on-campus and completely free of charge.\"\nThe seminar schedule for the 2018-19 academic year is set to have eight sessions, with students who attend at least six sessions to receive an official certificate of completion at the final seminar.\nkbv5g8@mail.umkc.edu\n\nLoad-Date: August 30, 2018"
