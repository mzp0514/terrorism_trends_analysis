David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the committee's senior Democrat, said a preliminary inquiry by bipartisan staffers had found news reports were credible that the Pentagon's \"Office of Special Plans\" had failed to share some intelligence with regular intelligence agencies and had provided information directly to Bush that was not verified through proper channels.\nMeanwhile, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D., Calif.) introduced legislation that would establish an independent commission to examine the intelligence the Bush administration used in portraying Hussein as a threat to U.S. security. The proposal appeared unlikely to pass over Republican opposition.\nThe House and Senate intelligence committees are conducting closed-door reviews.\nAdministration officials said yesterday that the discovery in Iraq of 12-year-old buried components for a centrifuge that could be used to purify uranium for a nuclear weapon helps make their case. They also rebuffed suggestions that two mobile labs that the CIA says were biological-weapons production plants might have been constructed for other purposes.\nOn the terrorism issue, administration spokesmen repeated their position that Iraq had ties with al-Qaeda.\nA U.S. official said intelligence agencies had received new information since Hussein's overthrow in April of past cooperation between his regime and the terrorist network.\n\"We have received additional information that tells us our reasons for concern were well-founded,\" said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the information is classified. He declined to elaborate.\nOther knowledgeable officials said that intelligence suggesting such a link was tenuous at best, and that while some al-Qaeda associates might have been in Iraq, there was no evidence of active cooperation in carrying out terrorist operations.\n\"The bottom line is that most of what the administration put out about Saddam making common cause with al-Qaeda was politics, not intelligence,\" said a defense official who requested anonymity.\nContact reporter Warren Strobel at 202-383-6033 or wstrobel@krwashington.com.  \n\nLoad-Date: August 1, 2005"
