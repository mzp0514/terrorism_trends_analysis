Gen. Ronald Burgess painted a picture of global tension in limbo.\nThey said they believed Iran has not yet decided to build a nuclear weapon, and Israel has not yet decided whether to strike Iran to stop any weapons-building.\nClapper said Iran is unlikely to start a conflict because Ayatollah Ali Khamenei would not risk it.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nNLVL\n\nLoad-Date: February 17, 2012"
