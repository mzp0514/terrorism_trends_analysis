Two Florida freshmen on his committee - Democrats Tim Mahoney of Palm Beach and Ron Klein of Boca Raton - will help lead the effort, he said.\nThe Senate Banking Committee has scheduled its own hearing for April 11 on how to address the high costs of homeowners insurance in disaster-prone areas.\nFlorida Gov. Charlie Crist, a Republican, pushed for such a fund during a visit last month to Washington.\nFew details about which of several emerging approaches will be considered by Frank's committee were discussed by the lawmakers Thursday. The bills already introduced include one from Florida Republican Reps. Ginny Brown-Waite of Brooksville and Vernon Buchanan of Longboat Key.\nThe general goal of such a national fund would be to provide so-called \"reinsurance\" to assist state insurance programs, private insurers and reinsurers with financial backup for claims that reach catastrophic proportions. The notion is that if companies knew their losses would be capped, they would be under less pressure to raise rates.\nState catastrophe funds would contribute to the federal one so that federal taxpayers would not be forced to foot the whole bill. But it is also likely that states would be permitted to opt in or out of contributing to, and thus benefiting from, such a national insurance pool.\nThere's a clear strategy behind efforts to liken a flood and natural catastrophe fund to the terrorism insurance passed in 2002; it's a way to counter criticism that it would benefit only certain states, particularly Florida and other coastal states vulnerable to large-scale storm damage.\nAnother political strategy is to emphasize that catastrophes come in many forms - tornadoes, mudslides and earthquakes - and that the exploding costs of homeowners insurance is a national issue.\n\"It is not just a Florida problem,\" said Brown-Waite, during the news conference.\nSaid Buchanan, \"This is about all of us working together not just for Florida, but for the country.\"\nReporter Billy House can be reached at bhouse@tampatrib.com or (202) 662-7673.\nCopyright Â© 2007, The Tampa Tribune and may not be republished without permission.
