    "full text": "SAN FRANCISCO, November 12, (THEWILL) - The Igbo socio-cultural organization, 'Ohanaeze Ndigbo' has condemned the ongoing clampdown of key members of #EndSARS campaigners and their bank accounts.\n'Ohanaeze' warned that such action could trigger another protest that no one knows how it would end.\nA statement by the Group through its acting Secretary-General, Prince Uche Achi-Ogbaga said there was no need to freeze the accounts, noting that their protests were legitimate.\nThe statement reads in part: 'The protest is a legitimate weapon of complaint in a democracy. The right to protest any perceived negative action of government or organisation is upheld in the Constitution of the country. In fact, President Buhari himself led many protests against former President Jonathan.\n'The #EndSARS protest was peaceful and legitimate until some hoodlums were sent to disrupt and make it violent. So, freezing the accounts of the alleged leaders of the protest is high-handed, ill-advised and unnecessarily vindictive. Moreover, it has the capacity of triggering off another wave of protest, the end of which nobody can fathom.\nALSO READ: CBN Accuses 20 #EndSARS Campaigners Of Terrorism\n'The frozen accounts should be released immediately to allow sleeping dogs to lie.\n'Some people are sponsoring Boko Haram, have they frozen their accounts? The protesters were peaceful until some SUVs were seen in viral videos dropping hoodlums and we started causing chaos. Have they fished out the people? Let this Government be sincere to itself.'\n\nLoad-Date: November 13, 2020"
