First responders used REACT for hurricanes Ivan, Katrina, Gustav and Ike. Multiple agencies currently use REACT for the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster. NVision and its partners routinely use REACT for exercise control in emergency response exercises around the nation.\nSocorro Harvey, NVision president, said, \"REACT is becoming an important part of our nation's homeland security framework. \"\nREACT is the result of seven years of NASA-funded research through the Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program, the NASA Dual-Use Technology Transfer Program and the NASA Innovative Partnership Program.\nCurrent REACT users include: all NASA centers throughout the country; Hancock County; St. Tammany Parish, La.; Mississippi National Guard; National Center for Spectator Sports Safety and Security; and, Center for Asymmetric Warfare.\n\nLoad-Date: August 13, 2010"
