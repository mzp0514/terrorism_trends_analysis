    "full text": "The recent crash of TWA Flight 800 in New York and the Saudi Arabian barracks bombing prompt this letter.\nWhere we have troops in foreign countries, those people don't like us.\nThe Saudis and Muslims hate us; the Saudis hate their corrupt monarchy.\nIn an attempt to reduce danger to U.S. citizens, military and civilian, we should station all of our troops in the United States. During World War II it took weeks to send troops to foreign countries, now we can do so in hours. So, when our interests are in danger, we can still honor our commitments quickly.\nWhy, after so many years, do we still have troops in Japan and Germany?\nLook who is always fighting: Arabs vs. Jews, Irish Catholics vs. Irish Protestants, and the many tribal wars in Africa. The Serbs and Croats have hated each other for centuries. We cannot afford to be the world's policemen.\nNormalize relations with Cuba. Our allies want that. Miami Cubans could return home, and it would help our economy.\nThis proposal won't eliminate terrorism but it will reduce hatred against the United States and the loss of innocent lives. It will help reduce the budget deficit, the balance of trade deficit and the national debt.\nLet's spend some of the money saved on helping our needy citizens and clean up our air and water. Let's save the country for our children.\n\nLoad-Date: July 25, 1996"
