Worse-than-expected losses could lead the rating agency to revise its stable ratings outlook, Fitch said.\nGlobal reinsurers have benefited from adequate premium levels and strong capitalization over the last couple of years, and their results should remain ``reasonably healthy'' this year, according to Fitch.\nOver the next 12 to 24 months, the agency expects to affirm financial strength ratings for the vast majority of reinsurers, with a roughly equal number of upgrades and downgrades in a smaller number of cases.\nThis would continue the trend of the last two years and mark a change from 2002 and 2003, when dozens of reinsurers were downgraded amid reserve adequacy and other concerns.\nMarket competition is one area where changes could affect the industry's stable outlook, Fitch says. Katrina's impact on reinsurance rates remains uncertain, but excess market capacity will likely make it more difficult to maintain profitable books of business in the next two years, Fitch predicts.\nThe market in 2006 will probably be more competitive than this year, and competition in 2007 will reach the point where reinsurers will have to employ ``cycle management strategies,'' including exiting unprofitable lines and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share buy-backs.\nFitch has been ``pleasantly surprised'' by reinsurers' underwriting discipline to date, and hasn't seen any signs yet of a ``feeding frenzy'' among reinsurers eager to use excess capital, Mr. Rouck pointed out.\nA soft market cycle, meanwhile, will fuel another trend: increased merger and acquisition activity and diversification by reinsurers unable to produce profitable organic growth.\nReinsurers are more likely to try to acquire books of business and underwriting teams from rivals than to expose themselves to potential legacy liabilities by buying the companies themselves, Fitch noted.\nStill, the industry's track record in merger activity and diversification into unfamiliar lines of business is ``mixed at best,'' and the trend could become a negative factor in Fitch's outlook, the agency said.\nFederal and state regulatory investigations of finite reinsurance transactions could also become a rating question for some reinsurers.\nFinite products are only a small part of the overall market, and falling demand for the products will probably produce only a drag on earnings for some reinsurers. Reduced interest in finite reinsurance will probably also produce more demand for traditional reinsurance coverages, Fitch said.\nA small number of specialist finite reinsurers may see their ratings cut, though, as a result of possible large declines in premium volume or legal action, Fitch reported.\nChanges in reinsurers' terrorism exposures could also alter the industry's stable outlook.\nIf the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act is not extended beyond its year-end 2005 expiration, demand for commercial terrorism reinsurance will grow, creating both opportunity and substantial risk for reinsurers, the agency noted.\nThe industry's stable outlook assumes a limited exposure to terrorism risk, Fitch said.\nThe report, ``Mid-Year 2005 Global Reinsurance Review and Outlook: Steady as She Goes, but Do Troubled Waters Lie Ahead?'' is available on the rating agency's Web site, www.fitchratings.com.\n\nLoad-Date: September 14, 2005"
