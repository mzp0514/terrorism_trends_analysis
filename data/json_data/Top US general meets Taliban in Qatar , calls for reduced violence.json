The announcement also left Roku users wondering when a deal with the streaming content provider would happen for them.\nUnited States officials have accused the Taliban of stepping up attacks on Afghan security forces, as well as other civilian targets, even as the group's negotiators meet government officials in Doha.\nAfghan officials have blamed the Taliban for carrying out the attack. At least three people were killed in Kabul in attacks this week, authorities said.\nThe Prime Minister of Pakistan pledged his country's support for the reduction of violence and the establishment of a ceasefire in Afghanistan.\nWhile the Taliban has maintained its commitment not to attacked American forces in Afghanistan under the U.S. -Taliban peace agreement from earlier this year, it has significantly ramped up attacks on Afghan security forces in an effort to gain leverage in the peace talks.\nThe Afghan government as well as other global stakeholders, including the United States, the United Nations, NATO, and human rights groups have all called for a ceasefire. In return, Taliban promised to break ties with Al-Qaida and provide counter terrorism guarantees in areas under their control. \"The higher the violence, the higher the risk\", he said. \"They are opposed to the process and creating roadblocks because their personal power and interests are in danger\".\nThe peace talks are scheduled to resume in Qatar on January 5. The Kabul team returned from Doha on Tuesday.\nAbout the next venue for the Afghan talks, Mr Qureshi said both sides had shared their points of view and preferences, but no final decision had been taken so far.\n\nLoad-Date: December 18, 2020"
