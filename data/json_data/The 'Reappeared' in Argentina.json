    "full text": "After the Falkland war, sun and shadow contend in Argentina. A discredited junta is doing what it should have done years ago: agreeing to yield power to civilians.\nEditorial calls on Argentina to account for 1,500 unidentified bodies found recently, presumed victims of terrorism that followed downfall of President Isabel Peron in 1976Political argument has revived, and even Peronists no longer seem so demagogic. Elections are promised for March 1984. Political parties are back in the sunlight where they belong.\nBut something else is also coming to the revealing light of day: some 1,500 unidentified bodies, remains of a state of siege when at least 6,000 Argentines ''disappeared.'' They are the presumed victims of a wave of terrorism that followed the downfall of President Isabel Peron in 1976. The darkness cannot truly lift until a way is found to identify the dead - and their killers.\nThe ruling junta, understandably nervous, now asks political leaders to agree to ''guidelines'' that could amount to granting the armed forces absolution in advance. There is an implicit threat: the military won't let go if it feels any heads will be at risk.  Ominously, the junta has suspended three magazines as a warning to a press that is now asking questions about those bodies.\nSilencing the press won't silence questions, nor can a future government fairly be bound to look the other way. Argentina pays heavily in world regard for the crimes whose evidence is now being shoveled from the earth. The redemption of Argentina's name, and its hopes for a return to the rule of law, hinge on a full inquiry."
