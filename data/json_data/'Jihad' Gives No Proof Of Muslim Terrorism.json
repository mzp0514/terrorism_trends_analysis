    "full text": "To the Editor:\nRe A. M. Rosenthal's \"Jihad in America\" (column, Feb. 3): Once again Muslims and their charitable organizations are accused of supporting terrorism overseas through fund-raising, military training and logistics. No real evidence of these activities has been offered by any credible source. Mr. Rosenthal merely cites the work of Steven Emerson, the producer of the PBS program \"Jihad in America.\"\nAccording to Mr. Rosenthal, \"Jihad in America\" detailed meetings \"where the cry of holy war went up against America.\" After analysis of the documentary and its source materials, it is clear that almost all the sound bites offered by Mr. Emerson referred to the defense of the Muslim community in Afghanistan.\nMr. Rosenthal also cites \"Jihad in America\" as proof of terrorist \"training\" and \"fund-raising\" in America. But what does the documentary show? Video of target practice is staged by Mr. Emerson at an unknown shooting range.\nMr. Rosenthal claims that American Muslim anger is directed at any \"action against Muslim terrorists.\" American Muslims support legal actions against those who attack civilians in the name of any cause. Is Mr. Rosenthal's hostility to Islam so strong and his love for the Constitution so weak that he would sacrifice civil rights of Americans to perpetuate Israel's military occupation of Palestinian land?\n \nIBRAHIM HOOPER\nCommunications Director, Council\non American-Islamic Relations\nWashington, Feb. 7, 1995\n\nLoad-Date: February 11, 1995"
