Bush's troubling financial connections to Enron, Halliburton and the mutual-fund industry.\nWith his buddy Kenneth Lay in hot water, and most of his administration being accused of shenanigans, I'm shocked that George W. Bush didn't think of getting a trial lawyer for his sidekick.\nSomeone needs to remind Sen. John Kerry that we are in the Middle East due to terrorism that the Clinton administration chose to ignore, not for oil.\nWhy is President George W. Bush flaunting John McCain, since he never wanted him for any position in his own administration?\nGeorge W. Bush has taken bold steps in fighting terrorism, which is something that Bill Clinton failed to do and something that Sen. John Kerry is not willing to do.\nJuly 19th is here. Perhaps Michael Moore would like to announce doing a film on Chappaquiddick?\nRe \"Local GOP mess should spur reform,\" July 9: The shady deals of local Republicans pale next to President George W.
