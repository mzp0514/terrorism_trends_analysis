    "full text": "WASHINGTON - The U.S. said Thursday that it will disclose the name of a Saudi citizen sought by lawyers for victims of the Sept. 11 attacks who want to link the kingdom to the terrorist plot.\nAttorney General William Barr had the option of invoking a \"state secrets\" privilege to withhold the release of the name, which lawyers for survivors and victims' relatives believe belongs to a Saudi government official who they say assigned two men in California to assist two of the hijackers.\nInstead, Justice Department lawyers said in a court filing that the FBI will make the name available to a limited circle of people that includes lawyers for survivors and victims' relatives as well as to attorneys for the Saudi government. The decision is a big step forward for Sept. 11 victims, who allege in a long-running lawsuit that Saudi Arabia provided support for the attacks.\nVictims' relatives believe that name could help them in establishing a link between the Saudi government and the Sept. 11 attacks, which is a matter of dispute. Barr invoked \"state secrets\" to block the release of other information in that report.\n\"This is a good result,\" Terry Strada, national chair of the 9/11 Families & Survivors United for Justice Against Terrorism, said in a statement.\n\nLoad-Date: September 14, 2019"
