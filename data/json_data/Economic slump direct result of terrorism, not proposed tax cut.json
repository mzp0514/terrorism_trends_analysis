    "full text": "Before a town hall meeting in Ontario, Calif., on Saturday, President Bush defended his tax cut against allegations by Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle that it is at least partly responsible for the nation's current economic slump.\nBush vowed, \"not over my dead body will they raise your taxes.\" He then predicted that critics would try to stop future phases of the tax cut from taking affect.\nU. Mississippi\nBush said, \"There are going to be people that say we can't have the tax cut go through anymore. That's a tax raise. And I challenge their economics when they say raising taxes will help the country recover.\"\nSpeaking on behalf of Democrats, Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota said that the president's economic proposals would not work. He said the GOP is \"proposing more tax cuts, mostly for the affluent and big corporations.\nThey will end up paying for their tax cut with money from the Social Security trust funds and by increasing federal debt.\" \"We have a better plan,\" he said, referring to the Democratic plan outlined by Daschle on Friday that consists of two business tax cuts designed to create jobs and encourage investment.\nIn his response Saturday Bush said, \"Somebody told me the funniest thing. They said, 'There's some in Washington saying that the tax cut caused the recession.' I don't know what economic textbook they're reading.\"\nHe claimed that tax cuts have the opposite effect. He said, \"If you think the economy is going to slow down, the best way to recover is to let people have their own money in their pockets to spend, not the government.\"\nBush went on to blame the Sept. 11 attacks for the current economic slump. He said, \"There is no question that the attacks of September 11 hurt our economy. I mean, there is no question about it -- the attacks affected the confidence of the American people.\"\nWhile squabbling over the economy may seem petty in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, recent polls show that most voters are more concerned about the economy than they are about terrorism.\nThis makes Bush's tax cut an important issue considering the crucial mid-term Congressional elections at the end of this year that could tip the balance of power in the currently Democrat-controlled Senate or the Republican-led House of Representatives. And while Bush is not yet running a campaign for re-election, losing the House could hurt his chances of pursuing his agenda during the remainder of his term in office.\nI tend to agree with Bush on this issue. The Democratic attempts to blame the current economic slowdown on the tax cut are nothing more than shameful political opportunism.\nBush is right in saying that our current economic problems are a direct result of terrorism.\nIn a time when the confidence of the American people is lacking, a tax cut that puts money back into the pockets of consumers is necessary to get our economy back on track and restore some of that confidence.\nHowever, I believe the current debate over a tax cut is a good thing. It is a sign that our country is hopefully beginning to recover from the devastation of Sept. 11.\n(C) 2002 Daily Mississippian via U-WIRE\n\nLoad-Date: January 8, 2002"
