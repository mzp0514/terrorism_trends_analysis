The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because a final decision has not been announced.\n\"This travel alert is a cumulative result of information we have received over an extended period,\" one senior administration official said. \"We are constantly monitoring a range of threat streams and have monitored this and others for some time.\"\nState Department spokesman P.J. Crowley declined to comment on the matter. But he said the government remained focused on al-Qaida threats to U.S. interests and would take appropriate steps to protect Americans.\nA European official briefed on the talks said the language in the U.S. alert was expected to be vague.\nIt won't address a specific country or specific landmarks, the official said.\nEuropean and U.S. officials have not identified any specific targets that terrorists might be considering, the official said. Officials have called the threat credible but not specific.\n\nLoad-Date: October 3, 2010"
