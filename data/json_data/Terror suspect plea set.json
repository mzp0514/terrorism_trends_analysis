Then six hours later, something else.\"\nOsmakac's attorney, public defender Alec Hall, entered Osmakac's not guilty plea on the court docket, eliminating the need for an arraignment, which had been scheduled for next week.\nLocal Muslim leaders disavowed Osmakac, saying he was banned from at least two local mosques for his radical views.\nOsmakac was taken into custody after an FBI sting in which he tried to buy explosives, at least 10 grenades, Uzis and an AK-47, authorities said.\nIf convicted, Osmakac faces life in federal prison.\nCopyright Â© 2012, The Tampa Tribune and may not be republished without permission.
