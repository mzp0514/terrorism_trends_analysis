The Toronto-born son of an alleged al-Qaida financier, Khadr pleaded guilty in 2010 to several charges, including killing a U.S. solider in Afghanistan when he was 15.\nEdney said that the defense team would first file an appeal with a U.S. military commission and that if that was unsuccessful, the team would turn to a U.S. civilian court.\nA U.S. civilian appeals court recently reversed the verdicts of the only two Guantanamo Bay prisoners convicted in trials by military tribunals.\nIn both cases, the reasoning was that before enactment of the Military Commissions Act of 2006, which authorized the tribunals for the terrorism suspects at Guantanamo, only violations of the international law of war and pre-existing federal offenses were subject to trial by military commission, a special court for wartime offenses.\nThe court said the charges of material support for terrorism and conspiracy did not meet that standard.\n\nLoad-Date: April 29, 2013"
