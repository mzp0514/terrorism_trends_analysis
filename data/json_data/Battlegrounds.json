    "full text": "Six weeks until Election Day, and in Washington both parties are hitting hard on national security: Republicans by pushing for passage of legislation governing the prosecution of terrorism suspects and Democrats by focusing on an intelligence report that the Iraq war helped increase the terrorism threat. But there is little evidence that Republicans are having success in altering the political climate in the most competitive House and Senate races. \n  Polls this past weekend showed Republicans trailing in Senate races in Maryland, Ohio and Pennsylvania. In Indiana, Representative John Hostettler, a Republican, is trailing his Democratic opponent by double digits, according to a new poll.\nIn one bit of good news for Republicans, Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, may be in trouble; but that may be countered by the problems of Senator George Allen, Republican of Virginia. \n  With a few exceptions, House Republicans are playing defense rather than offense, spending most of their money to stamp out Democratic challengers in Florida, Indiana, Iowa, New Mexico, Ohio and Pennsylvania. On the Senate side, Republicans have put all their advertising money this month, about $3.5 million, into Missouri, Ohio and Tennessee. Winning any of those states would make it almost impossible for Democrats to capture the Senate.   ADAM NAGOURNEY\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: September 26, 2006"
