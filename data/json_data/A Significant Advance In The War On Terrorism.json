    "full text": "The war on terrorism gained major ground with the capture of a top al-Qaida officer, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed.\nThe man who sent money to the Sept. 11 terrorists was, when taken into custody in Pakistan, planning other creative ways to kill American civilians.\nIt appears that Osama bin Laden has just lost his chief operating officer.\nThe 37-year-old Mohammed helped bomb a Philippines jet in 1994. He plotted to kill Pope John Paul II in the Philippines in 1995. The next year he was indicted in the United States for planning to blow up a dozen U.S. airliners over the Pacific. He helped organize the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa and, in 2000, the suicide attack on the USS Cole in Yemen.\nHe was likely the man who cut the throat of kidnapped reporter Daniel Pearl of The Wall Street Journal.\nIn the face of relentless pursuit, Mohammed decided al-Qaida would hit less-protected targets such as nightclubs. Five months ago, just such a bombing in Bali killed 192 people. Last month, three hours before 19 people died in a synagogue explosion in Tunisia, Mohammed had been on the phone with the bomber.\nHis latest plan was to put al-Qaida operatives in tanker trucks to ram fuel pumps at gas stations; send terrorists up suspension bridges to cut cables; and supply them with bombs to blow up power plants.\nThere are only partial defenses against such activities. The devils so determined to destroy the innocent must themselves be destroyed. The arrest and ongoing interrogation of Mohammed - an interrogation that we must believe is extremely conscientious - should send a message to the world's terrorists: America is on the hunt, you are the prey, and there are few places to hide.\n\nNotes\n\nOUR OPINION\n\nLoad-Date: March 6, 2003"
