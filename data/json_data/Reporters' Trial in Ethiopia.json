    "full text": "To the Editor:\n''What's He Got to Hide?,'' by Nicholas D. Kristof (column, Jan. 29), is intended to incite opposition to the government of Ethiopia, when it would be far better to assist the government in its effort to improve conditions for its people. The two Swedish journalists referred to in the column, Johan Persson and Martin Schibbye, were tried in an open and transparent court proceeding where they were represented by lawyers of their choice.\nDuring the court proceedings, the pair admitted to entering the country illegally, violating the sovereignty of Ethiopia, but pleaded not guilty to supporting terrorism, claiming to have entered Ethiopia to gather information about a Swedish oil company working in the Somali region, not to research human rights, as claimed by Mr. Kristof.\nThe two journalists were captured by Ethiopian troops after a clash with the group of terrorists escorting them. The court found that this fact demonstrated the level of cooperation between the Ogaden National Liberation Front and the two journalists. It was on this basis that the two were found guilty of supporting the O.N.L.F. and crossing the border illegally.\nThe government fully respects the right of the media to work freely within the framework of its legal obligations and responsibilities. The law in Ethiopia applies equally to all citizens and professions, including journalists. It is the same everywhere in the world.\nTESFAYE YILMA SABO Deputy Chief of Mission Embassy of Ethiopia Washington, Feb. 1, 2012\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: February 4, 2012"
