According to the Army, the aim of the international 'paymasters' sponsoring the insurgents was to \"cut Nigeria to size.\n\" In an article published on Wednesday, the Acting Director, Army Public Relations, Col Sagir Musa, said some international paymasters were sponsoring the insurgents. This is coming against the backdrop of the killing of over 43 farmers and abduction of 10 women by the militants in Zabarmari, Borno State, on Saturday.\n  Musa said : \"The recent killing of our people on a rice farm in Borno State was unexpected, inhuman, cowardly, dastardly and sadistic cruelty by the Boko Haram terrorists. \"There is no normal human being that will take pleasure in such inhuman massacre of defenceless and armless civilians, working on their farms but that is the nature of terrorism and those who sponsor it.\n \"There is an international conspiracy to cut Nigeria to size and compromise national renegades making attempts to destabilise and dismember Nigeria if possible in subservience to the international paymasters, who are the owners of Boko Haram. They train them, arm them, finance them and supply their logistics.\n\" According to Musa, but for the international support for Boko Haram, the sect would have since been defeated. \n\nLoad-Date: December 3, 2020"
