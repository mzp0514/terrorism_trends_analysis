    "full text": "The Boeing Company has applied to the Federal Government for permission to sell $600 million worth of commercial jet airliners to Libya.\nSales to Libya of aircraft and other equipment that might be converted to military use have not been approved by Washington in recent years, and trade with the African country has been subject to numerous restrictions because of the United States Government's contention that Libya has supported international terrorism.\nThe Boeing Company has applied to the Federal Government for permission to sell $600 million worth of commercial jet airliners to Libya.\nOfficials of the Commerce Department, which handles export licenses, could not be reached by telephone for comment last night.  A spokesman for the Boeing Commercial Aircraft Company in Seattle said that the application had been made after Boeing was approached by Libya Arab Airlines, a state-owned commercial carrier, to buy 12 new jets.\nThe spokesman, Russell G. Schley, said Libya presently owns 15 American-made jet airliners, including a Boeing 707 and several 727's. However, no sales have been made in recent years.\nThe Libyan airline, he said, was seeking to expand its service, which reaches 23 cities outside the country, most of them in Europe.  Any license for export of aircraft to Libya would require notice to Congress 30 days in advance of approval.  The Boeing Company, suffering declining revenues and earnings this year, announced last week that it would reduce its work force in Seattle, its home base, by 9,000 in 1983. The bulk of the personnel reductions are planned for the commercial aircraft division."
