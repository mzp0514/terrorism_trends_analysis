    "full text": "EDWARDSVILLE - A judge on Friday ordered a competency evaluation for a man accused of making a terrorist threat because of her own \"bona fide doubt of (his) fitness for trial.\"\nAssociate Judge Jennifer Hightower appointed Daniel Cuneo, a forensic psychologist in Belleville, to examine Keaun Cook, 18, of Godfrey. Cook is held in the Madison County Jail on charges of making a terrorist threat and providing material support for terrorism.\nHightower was to hold a hearing Friday on a motion by State's Attorney Tom Gibbons to deny bail for Cook. But she chose to order an evaluation after observing Cook in court on Wednesday.\nDuring that hearing, Cook rambled about a \"situation\" and said \"the wrong picture has been painted.\" Hightower stopped the proceeding once Cook agreed to representation by Madison County Public Defender John Rekowski, already in the courtroom at her request.\nRelatives say Cook suffers from mental illness. \"My grandson is not a terrorist,\" said Debra Thomas of Godfrey, his grandmother. \"He just has mental issues.\"\nRekowski said, \"I think the sheriff and state's attorney were absolutely justified in moving forward when they did. With these allegations, you have to err on the side of caution,\"\nHe added, \"Now, let's do the next right thing about whether this man is a terrorist or sick. Knowing what I know of him so far, about his background and extensive mental health issues, I think he's sick. And in this country, we don't lock up sick people.\"\nGibbons has said the sheriff's office developed the case after getting a tip that Cook was linked to threats of a terrorist attack in the area. He was charged Sept. 1.\nHightower said she will set a new hearing after receiving Cuneo's report.\nWhen Cook was charged, Gibbons alleged that the teen had been in contact through social media \"with individuals (Cook) believed would be capable of committing a mass casualty terrorist attack\" somewhere in the local area. Gibbons said investigators went to the Thomas residence in the 1300 block of Sir Galahad Lane on a \"welfare check\" and developed evidence linking Cook to terrorist threats.\nGibbons said deputies obtained a recording that supports the charges; he declined to cite its source.\nPTSD IS CITED\nIn an interview this week, Thomas said Cook has suffered from mental illnesses since he saw his mother die from complications of lupus in 2011, when he was 13. She said he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, started getting in frequent trouble for minor violations and was in and out of mental health centers over the next few years. Eventually, she said, he was diagnosed with schizophrenia.\nCook became aggressive and paranoid and was unable to drive or hold a job, Thomas said. He would talk to himself and refused to use phones or other electronic devices because he thought he was being watched, she said.\nThomas said she tried to get help for Cook, but no one responded. She said she called officials to her home on Aug. 24, hoping they would take him to a mental health institution.\nWhen sheriff's deputies decided to leave Cook at the home, Thomas said, she played a recording she made that day of Cook talking to himself and showed them messages she found on his phone, also that day.\n\"He was talking out of his head,\" she said.\nOfficials then took Cook to a mental facility where he spent five days, Thomas said. Two days after he returned home, officers arrested him.\n\"He has mental issues - that's the only reason I called that night,\" she said. \"I wanted to get him help. Not get him in trouble.\"\nCook does not present a danger, Thomas said. While he was paranoid and acted out, his behavior was made worse by the treatment he experienced in the juvenile justice system, she said.\n\"I did my part,\" she said. \"The system failed him.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \n Keaun Cook, 18, of Godfrey was charged with one count of making a terrorist threat and one count of material support for terrorism. Prosecutors say he was in contact with people he believed capable of committing a mass casualty terrorist act.  \n\nLoad-Date: September 13, 2016"
