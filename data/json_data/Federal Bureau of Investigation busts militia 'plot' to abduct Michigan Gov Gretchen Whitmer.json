    "full text": "President Trump looks out from the White House after his release from Walter Reed Medical Center this week.\nMembers of the group had anti-government views and were plotting to kidnap the Democrat from her summer home, the affidavit filed in court and revealed on Thursday.\nThe FBI thwarted a plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and charged six people saying they had contemplated a violent overthrow of the government.\nThe total number of men charged in the alleged plot to kidnap Whitmer is now 13.\nMI attorney general Dana Nessel disclosed additional state charges against seven men affiliated with the Wolverine Watchmen for allegedly violating the state's anti-terrorism act by conspiring to kidnap the governor and propagate violence. I condemn all White supremacists.\n\"Just last week, the president of the United States stood before the American people and refused to condemn white supremacists and hate groups, like these two MI militia groups\". They want their lives back again, safely!\n\"Hate groups heard the president's words not as a rebuke, but as a rallying cry, as a call to action\", Whitmer said in an address from Lansing.\nShe brought up last week's presidential debate, where Trump repeatedly had to be asked to condemn white supremacists groups until he finally said that those groups should \"stand back and stand by\".\nThe bottom line is, Republicans have zero interest in combatting white supremacy and violent extremist groups since that is their voting base.\nTD demands urgent supports for Portlaoise home hit by Covid-19\nThere are calls for a \"thorough investigation\" into the rising number of cases of Covid-19 in nursing homes. The hospital has been helping the home since September 30 after Toronto Public Health issued an order.\n\"Just last week, the president of the United States stood before the American people and refused to condemn white supremacists and hate groups like these two MI militia groups\", Whitmer said at a press conference. They carry weight. When our leaders meet, encourage or fraternise with domestic terrorists, they legitimise their actions and they are complicit. \"When they stoke and contribute to hate speech, they are complicit\".\nMiller then accused Whitmer of having \"hatred in her heart towards President Trump\" and claimed that the president is quick to condemn radical groups, both on the right and left. \"America stands united against hate and in support of our federal law enforcement who stopped this plot\", McEnany said.\nWhitmer and Trump have been frequent critics of one another in recent months, sparring over the the coronavirus crisis and how best to resolve it.\nOn May Day, dozens of protesters, some of them heavily armed, occupied the MI state capitol building with some chanting \"lock her up\" in reference to Ms Whitmer.\nAnother person alleged to be involved in the plot,Daniel Harris, suggested in an encrypted group chat that they \"Have one person go to her house\".\nThe Michigan governor said she has made \"tough choices to keep our state safe\" and expressed sympathy for losses suffered by local residents and businesses.\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, who hopes to unseat Trump in the November 3 general election, also sought to connect the president's rhetoric to domestic terrorism.\n\"I just wanna make the world glow, dude\".\n\nLoad-Date: October 9, 2020"
