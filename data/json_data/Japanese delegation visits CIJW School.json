This visit holds special significance, seen in the light of growing defence ties between India and Japan. In recent years, there has been an increasing role of various militaries in Counter Terrorism and Counter Insurgency aspects, especially towards combating terrorism in the Arabian Peninsula.  Japan in its endeavors to enhance its contribution towards fighting Global terror, is also catering for its future.\n\nThe members of the delegation during their visit were introduced to the infrastructure of the CIJW School and its functioning. The visit concluded with an open house discussion with the faculty and interaction with Major General M S Ghura, of CIJW School, where mementos were exchanged between the CIJW School and delegation. M S Ghura, in a recent interview at Vairengte, Mizoram, had said, \"Japanese forces will also be coming and as a prelude to it, a team of army officers from that country has made a survey and study.
