Just in case some ne'er do well tried a stunt similar to the Oklahoma City bombing, Pasco's Office of Emergency Management is investigating the terrorist threat close to home.\nTERROR14\nMichele Baker, the county's emergency management director, calls terrorism a \"low probability event.\" But she said it's better to be safe than sorry.\n\"With the increase in domestic terrorism nationwide, it's not an improbable event. I'm sure the people of Oklahoma City didn't think they were a target either,\" she said.\nThe state is mandating that every county assess its potential terrorism threat.\nThe assessment will include confidential information from the sheriff's office about potentially threatening groups operating within the county and any possible targets.\nWhile performing the assessment, Baker's office decided to apply for an optional $ 50,000 grant, money to pay for a consultant to help write \"terrorism response procedures.\"\nEven if Pasco never battles terrorism, the exercise won't be wasted, Baker said. The county can apply the procedures to more obvious emergencies such as natural disasters.\n\"We're looking at this not so much as Pasco's terrorist threat but Pasco's threat from any unusual emergency,\" she said.\n\nLoad-Date: February 15, 2001"
