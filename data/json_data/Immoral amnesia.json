In Rajoub's view, noting its role in an event that was a milestone in the histories of both the Olympics and terrorism would create \"divisiveness\" and contribute to \"the spread of racism.\"\nOnly a mindset forged in the belief that using terror is legitimate could find divisiveness in standing against the murder of innocents.\nOnly someone who equates the existence of a Jewish state with the oppression of Muslims and Arabs could see the promotion of racism in recalling that Palestinians killed Israelis.\nIOC Chief Jacques Rogge gave succor to those views when he should have made a globally unifying statement against terrorism by anyone.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nNLVL\n\nLoad-Date: July 28, 2012"
