    "full text": "FBI agents investigating terrorism-related activities were conducting a number of raids and made several arrests Thursday, federal officials said.\n  U.S. Attorney R. Alexander Acosta said in a statement that more details about the ongoing operation would be released Friday. Local media reported that agents were raiding a warehouse in Miami's Liberty City section.\n\"There is no imminent threat to Miami or any other area because of these operations,\" said Richard Kolko, spokesman for FBI headquarters in Washington. He declined further comment.\n  Attorney General Alberto Gonzales was scheduled to hold a news conference on Friday to discuss the raid. A simultaneous news conference was to be held in Miami.\n  Cedric Thomas, an owner of Thomas Produce Market, told The Miami Herald the area around his store was teeming with federal agents.\n  \"There is a ton of guys in uniforms moving around, blocking the streets,\" Thomas said.\n  Several terrorism investigations have had south Florida links. Several of the Sept. 11 hijackers lived and trained in the area, including ringleader Mohamed Atta, and several plots by Cuban-Americans against Fidel Castro's government have been based in Miami.\n  Jose Padilla, a former resident once accused of plotting to detonate a radioactive bomb in the U.S., is charged in Miami with being part of a North American terror cell.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: June 24, 2006"
