    "full text": "This summer lefties ballistic when George Bush said the U.S. might never win the war against terrorism. The President later explained he meant the conflict would not close with the signing of surrender documents and other rituals observed in traditional wars.\nThe critics were not appeased.\nIn a recent puff piece in the Sunday magazine of The New York Times, John Kerry said he would work to bring terrorism down to the acceptable level of a mere \"nuisance.\" Caterwaulers who denounced Bush's defeatism did not denounce Kerry's.\nKerry's comment was not a slip. It reflects an approach that sees terrorism primarily as a problem for law enforcement. Although Kerry talks of tracking down terrorists and killing them, numerous statements imply he sees the challenge as something less than war. No one would have been surprised if during the debates he had embraced Project Exile, Weed and Seed, Neighborhoods in Bloom, midnight basketball, and other domestic anti-crime programs as appropriate responses to jihadism.\nAnd what, pray tell, would be an acceptable level of terror? A major incident annually? One Cole per year, or two embassies?\nNo one would have asked Winston Churchill or Franklin Roosevelt to define an acceptable rate of Nazi atrocities.\nThe police do a wonderful job. Law enforcement depends on battlefield-like heroism and military-like skill. But the good guys did not win World War I, World War II, and the Cold War by sending in the forces of \"CSI: Miami.\"\n\nLoad-Date: October 19, 2004"
