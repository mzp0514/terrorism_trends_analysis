S. State Department has identified Afghanistan, Kenya, Sudan and South Africa as high-risk travel areas on its Web page because of recent terrorist attacks.\n\"The truth of the matter is, you can't worry about terrorism … you'll go crazy,\" said Steffen Schmitt, program chairman of International Studies. \"People who are worried about traveling shouldn't travel. Terrorism is random, and there is nothing you can do about it.\"\n(C) 1999 Iowa State Daily via U-WIRE\n\nLoad-Date: February 2, 1999"
