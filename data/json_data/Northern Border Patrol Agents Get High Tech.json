During the past three years, the sheriff's office reported dozens of rescues and responses to incidents using the boat.\nThe sheriff's office said the boat's technology can thwart a wide variety of crimes. The on-board nuclear radiation detection equipment allows officials to detect threats like dirty bombs to provide a unified picture of both land- and water-based imagery. A forward-looking infrared imaging system (FLIR) allows officials to continue operations in low light and sonar equipment allows the detection of underwater threats or smuggling attempts.\nPhoto courtesy of the Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Office\n___ (c)2012 Government Technology Visit Government Technology at www.govtech.com Distributed by MCT Information Services\n\nLoad-Date: October 18, 2012"
