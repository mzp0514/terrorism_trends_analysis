    "full text": "LONDON - President Donald Trump has misinterpreted British crime statistics and wrongly blamed terrorism as the driving factor behind higher numbers. Terror attacks in Manchester and London that killed 35 people only account for 1/100th of a percent of the total number of crimes recorded in the report, and homicides are actually down 2 percent.\nTRUMP tweet: \"Just out report: 'United Kingdom crime rises 13% annually amid spread of Radical Islamic terror.' Not good, we must keep America safe!\"\nThe facts: The 13 percent increase cited by Trump refers to crime in England and Wales, not the entire U.K., which also includes Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nFigures released Thursday show that police forces in England and Wales registered 5.2 million criminal offenses in the 12 months through June - a 13 percent increase over the previous year.\nThe London and Manchester terrorist attacks resulted in 35 homicides and 294 attempted murder offences, said the Office for National Statistics. But those 329 cases account for less than 1/100th of a percent of the total number of crimes recorded in the report.\nThe biggest jumps in crime reports came in vehicle thefts (17 percent) and shoplifting (11 percent), according to the statistics office. Significant increases were also reported in thefts from individuals, burglary and robbery.\nThe number of homicides actually dropped 2 percent to 664, even with the terror-related killings in London and Manchester.\nIt was the highest number or arrests since authorities began collecting data in 2001.\n\nLoad-Date: October 21, 2017"
