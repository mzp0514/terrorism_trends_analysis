    "full text": "WASHINGTON -- An FBI whistle-blower alleges FBI headquarters rewrote Minnesota agents' pre-Sept 11 request for surveillance and search warrants for terrorism defendant Zacarias Moussaoui and removed important information before rejecting them, government officials said Friday.\nAgent Coleen Rowley wrote that the Minnesota agents became so frustrated by roadblocks erected by terrorism supervisors in Washington that they began to joke that FBI headquarters was becoming an \"unwitting accomplice\" to Osama bin Laden's efforts to attack the United States, the officials said.\nAs new details emerged about the letter Rowley wrote to FBI Director Robert Mueller, members of Congress sought to extend her whistle-blower protections and encouraged more agents to come forward.\nAnd a joint panel of House and Senate members set the first hearings to examine what the government knew before Sept. 11 about terrorist threats and what mistakes it made.\n\"This (Rowley) letter documents exactly what headquarters knew and when, and how midlevel officials sabotaged the Moussaoui case before the attacks,\" Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said Friday.\nOfficials familiar with Rowley's memo said she alleged FBI headquarters terrorism supervisors rewrote the Minnesota office's warrant applications and affidavit and removed intelligence about Moussaoui before sending them to a legal office that then rejected them as insufficient.\nShe alleged that some of the revisions \"downplayed\" the significance of some intelligence linking Moussaoui to Islamic extremists, and blamed the changes on a flawed communication process.\n\"Obviously, verbal presentations are far more susceptible to mischaracterization or error,\" Rowley wrote in her 13-page letter, excerpts of which were obtained by The Associated Press.\nThe Minnesota office was concerned after arresting Moussaoui at a Minnesota flight school in August 2001 that he was seeking to hurt Americans and wanted to gather more information through national security and search warrants, including getting information off his computer.\nSome of that information came from an associate of Moussaoui who told the FBI the flight student held extreme anti-American views. Other intelligence came from France linking Moussaoui to radical Islamic extremists in the region although not directly to al-Qaida, officials said.\n\nLoad-Date: May 27, 2002"
