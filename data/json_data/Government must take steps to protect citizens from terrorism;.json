    "full text": "Editor's note: Two weeks ago, Our Generation writer Nathan Empsall wrote an\n article critical of what he considered an attack on civil liberties by\n President Bush and his administration. Today, an Our Generation member\n responds to that editorial.\n In the wake of Sept. 11, President Bush declared war on terrorists and made\n steps to wipe out terrorism, concentrating first on the Middle East.\nThe hijackers who used planes as bombs on Sept. 11 did not just happen to\n be Muslim Arabs - their beliefs served as motivation for the attacks,\n something made clear by their leaders. These terrorists were sent here as\n enemy soldiers to kill Americans.\n In wartime, enemy soldiers are tried by military tribunals. They have no\n civil liberties because they are not citizens. Military law is different from\n civil law in many regards. And where are these thousands of detainees Empsall\n mentions? The Bush administration has been very careful not to profile\n Arab-Americans unjustly.\n Illegal immigration is a bigger problem for the United States. When people\n come here illegally, they have no civil rights. Recent proposals to give tax\n money to illegal immigrants are ridiculous. If these people can be found, they\n should be deported, not rewarded.\n American citizenship is not a right, it is a privilege. We have no\n obligation to allow foreign students in or even allow immigration to continue\n at all.\n We are a generous society, but we should have no mercy for foreign\n terrorists, and we should respect our own borders. If immigrants are coming\n here for peaceful reasons, let them do it through the proper channels.\n Obviously the process isn't too difficult when you consider the flaws that\n allowed the hijackers into the country.\n\nLoad-Date: January 29, 2003"
