There were 60 in the whole state.\nAJC\nOnly one other area of the country, northern California, including the San Francisco area, had more federal domestic terrorism cases during the last five years.\nLaw enforcement officials say North Georgia, which includes Atlanta, isn't necessarily a nexus of American radicalism. But it does have a history that might make law enforcement agencies sensitive to investigating the possibility of terrorism.\n\"It's the birthplace of the civil rights movement,\" said Vernon Keenan, assistant director of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. \"Law enforcement works closely together and monitors groups that advocate\" terrorism.\nPatrick Crosby, spokesman for the U.S. Justice Department's Atlanta office, said another factor was the 1996 Olympic Games. Because of the Games, the area has had a terrorism task force for years, routinely bringing local, state and federal investigators together.\nThe TRAC study analyzed five years of U.S. Department of Justice terrorism cases between Oct. 1, 1996, and Sept. 30, 2001. Few terrorism cases opened since the Sept. 11 hijackings are included in the study.\nThe analysts found the number of international terrorism cases referred to prosecutors rose dramatically in recent years, from 48 in 1997 to 204 in 2001.\nIn addition, between 1997 and 2001, international cases that federal attorneys opted to prosecute grew from eight to 57.\nDomestic terrorism cases also increased, from 147 referred to prosecutors in 1997 to 259 in 2001.\nHowever, the number of domestic cases actually prosecuted during the five years dropped 20 percent, from 47 to 38.\nJustice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona said the study does not present the complete picture.\nShe said the statistics do not include classified cases. The federal government now investigates more than 10,000 terrorism complaints every year.\n\"It ranges from someone blowing up a building to sending a threatening e-mail,\" she said.\nAlthough the definition of a terrorist crime is somewhat vague, the charges include certain weapons and explosive offenses, terrorist threats and murdering or attacking Americans overseas.\nTalamona said terrorism cases are different from most criminal cases because the goal is often to prevent an attack or disrupt an organization. So authorities sometimes decide not to prosecute in exchange for information that could prevent more serious crimes or attacks.\n\"Our focus will not be reflected solely in the prosecution statistics,\" Talamona said.\nAfter Sept. 11, U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft made the prevention and investigation of terrorism the most important priority for the Justice Department.\nRobert Friedmann, chair of the criminal justice department at Georgia State University, said terrorism cases are difficult to build, making military tribunals more effective.\n\"On one side, you have the people who strap a bomb to themselves [and] blow themselves up in a bus,\" he said. \"On the other, you have to go into a mosque or a church, and guys are giving money to charities [that are supporting terrorists], and it's very difficult to connect that.\"\nIn many cases, there is evidence suggesting a crime, but it falls below the standard used in civilian courts, he said.\nAccording to the study, weak evidence doomed about 40 percent of the terrorism cases federal attorneys declined to prosecute.\n\"The difficulty is the lack of ability of the judicial system to deal with this problem,\" Friedmann said. \"It's not a lack of desire. In a wartime situation, [a military tribunal] is the way to go.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \nGraphic:\nTRACKING PROSECUTIONS\nDomestic terrorism cases referred to federal prosecutors\n..................… 1997..1998..1999..2000..2001..Total..Rank\nNorth California..........4… 3....20....10....43… 80… 1\n(includes San Francisco)\nNorth Georgia............11… 6… 4....11....19… 51… 2\n(includes Atlanta)\nMiddle Tennessee..........1....17… 6… 9....12… 45… 3\n(includes Nashville)\nMiddle Florida......… 17… 9… 5… 8… 5… 44… 4\n(includes Orlando)\nNorth Texas..........… 7… 7… 7....18… 5… 44… 4\n(includes Dallas)\nInternational terrorism cases referred to federal prosecutors\n..................… 1997..1998..1999..2000..2001..Total..Rank\nWashington D.C...........17… 3… 8… 9....30… 67… 1\nSouth New York......… 19… 2… 8… 4… 7… 40… 2\n(includes New York City)\nEast Virginia (includes.. 1… 0… 1… 0....27… 29… 3\nWashington suburbs)\nCentral California........2… 2… 6… 1....15… 26… 4\n(includes Los Angeles)\nEast Michigan........… 0… 0… 3… 0....20… 23… 5\n(includes Detroit)\nMiddle Georgia............0… 1… 0… 0… 0......1....41\n(includes Macon)\nSource: U.S. Justice Department, Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University\n\nLoad-Date: December 3, 2001"
