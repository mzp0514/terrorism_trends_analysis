    "full text": "WASHINGTON - A scathing new report blasts new intelligence hubs created after 9/11 as ineffective and riddled with wasteful spending.\nThe hubs - called fusion centers - were pushed by the 9/11 commission to \"connect the dots\" and spot the next terrorist plot before it goes operational.\nBut the report by Sens. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and Carl Levin (D-Mich.) charges that the centers haven't spotted a single terror plot despite receiving federal aid totaling between $289 million and $1.4 billion. The Department of Homeland Security wasn't able to provide an exact figure.\nThe centers \"forwarded 'intelligence' of uneven quality - oftentimes shoddy . . . and more often than not unrelated to terrorism,\" the senators wrote.\nThe report also slams the Arizona and California centers' use of homeland security funds to buy SUVs, flat-screen TVs and spy cameras that can be concealed in shirt buttons and hats.\nOther lawmakers, including Sens. Joseph Lieberman (I-Conn.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), who wrote the 2004 law calling for the system, said their colleagues of ignored successes.\nLast year, for example, a Massachusetts center helped take down a state resident plotting to fly explosive-laden remote control planes into the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nNLVL\n\nLoad-Date: October 4, 2012"
