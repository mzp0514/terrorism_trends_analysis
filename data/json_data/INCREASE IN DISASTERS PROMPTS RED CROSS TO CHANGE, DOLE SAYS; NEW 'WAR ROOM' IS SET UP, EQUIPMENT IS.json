    "full text": "Disasters - natural and man-made - have shot up 13 percent over the past five years, forcing the American Red Cross to revamp and regroup, president Elizabeth Dole said Thursday.\n\"It seems there's more (disasters) around the corner, constantly,\" Dole told hundreds attending a forum sponsored by the Regional Commerce and Growth Association at America's Center.\nDole blamed the increase in \"shifts in weather patterns and seismic changes,\" plus ethnic wars and terrorism. The result, she said, has ranged from the Midwest's Great Flood of 1993 to the mass killings in Rwanda.\nTo accommodate the disaster deluge, the privately funded Red Cross now runs an operations center dubbed \"the war room\" that Dole said \"never shuts down.\" The number of specially trained volunteers for \"catastrophic events\" has been expanded to 20,000 from 3,000 a few years ago.\nMillions of dollars recently have been spent on \"warehousing equipment in areas where disasters are more likely to occur,\" Dole said.\nIn more and more cases, she asserted, the Red Cross often offers the best, and sometimes only, help. She recounted \"stepping over dead bodies\" in a Rwanda refugee camp where she was struck that Red Cross workers were the only source of aid.\nDole acknowledged that her appeal here was aimed, in part, at getting more donations for the Red Cross, which she has headed since 1991. But she added that without the private disaster-response organization, governments at home and abroad would be unable to cope.\nAmong other things, the Red Cross is completing a $ 287 million overhaul of its blood-collection operation that Dole called \"the most wrenching cultural change our organization has ever been through.\"\nAs a result, St. Louis is the site of one of the eight state-of-the-art laboratories that now monitor the Red Cross' blood collections to make sure the nation's blood supply is \"safe to give and safe to get,\" Dole said.\nSt. Louis, she added, needs to focus its efforts on reducing its increasing rate of transmission of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. \"You're about third in the country,\" Dole noted.\nA few years ago, she said, concerns over the spreading of HIV and hepatitis through tainted blood products led some Red Cross officials to call for the agency to get out of the blood collection business.\n\"Who else would do it if we pulled out?\" Dole asked, noting that the Red Cross collects and distributes at least half of the nation's donated blood.\nA safe national blood supply, she said, is \"a major public policy issue far bigger than the American Red Cross.\"\nAlthough Dole focused primarily on policy, she didn't ignore her political past as a former Cabinet member and the wife of 1996 GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole.\nIn response to questions from the crowd, Dole predicted that \"we'll see a woman president in our lifetime\" - but appeared to take herself out of contention.\n\"I have no plans to run,\" she said, although adding that her husband's 1996 campaign run was \"probably the highlight of my life.\"\nIn an interview afterward, Dole gave hints that politics may still be in her blood.\nShe said she was flattered that she appears on so many Republican lists of presidential or vice presidential contenders, and demurred when asked if she would accept any GOP draft to join the 2000 ticket.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO Photo by BILL GREENBLATT - Elizabeth Dole, president of the American Red Cross, outlines her agency's disaster preparedness Thursday at America's Center.\n\nLoad-Date: June 19, 1998"
