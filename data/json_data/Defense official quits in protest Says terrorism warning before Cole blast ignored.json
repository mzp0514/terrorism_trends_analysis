    "full text": "A Pentagon intelligence specialist on terrorism in the Persian\nGulf resigned in protest one day after the bombing of the USS\nCole because his superiors had ignored his warnings of terrorist\nthreats in the region this summer, senators disclosed Wednesday.\nThe warnings by a mid-level, civilian Defense Intelligence Agency\nofficial, whose identity was withheld, were not passed on to military\ncommanders in the region, Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., said at an\nArmed Services Committee hearing.\nSenate intelligence committee aides interviewed the official this\nweek after he sent a letter of complaint to the panel. Roberts\nsaid the official had issued several warnings of terrorist threats\n-- most recently in August -- that he said were ignored by higher-ups.\nArmy Gen. Tommy Franks, commander of U.S. Central Command, told\nthe armed services panel that he received \"no specific threat\ninformation for Yemen or for the port of Aden,\" where the Cole\nwas refueling when it was hit on Oct. 12. The blast killed 17\nsailors and injured 39. \"Had such a warning been received, action\nwould have been taken,\" he said.\n\"There must be a seamless and immediate threat warning between\nour intelligence community and operations commanders,\" Roberts\ntold USA TODAY. \"It's obvious given the tragedy that we did not\nhave appropriate information or did not analyze it correctly.\"\nAt the time of the attack, the Cole was operating on the second-lowest\nof four levels of alert for terrorism.\nIn Aden, Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh said Wednesday that\nseveral senior members of the militant Muslim group Islamic Jihad\nwere detained in connection with the blast. He also said one of\nthe two suspected suicide bombers was an Egyptian. Officials say\nthey believe that two men steered a boat carrying a powerful bomb\nnext to the Cole and detonated it.\nSaleh did not say whether the attackers or detainees had any connection\nto hunted Saudi terrorist Osama bin Laden's group, Al-Qaida, which\nis based in Afghanistan. \"The results will be out soon,\" he\nsaid.\nOther developments:\n* A senior defense official said U.S. forces in Bahrain\nand Qatar were placed on high alert last weekend in response to\nreports of planned terrorist attacks on the U.S. embassies, an\ninternational school in Bahrain and a U.S. military site in Qatar,\nThe Associated Press said.\n* A suspected terrorist is believed to be in custody in\nBahrain in connection with a planned suicide-bomber attack on\nU.S. aircraft, ABC News reported.\n\nLoad-Date: October 26, 2000"
