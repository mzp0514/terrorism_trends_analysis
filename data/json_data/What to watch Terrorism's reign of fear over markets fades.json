    "full text": "Terrorism is losing its shock value, at least when it comes to the reaction of financial markets around the globe.\nAs terror attacks become more common, the reaction of investors is less panicky, less emotional and less bearish. Despite the human tragedy of the Paris attacks, financial markets around the globe, including France, shrugged off Friday's attack.\nIn a twist, shares rallied in the U.S., the first time that has happened on the first day of trading after an attack of this magnitude\n- a sign terrorism is having less of an impact on the global economy and markets as attacks become more common.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average rallied more than 200 points, and the Standard & Poor's 500 rallied 1.4% Monday. Shares were mostly higher in Europe, with the broad Stoxx Europe 600 closing up 0.3%. In France, the CAC 40 declined just 0.1%, after being down 1.2% in early trading.\nHistorical statistics bear out the thesis that terror is having a smaller impact on stocks. The S&P 500 fell 4.9% on the first day of trading after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and fell 11.6% in total.\nBut the losses are shrinking. In March 2004, the S&P 500 fell 1.5% on the first day of trading after the Madrid train bombing. It fell just 0.8% in July 2005 after the London subway bombing. Increasingly, investors are looking at history, and what they see is a market that dips after the initial attack but recovers swiftly. The hope is no attack will be so catastrophic to end the new trend.\n\nLoad-Date: November 17, 2015"
