    "full text": "When the Coast Guard decided it wanted to practice firing its new machine guns on the Great Lakes, it posted an item in the Federal Register -- not exactly household reading. Now that the public has caught up, there is an uproar all around the lakes -- in Canada as well as the United States -- and a belated decision to hold public hearings. \n  The Coast Guard's proposal is cautious and, as military exercises go, quite modest. It plans two or three test firings a year, a few hours each time, in 34 possible areas at least five nautical miles offshore. Officials argue that it is prudent to give crews heavier weapons than the handheld guns they carried on the lakes before 9/11.\nFew are disputing that the United States needs to do more to protect its borders against terrorists. But we face far more plausible threats than terrorists cutting across Lake Michigan in small boats. \n  As a defense against terrorism, militarizing the Great Lakes is a symbolic defeat. And it is another in a series of incremental changes that threaten to change everything that we take for granted about our country. \n  The question is how far we choose to militarize ourselves at home in response to terrorism. Turning the Great Lakes -- even on occasion -- into a live-fire zone is the kind of decision that says little to terrorists but speaks volumes to the rest of us.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: October 21, 2006"
