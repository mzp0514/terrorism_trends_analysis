He earned a bachelor's degree in public administration in 1981 from St. Joseph's University.  \nChief Rosini joined the Philadelphia Fire Department in 1971. He rose through the ranks and was named deputy fire chief in District 1 in 1986. He also served as the city's fire marshal before retiring in May as chief of the technical support unit. \nChief Rosini married Patricia Cangelosi in 1975, and the couple raised three children in Roxborough, where he was president of the Central Roxborough Civic Association and on the board of the Roxborough Development Corp.  \nAs a firefighter, Chief Rosini participated in many historic and tragic events in the city's history. He was one of the city officials involved in preparing for the 1979 visit of Pope John Paul II; he received Fire Department citations for the rescue of victims during Hurricane Floyd and the One Meridian Plaza fire; and he fought the Gulf refinery and both MOVE fires.  \nChief Rosini coordinated the department's duties during the 2000 Republican Convention. Over the years, he developed Fire Department plans for terrorism response. \nAfter Sept. 11, 2001, Chief Rosini was transferred to department headquarters and named head of the Fire Subcommittee of Southeast Pennsylvania Terrorism Task Force, where he developed the department's plans for terrorist attacks. He was an instructor for the Department of Defense's domestic preparedness program in more than 20 cities.  \nChief Rosini later developed the Early Responders Distance Learning Center at St. Joseph's University.  \nIn addition to his wife, Chief Rosini is survived by daughters Jennifer and Mary Frances; a son, Andrew; three sisters; and a brother.  \nFriends may visit at 9 a.m. today at Clare McIlvaine Mundy Funeral Home, 7384 Ridge Ave. A Funeral Mass will be said at 10:30 a.m. at St. Lucy Church.
