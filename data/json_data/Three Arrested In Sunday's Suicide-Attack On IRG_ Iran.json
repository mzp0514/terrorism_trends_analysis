He also said the suicide bomber has been identified as an Iranian national.\nThe attack killed 42 persons, including 15 members of Iran&apos;s elite Revolutionary Guards. Previous official figures had put the death toll of guard commanders as seven.\nThe arrests came as Iran stepped up pressure on Islamabad, stating that the group which launched the deadly week-end suicide-attack on its Revolutionary Guards commanders was based in Pakistan and had links with that country&apos;s intelligence agency, the ISI.\nIn a strongly worded statement, Tehran also demanded extradition of Abdolmalik Rigi, the chief of Pakistan-based Sunni group Jundallah, or Soldiers of God, and said that a high-level team would travel to Islamabad to present proof of the involvement of the group in the attack.\nMedia reports in Iran also quoted General Mohammad Ali Jafari, the Revolutionary Guards chief, as vowing to \"retaliate\" against U.S. and British intelligence agencies that he says helped the attackers.\nThe Pakistani, U.S. and British governments have condemned the attack and denied any involvement.\nMeanwhile, an Iranian lawmaker from the western city of Eslamabad-e Gharb has called on President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to freeze all financial aid to Pakistan. Islamabad was due to receive about $300 million in aid from Tehran, most of which was to be in the form of counter-terrorism assistance.\nAccusing the Pakistani Intelligence Agency (ISI) of being the main supporter of terrorism in the region, Heshmatollah Falahat-Pishe, a member of Iran&apos;s Parliamentary Committee on National Security and Foreign Policy said until Islamabad demonstrates its sincerity in controlling its borders, the country should be nor be provided any Iranian aid.\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\nCopyright(c) 2009 RTTNews.com, Inc.
