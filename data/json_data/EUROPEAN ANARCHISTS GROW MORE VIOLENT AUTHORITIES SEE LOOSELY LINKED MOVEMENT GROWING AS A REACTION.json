    "full text": "ROME -- A loosely linked movement of European anarchists who want to bring down state and financial institutions is becoming more violent and coordinated after decades out of the spotlight, and may be responding to social tensions spawned by the continent's financial crisis, security experts say.\nItalian police said Tuesday that letter bombs were sent to three embassies in Rome by Italian anarchists in solidarity with jailed Greek anarchists, who had asked their comrades to organize and coordinate a global \"revolutionary war.\"\nIdentical package bombs exploded at the Swiss and Chilean embassies in Rome on Dec. 23, badly wounding the two people who opened them. A third bomb was safely defused at the Greek Embassy on Monday.\n\"We're striking again, and we do so in response to the appeal launched by our Greek companions,\" the Italian group known as the Informal Anarchist Federation wrote in a claim of responsibility for the third bomb that was released by police in Rome Tuesday.\nExtreme left-wing and anarchist movements have existed for decades in Europe -- waging deadly attacks across the continent in the 1960s and 1970s that trailed and became sporadic in recent decades. Officials, meanwhile, focused far more intensely on the threat of Islamist terrorism.\nBut the European Union's police agency, Europol, reported this year that attacks by far-left and anarchist militant groups jumped by 43 percent in 2009 compared with the previous year, and more than doubled the number of attacks 2007, with most of the incidents in Italy, Spain and Greece. Spain and Greece have been hit particularly hard by government cutbacks and unemployment resulting from a continent-wide debt crisis. Italy has also been growing tense in recent months in response to austerity measures and a political duel between Premier Silvio Berlusconi and a former ally that for weeks threatened the government's survival.\nLast month, 14 letter bombs were mailed to embassies in Athens by a Greek group that urged stepped-up attacks by anarchists worldwide. Two of the devices exploded, causing no injuries.\n\"Anarchists-insurrectionists work to try to raise the level of clashes when there are problems\" said Marco Boschi, a criminologist who teaches a course on terrorism at the University of Florence and has written about anarchists. \"They exploit every occasion.\"\nA Greek group calling itself the Conspiracy Nuclei of Fire claimed responsibility for sending the 14 mail bombs in Athens. Panagiotis Argyros, 22 and Gerasimos Tsakalos, 24, were arrested on Nov. 1 in connection with the mailings and were charged with terrorism-related offenses. At least a dozen suspected members of their group are due to go on trial Jan. 17 for other offenses.\nThe Conspiracy Nuclei of Fire called on militants around Europe to step up their actions before the trial.\n\"We will organize internationally and take aim at the enemy. We can't wait to see the subversive elements flooding the streets and the guerrilla groups striking again and again,\" the group wrote.\nBut European anarchists are not always in step.\nThe solidarity boasted by the Italian anarchists who targeted the Rome embassies apparently irritated a Greek militant group, whose membership included Lambros Foundas, who was killed in a shootout with police in Athens earlier this year.\nThree imprisoned members of Revolutionary Struggle claimed in a communique Tuesday evening that their group never carries out actions \"that would result in the injury of someone, like a random embassy official.\" The Italian anarchists, in their claim of responsibility for the embassy bombs, said their cell was named after Mr. Foundas.\nItalian officials have said the Swiss Embassy was targeted by the latest attack in Italy because intensified Swiss-Italian cooperation led to two well-known arrests of anarchists.\nPolitical science professor Franco Pavoncello at Rome's John Cabot University said he didn't foresee a return to an era of leftist terror.\n\"If this were the anarchists' goal, they would not be focusing on embassies,\" he said.\nHe noted that no one really knows how many people are behind the group that claimed responsibility.\n\nLoad-Date: December 29, 2010"
