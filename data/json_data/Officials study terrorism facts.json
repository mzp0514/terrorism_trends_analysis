Jefferson, an instructor in the DeKalb County police training division, said the seminar helped him recognize the need to talk to recruits about spotting possible signs of terrorism. He said the department is developing a lesson plan that will include anti-terrorism awareness.\n\"These are the guys who will be our foot soldiers in the coming months, and they need to be made aware of what's out there,\" he said.\nSince Sept. 11, the demand for information about terrorism has grown, said instructor Barry Murner.\n\"You only have to look at the layout of a bookstore or local library to see how terrorism has already affected America,\" Murner said. \"Every one of them now has a terrorism section.\"\nThe course does not include classified information, Murner said. He said state officials hope the training program will be presented to local civic clubs and church groups.\n\"All of this information was already out there. We just pulled it together to help people connect the dots,\" Murner said. Still unknown, Murner said, is how much money will be available to Georgia cities and counties.\nEarly estimates had about $100 million, with 75 percent to local emergency agencies.\nThe requirement that three-quarters of the funds go to localities still holds, Murner said, but there is now a question, due to federal officials, regarding the amount to be received by first responders.\nStaff writer Eric Stirgus contributed to this article.\n\nLoad-Date: August 29, 2002"
