    "full text": "The Sept. 11 attacks have filtered into popular culture everywhere, even in corridos, the twangy ballads of northern Mexico. The music of corridos is traditional, but their lyrics tell gripping, contemporary tales: the exploits of borderland drug lords, say, or the travails of migrants to El Norte. Following are translated excerpts of two of the most recent.   SIMON ROMERO\n\n\"Black September\"\nBy Filogonio Contreras\nBlack 11th of September of our year 2001\nLike castles of playing cards\nThus fell the potent twins\nErasing thousands of innocent lives.\nThey destroyed the two towers\nSo central to finance. . . . \n\nIt seemed like a nightmare\nBoth women and men were crying.\nBodies were covered in flames\nAnd were jumping from windows.\n\nAnother plane in Pennsylvania\nCrashed in an empty field\nEveryone was burnt \nWith courage they resisted.\n\n\"The Ballad of Osama bin Laden\"\nBy Rigoberto Cardenas Chavez\n\nI am not God to judge you\nYou have your motives\nMoney seeks money\nAnd the gringos want you\nLike a treasure they are seeking\nThey will be made rich if they find you.\n\nNostradamus had foreseen it\nA dragon has risen\nThe beginning of the end of the world\nIs what we're watching unfold\nThe most perverse animal on Earth \nIs the human being. \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: November 18, 2001"
