    "full text": "To the Editor:\nAccording to \"American Forces and Terror Group Reach Cease-Fire\" (front page, April 29), American forces have negotiated a cease-fire with the People's Mujahedeen, a terrorist group. \nThis is quite disturbing. It has been longstanding official United States policy never to negotiate with terrorists. \n     Apparently, the reasoning is that since the group opposes the Iranian government, it will be allowed to continue operating. That does not bode well for the innocent civilians in Iraq and Iran who will continue to suffer because of this group's existence. \n This duplicitous action sends a very clear message that we support terrorism if we share the interests of the terrorist group. In other words, \"our\" terrorists are acceptable, but the terrorists used by those we disagree with must be removed.\nIf we condone terrorism in any form, terrorism will never be rooted out and innocent people will continue to suffer and die. If the Bush administration's objective was truly sincere, we would fight against all forms of terrorism, including state terrorism as a tool used by our allies and friends.\nThis action should be strongly opposed by our leaders because it goes against the core values that our nation espouses.\n\nRAYMOND LONG\nNew Canaan, Conn., April 29, 2003\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: April 30, 2003"
