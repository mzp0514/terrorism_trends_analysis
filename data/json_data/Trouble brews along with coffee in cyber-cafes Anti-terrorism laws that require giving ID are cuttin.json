His abductors used e-mail to send demands and photos.\nHowever, those messages were traced to a computer in a private home, not an Internet cafe. Pakistan does not require cyber-cafe users to register.\nDaniele Capezzone, a leader of Italy's Radical Party, which campaigns on human and civil rights issues, opposes the law.\nHe explained why he thinks it has stirred little debate: \"Two reasons: one, the political class isn't talking about it, and two, the media hasn't shined a light on it.\"\nCyber-cafe owners who rely in large part on a clientele that may not be in the country legally often opt to turn a blind eye.\n\"Fifty percent of the people who come for Internet don't want to show their document,\" Sohel said, opening his registry book and pointing to where a few clients among those who used the computers left their names but not their passport numbers. As for successfully photocopying IDs, he said customer compliance is rare.\nGiuseppe Italia, whose office at Rome's central police station oversees the application of the law in Rome, acknowledges that cyber-cafes that cater to immigrants might not be complying consistently.\nSabino Acquaviva, a sociologist at the University of Padua who specializes in terrorism, says compliance is haphazard. \"People either won't register their documents .o.o. or will show fake ones,\" he said. \"I think this law is useless.\"\n\nLoad-Date: December 28, 2005"
