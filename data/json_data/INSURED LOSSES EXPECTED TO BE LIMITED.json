The terrorism victim guarantee fund was established in 1986.\nWhile they caused tragic loss of life, the Nov. 13 attacks did not cause widespread insured property damage, said Richard Halstead, London-based terrorism line underwriter at Hiscox Ltd., which does not have exposure to any terrorism losses in the Paris attacks.\nThey do, however, underline the understanding that no country is completely safe from terrorism threats, he said.\nIn a statement, Pool Reinsurance Co. Ltd., the U.K. government-backed terrorism pool, said it had written to the Paris pool to express sympathy and offer support.\n\"Two weeks ago, terrorism reinsurance pools from around the world met in London to discuss ways of collaborating and learning from each other's experiences. None of us would have expected to have been faced with such terrible events so soon afterwards,\" it said.\n\"We will continue our efforts to encourage resilience at crowded places in this country\" by encouraging underwriters to apply discounted terrorism insurance rates for buyers that comply with a U.K. Home Office protective security improvement program, Pool Re said.\n\nLoad-Date: November 26, 2015"
