    "full text": "To the Editor:\nDaniel Schorr's review of my book ''Revolutionaries and Functionaries'' (May 1) seriously misconstrues my main argument. He asserts that I exempt the African National Congress from an indictment for terrorism because I approve of its goals.\nMy actual contention is that the A.N.C. has pursued tactics that have generally avoided violence against innocent civilians (as distinct from those engaged directly in the maintenance of apartheid) and therefore does not deserve to be regarded as a terrorist organization. Indeed, it is one of the important achievements of the A.N.C. to carry on its struggle without encroaching upon innocence despite repeated provocations by Pretoria.\nMy argument is that the core of terrorism consists of political violence against the innocent, no matter who the perpetrator or what the instrument. Political violence may also be condemned because it is illegal, immoral, imprudent. The recent Israeli execution of Abu Jihad in Tunisia was, by my analysis, indictable on these grounds, but not as terrorism. Abu Jihad was a legitimate target in an armed struggle between a revolutionary organization and an established government.\nMr. Schorr does the debate about terrorism a disservice by reducing it to a clash of ''left'' and ''right'' over opposing conceptions of who is a ''good terrorist'' (i.e., liberator or freedom fighter). My attempt was to find a way to get beyond these polemics and begin the difficult search for a constructive approach based on renouncing all tactics and instruments of armed struggle that do not respect innocence. This position is, of course, attackable on a number of grounds, and I would have vastly preferred a review that criticized what I did argue than the straw man Mr. Schorr chose to demolish!\n \nRICHARD FALK\n  Princeton, N.J."
