The hospital said he tested positive for COVID-19 after the surgery and his condition was critical.\nHe is accused by investigators of terrorism, arson, kidnap and murder, including against his own countrymen on Rwandan soil in two incidences in June and December 2018.\nHe was the real-life inspiration for the 2004 Hollywood film \"Hotel Rwanda\", starring Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo.\nRusesabagina, a critic of President Paul Kagame, moved overseas after the genocide and won worldwide acclaim, receiving the United States' highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 2005.\nAbout 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were butchered in 100 days in the central African nation from April 6, 1994.\nBut back home he has sparked outrage with warnings of another genocide, this time by Tutsis against Hutus.\nOnce championed in Western capitals as a reformer, Kagame has been criticised for overseeing constitutional changes to prolong his rule and cracking down on opposition voices.\n\nLoad-Date: August 31, 2020"
