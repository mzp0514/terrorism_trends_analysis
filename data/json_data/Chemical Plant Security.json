    "full text": "To the Editor:\n Before the formation of the Department of Homeland Security, responsibility for the nation's critical infrastructure was scattered over various federal agencies. Now one agency is responsible for coordinating the government's efforts to protect critical infrastructure across all sectors, including chemical facilities.\n We dispute your portrayal of new coordinated security measures, as well as the size of the population that could potentially be affected should an act of terrorism occur, in ''Facing the City, Potential Targets Rely on a Patchwork of Security'' (front page, May 9) and ''Chemical Time Bombs'' (editorial, May 10). The department has conducted visits and security reviews at all of the highest consequence chemical facilities in the New Jersey area and nationwide. \n Working with the department, facility operators have made considerable investments to enhance physical security at these facilities, including strengthening law enforcement coordination, improving access control, implementing detection technologies and increasing response preparedness capabilities. The department has identified high-consequence sites using a risk-based method incorporating wind direction rather than an outdated model that produced the highly exaggerated consequences cited in the article.\n While more work remains, the department continues to work closely with its federal, state, local, tribal and private sector partners to reduce the nation's vulnerability to acts of terrorism in the chemical sector.\n\nBob Stephan\nWashington, May 12, 2005\n\nThe writer is assistant secretary, Office of Infrastructure Protection, Department of Homeland Security.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: May 17, 2005"
