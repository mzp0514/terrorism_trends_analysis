    "full text": "A 1993 gunfire rampage at a five-star hotel in Cairo was a terrorist act that could have been prevented, a lawyer for the widows of two victims of the attack told a Manhattan jury yesterday.\nLawyer Harvey Weitz said the gunman shouted \"Allahu Akbar\" (God is Great) after the Oct. 26, 1993, bloodbath at the InterContinental hotel.\n\"He was there to kill Westerners,\" Weitz said in an opening statement in Manhattan Federal Court.\nThe gunman, Saber Farahat, killed four people who were dining in the hotel's restaurant, overlooking the Nile.\nThe victims included Robert Guidi, 47, of Rahway, N.J., and Coby Hoffman, also 47, of Edison, N.J., two engineers for a subsidiary of Brooklyn Union Gas (now KeySpan).\nTheir widows are suing the hotel, claiming that lax security enabled Farahat to slip past guards with a gun strapped to his body.\nWashington lawyer Merrill Kramer, 49, who was with Guidi and Hoffman on business, also is suing. He was critically wounded in the attack.\nDefense lawyer Alan Kaminsky said Egyptian authorities determined that Farahat was not a terrorist but a \"lone madman.\"\n\"This case is not about terrorism,\" he told the jury.\nFarahat was found mentally incompetent and was later released from a mental institution, Weitz said.\nIn 1997, armed with gasoline bombs, he attacked a bus loaded with tourists, killing nine Germans and their Egyptian driver. He was caught and executed.\nKaren Guidi and Eve Hoffman consoled each other as they heard the killings of their husbands recounted.\n\"It's much more emotional than I thought,\" said Guidi, 56. \"I thought I was ready for it, but I'm not.\"\nThe lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, was filed in 1995.\n\nLoad-Date: April 29, 2003"
