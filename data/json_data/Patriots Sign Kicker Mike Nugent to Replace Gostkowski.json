According to ESPN.com, the team has also made a decision to add Koo to the practice squad.\nDuring his 14 seasons with the team, Gostkowski had only missed time once before this, and that came in 2010 when he missed eight games. Hemost recently went 6-for-6 on field goals and 4-for-5 on extra points in six games with Oakland in 2018.\nThe Patriots likely will have rookie punter Jake Bailey handle kickoffs.\nNugent's signing was announced Thursday.\nHowever, Nugent hasn't been a team's full-time kicker since the 2016 season with the Cincinnati Bengals.\nVisa and Mastercard stand against Facebook's Libra\nAccording to reports on Bloomberg , the executives from the company have grown concerned on Facebook's involvement in Libra . There are also objections that have to do with privacy and possibly use for money laundering or financing of terrorism.\nNugent was among the series of place kickers who were in New England yesterday for a tryout after the Gostkowski move to IR, according to multiple reports.\nNugent is reportedly being brought in to replace long-time field-goal kicker Stephen Gostkowski who was placed on the injured reserve list after suffering a hip injury.\nNFL Network reporter Mike Garafolo tweeted that veteran Mike Nugent is expected to take over the kicking duties in Foxborough. That year, the team signed veteran Shayne Graham to fill in for the remainder of the season and he went a flawless 12 for 12 in field goal attempts, with a pair of unsuccessful extra points.\n\"I think it's going to cost them a Super Bowl\". This year he's missed four extra points.\n\nLoad-Date: October 7, 2019"
