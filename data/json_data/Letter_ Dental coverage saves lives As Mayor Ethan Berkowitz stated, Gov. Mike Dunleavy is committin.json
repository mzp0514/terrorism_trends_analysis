    "full text": "As Mayor Ethan Berkowitz stated, Gov. Mike Dunleavy is committing \"budgetary terrorism\" with his vetoes. Coverage about the impacts of Medicaid dental cuts particularly hit home. According to the Alaska Dental Society, inflammation in the teeth can exacerbate chronic conditions, affecting one's heart and other organs.\nSeveral years ago, my friend's infected, inflamed teeth contributed to a stroke. All of his teeth had to be pulled. Although he could suck fluids through a straw, he kept losing weight and did not begin to heal from the stroke until he got dentures and could eat solid foods again. \nLoss of state Medicaid funds means loss of federal Medicaid funds, which will mean death for some.\nAnchorage Faith Action Congregations Together, of which my church is a member, urges everyone to contact their legislators and protect Alaskans' lives and health by opposing these budget cuts. We can make a difference!\n- Cynthia Wentworth\nAnchorage\nHave something on your mind? Send toletters@adn.comor clickto submit via any web browser.
