The statement pledged the seven to fight terrorism through ''determined, tenacious, discreet and patient action combining national measures with international cooperation.''\nBut at the Oct. 27 meeting of the European ministers of foreign affairs in Luxembourg not six months later there was no action - discreet, patient or otherwise.\nBritain and its courageous Government were left out on a limb.\nGrand statements of policy are worthless unless followed by ''determined, tenacious, discreet and patient'' diplomacy, which has not been done on this important subject. The United States can send Gen. Vernon Walters on intermittent tours of European capitals to seek support for our antiterrorist measures, but this is not enough. We must map a strategy against terrorism, which our diplomats resident in capitals can promote every day, by private discussions with officials and leaders of public opinion, newspaper and magazine editors, business people, labor leaders and influential members of academic communities, including students.\nWe need more resourceful diplomats, and perhaps Britain as well, if we are to save civilization from the constant erosive effects of terrorism and its appeasement by the ''nervous Nellies'' of Western Europe. This diplomatic battle must be fought ''relentlessly and without compromise.''\n \nSMITH SIMPSON\n  Annandale, Va., Oct. 29, 1986\n \nThe writer is a retired Foreign Service officer."
