Poland commands 9,500 peacekeepers in Iraq, including 2,400 of its own, and the country's leaders have worried that the nation's role might also make it a target.\nThe men were taken into custody Sunday after Warsaw police spotted one of the Pakistanis behaving suspiciously near the capital's main train station and asked for his documents, police said.\nThe man said the documents were at his apartment. When police went there, they encountered two other Pakistanis and a Ukrainian man, police spokesman Marcin Szyndler said.\nA search of the premises turned up tourist maps of Poland with large parts of the city marked by wide circles, including around an area with the capital's only synagogue and an area housing many embassies, Szyndler said.\nHe emphasized that no individual sites were marked.\n\nLoad-Date: March 23, 2004"
