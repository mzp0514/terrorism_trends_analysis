    "full text": "BEIRUT, Lebanon -- A former minister in the Lebanese government convicted last year of terrorism-related charges was sentenced on Friday to 13 years in prison, Lebanon's official National News Agency said.\nThe arrest and trial of the former information minister, Michel Samaha, has transfixed Lebanon and shined a bright light on the deep fissures among its politicians, which have been deepened by five years of war in neighboring Syria. \n  Lebanon's weak government remains divided between allies of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and those who oppose him. Mr. Samaha is firmly in Mr. Assad's camp, and his trial has prompted accusations of judicial meddling in a country with a long history of political violence.\n  The Lebanese authorities arrested Mr. Samaha in 2012 and accused him of smuggling explosives into Lebanon from Syria for use in terrorist attacks. Named as an accomplice in the same suit was a high-ranking security official from Syria, Ali Mamlouk, who is close to Mr. Assad.\n  A Lebanese court sentenced Mr. Samaha in 2015 to four and a half years in prison, but he was released on bail early this year pending a retrial.\n  Many Lebanese were shocked that a man convicted of plotting terrorist attacks could be released on bail. Opponents of Syria accused Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group and ally of Mr. Assad, of intervening behind the scenes.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/09/world/middleeast/lebanon-michel-samaha-sentencing.html\n\nLoad-Date: April 9, 2016"
