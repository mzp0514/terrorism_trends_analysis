    "full text": "New Delhi: After the massive Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi's Nizamuddin has proved to be a super spreader of coronavirus, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad on Sunday demanded that the organisation be banned, and even alleged that it has terror links.\nIt alleged that \"after being indoctrinated from its Nizamuddin headquarters, hundreds of thousands of Tablighis are spreading obscurantism, wickedness and terrorism all over the world. Most of the founders of the world's terrorist organizations have also been associated with the Tablighi Jamaat.\"\nIt also demanded that the Nizamuddin Markaz buildings and its bank accounts be sealed forthwith and their financial sources be discovered. That's not all. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad asked for departmental proceedings against the \"guilty officers concerned\" who allowed this congregation to take place.\nThe entire country is \"stunned and disgusted with this inhuman behavior of the Tabighis and the radicals indoctrinated by them\", the VHP alleged while adding that the Tabhlighi Jamat is \"using the COVID-19 as a weapon\". \"The whole of India is in serious crisis today due to the country-wide criminal misdeeds of the Tablighi Jamaat and its Nizamuddin Markaz.\"\nVishwa Hindu Parishad's Central Joint General Secretary Dr. Surendra Jain said that the financial sources of the Tablighi Jamaat, that is endangering the lives of all Indians, should be probed and their bank accounts, offices and activities stopped at once.\n\nLoad-Date: April 7, 2020"
