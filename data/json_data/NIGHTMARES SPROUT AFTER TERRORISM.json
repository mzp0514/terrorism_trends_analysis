For New Yorker Sara Ridberg, sleep brought a vision of anthrax spilling on Central Park from a hot-air balloon.\nCalifornian Kelley Kolberg dreamed of a beautiful bald eagle, suddenly transformed into a snarling bird that flies away, leaving an apparition with glowing red eyes.\nThe all-too-real nightmares of life since Sept. 11 have caused many people to have bad dreams.\nEven people who don't usually have nightmares are experiencing them.\n\"They're feeling traumatized by what's going on,\" said Alan Siegel, a clinical psychologist from Berkeley, Calif., who wrote a book about dreams. \"But that's because the world is less secure than it was.\"\nFrom coast to coast, psychologists, dream researchers and sleep experts have noticed an uptick in the number of people seeking help for the dreams that have haunted their sleep since Sept. 11.\nNightmares dreams with an intense fear that wakes the sleeper are normal after a crisis. Having them suggests the dreamer is working through the trauma and accepting what happened.\n\"It's a way that our psyche has of getting through the shock and helping us to understand the world is very different,\" said Veronica Tonay, chairwoman of the Association for the Study of Dreams.\nDeen, who's never been to New York, dreamed of being at a new job in the World Trade Center and knowing the attacks were coming. But she went frantically in search of the date and until she found it, she could not warn anyone.\n\"I'm just trying to find out the date and no one can tell me,\" said Deen, 54, a medical transcriptionist in Medford, Ore. She woke up feeling anxious.\n\nLoad-Date: November 26, 2001"
