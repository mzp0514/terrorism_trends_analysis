A group calling themselves Deccan Mujahideen claimed responsibility for the mayhem. Locations hit included two major hotels, a train station and a hospital. By Friday evening, at least nine gunmen had been killed and one arrested, according to The Associated Press.\nUW-Stout assistant professor of English and philosophy Lopa Basu, a native of India, said she believes any impact on tourism will be short term.\n\"Mumbai is too vital of city,\" she said.\nBasu's family, including her parents and sister, live in India. Her sister lives in the suburbs of Mumbai, and all are well, Basu said.\n\"It is horrific,\" she said of the attacks. \"Nothing like this has ever happened in India before.\"\nThere have been terrorist attacks, but not at this scale with this many people killed and injured.\nIn Kashmir, foreign tourists have been kidnapped to gain media attention, which has cut tourism travel there, said Basu, who has taught at UW-Stout for four years and lived in the U.S. for 14 years.\nTo see more of the Leader-Telegram or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.leadertelegram.com/.
