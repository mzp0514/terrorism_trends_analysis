    "full text": "FORT MYERS, Fla. - Rallying huge crowds of their own volunteers and voters, President Bush and Sen. John Kerry on Saturday each claimed to be the only candidate ready to lead America in the fight against terrorism.\nAccompanied by five Marine helicopters, Bush landed in left field of a Fort Myers stadium used for spring practice by Kerry's hometown baseball team, the Boston Red Sox. Bush told about 10,000 raucous fans that the Democrat's presidency could endanger America.\nMocking a Kerry adviser who called the \"war on terrorism\" a metaphor akin to the \"war on poverty,\" Bush said, \"Anyone who thinks we are fighting a metaphor does not understand the enemy we face.\"\nBush accused Kerry of contradicting his own positions on Iraq. While Kerry now criticizes the war as ill-advised and improperly run, Bush said that before the campaign, Kerry agreed that Saddam Hussein was a threat. \"Senator Kerry seems to have forgotten all of that,\" said Bush. \"You might call it election amnesia.\"\nBush campaigned at sports venues in Lakeland, Melbourne and Jacksonville before flying to his ranch in Texas Saturday night.\nKerry, campaigning in Colorado, told an energized crowd of 10,000 that he had serious reservations about Bush's ability to wage a war on terrorism while simultaneously promoting familyfriendly economic policies.\n\"A president has to be able to do more than one thing at the same time,\" Kerry said.\n\nLoad-Date: October 30, 2004"
