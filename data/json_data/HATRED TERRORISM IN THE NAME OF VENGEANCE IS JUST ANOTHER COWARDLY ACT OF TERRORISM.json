    "full text": "THE bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City was a\nhateful act. The nation mourns with Oklahoma City the loss of more\nthan a hundred people, including dozens of children _ infants, really\nFollowing the explosion, rumors ran wild.\nMuslims were said to\nbe behind the attack.  That was an error that arose from prejudice\n.  It was deadly.\nThe home of a pregnant Muslim woman in Oklahoma City was stoned\n.  The mother miscarried.  The child, stillborn, was buried on Monday\nThe family had moved to Oklahoma from Iraq to escape Saddam\nHussein's persecution of Shiite Muslims.\nIn London, Abraham Ahmad was taken from his plane en route to\nJordan and sent back to Oklahoma.  His only crime was being Muslim at\na time when Muslims were falsely accused of a horrific crime.\n\"I was treated like dirt, like a dog,\" Ahmad said.  \"I was\njudged guilty because of what I look like.\"\nThis is madness, too, like the madness behind the bombing.\nSomeone thought his beliefs were so correct that he had the right to\nkill children.\nMobs thought they had a right to avenge those deaths by\nattacking a hapless pregnant woman.\nThis is a time of mourning in America.  Those who use this time\nto plot vengeance still do not get it. The very hate that fueled the\nexplosion in Oklahoma burns in their hearts.\nAmerica must let its justice system prevail.\nThe Department of Justice must prosecute everyone involved\ncriminally in the bombing in Oklahoma City.  Authorities also should\npursue those whose actions led to the stillborn death of a Muslim\nbaby.-30-\n\nLoad-Date: April 27, 1995"
