    "full text": "LONDON -- As the British government introduced a new counterterrorism law on Wednesday to increase surveillance on people suspected of involvement in jihad, two British brothers were jailed for conspiring to attend a terrorist training camp in Syria and unlawfully possessing ammunition.\nThe brothers, Hamza and Mohommod Nawaz, were arrested last year while returning from Syria through France. The police say they were carrying ammunition brought home as a trophy and photographs of the training camp they attended. Hamza Nawaz, 23, was sentenced Wednesday to three years in prison and his brother, Mohommod, 31, described as the instigator of the plan, to four and a half years. There was no indication that either man took part in any fighting or intended to attack any targets in Britain.\nThe law put before Parliament would allow the police to suspend the passports of Britons who travel or seek to travel abroad for jihad and prevent those who do so from re-entering the country for two years unless they agreed to strict monitoring.\nThe contentious legislation would also require Internet service providers to hand over data to trace individual smartphone and computer users suspected of plotting to become jihadis. On Tuesday, British officials criticized Internet technology companies for not warning the authorities about Facebook postings from a man who went on to kill a British soldier, Lee Rigby.\nThis is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/27/world/europe/british-brothers-imprisoned-terrorist-training-camp-syria.html\n\nLoad-Date: November 27, 2014"
