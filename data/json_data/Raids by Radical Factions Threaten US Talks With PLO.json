    "full text": "THE US is worried that operations into Israel conducted by more-radical factions within the PLO will endanger its talks with the organization.\nWashington has been deliberately ambiguous in defining what type of attack constitutes terrorism.\nIt has not labeled as terrorism the three recent attempts at cross-border operations from Lebanon by PLO factions. Rather, US messages to the PLO have stressed that all armed attacks undermine the goal of building Israeli confidence in the PLO's peaceful intentions. The messages also warned that if one of these attacks kills civilians, whatever the intended target, it could force the US to stop the dialogue.\nThe last attempted infiltration 10 days ago by members of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) came the closest yet to forcing the US's hand: It was aimed at a target within an Israeli settlement, the US official says.\nWashington has also told the Israeli government to ease up on its drive to stop the US-PLO dialogue.\nUS officials acknowledge that PLO chairman Yasser Arafat doesn't control the DFLP and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which launched the operations. Mr. Arafat's Fatah faction, they add, has not attempted any infiltrations.\nArafat has skirted US requests that he discipline the attackers or at least denounce their actions. But he has responded to US concerns by repeating his opposition to terrorism - as distinct from attacks on military targets and demonstrations that are part of the intifadah on the West Bank and Gaza. He has also called for a truce between the PLO and Israel in southern Lebanon as existed in 1981. US officials say they are intrigued by this idea."
