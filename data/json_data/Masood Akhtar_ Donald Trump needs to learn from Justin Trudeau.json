    "full text": "Dear Editor: Immediately after the Quebec city mosque shooting, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the shooting a \"terrorist attack on Muslims.\"  Trudeau even didn't wait to see who the shooter was or what his religion was. He wasted no time in calling it terrorism. This is how you treat people of your country with respect and dignity and treat them as equal partners in fighting terrorism.\nOn the other hand in the United States, the shooter is immediately called a terrorist only when he is a Muslim. In fact we go beyond calling him a Muslim - we always associate him with his religion and call him an \"Islamic terrorist.\" Terrorists use this double standard of ours to recruit more terrorists. The executive order recently issued by President Donald Trump banning Muslims from seven Muslim countries from entering into the United States is another example of a tool terrorists would utilize to recruit more terrorists, making America unsafe. Instead of Trump calling Trudeau and offering condolences, our president should learn from Trudeau how to treat people of our own country with respect and dignity and partner with them to deal with terrorism, making us safe.\nMasood Akhtar \nMiddleton\nSend your letter to the editor to tctvoice@madison.com Include your full name, hometown and phone number.
