    "full text": "As a candidate, President-elect Donald Trump famously promised not only to use the phrase but also to fight \"radical Islamic terrorism.\" Yet as his administration comes together, it's getting harder to make the distinction between that fight and outright Islamophobia.\nReligious prejudice should have no place in American life. Moreover, claiming that \"fear of Muslims is rational\" -- as has Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump's selection as national security adviser -- makes the fight against terrorism more difficult, and distracts from equally profound challenges facing the U.S.\nTrump himself has said \"Islam hates us,\" while he and several underlings have called for a registry for all Muslims in the U.S. (the fate of this proposal is now uncertain). His adviser Stephen Bannon compares the fight against terrorism to medieval Christendom's fight against the Turks.\nPurely from a practical standpoint -- again, leaving aside moral or constitutional qualms -- these views are profoundly unhelpful. Islam is the world's second-largest and fastest-growing faith, encompassing one-quarter of its population and divided among numerous sects. Overwhelming majorities of the world's Muslims reject violence against civilians in the name of Islam.\nThese are exactly the people whose help is most necessary in fighting the threat of Islamic terrorism -- and this is exactly the rhetoric most likely to alienate them. Such language also feeds Islamic State's narrative that the West will never accept Muslims living in their midst and weakens the best line of defense against radicalization: the willingness of communities to police themselves and report suspicious activity.\nFinally, the incoming administration's stance is encouraging to autocrats such as Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi, who says he wants to reform Islam, and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who praised Trump as a \"natural ally.\" But stiffer repression (in Egypt) or continued war crimes (in Syria) will not dim the allure of violent jihad.\nThe only thing that will do that is support for better governance, more economic opportunity, greater political freedom and stronger, more open communities. These are values the U.S. has long stood for and they remain worth defending no matter who is president.\nBloomberg View (Nov. 23)\n\nLoad-Date: November 24, 2016"
