Intelligence agency chiefs from Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and Spain are scheduled to meet Monday in a bid to spur closer cooperation among them.\nThe scale of the challenge they face has become clearer from patterns that investigators have discerned in the wake of the Madrid bombings, leading them in several directions across Europe and North Africa as they follow links that the central suspect, the Moroccan Jamal Zougam, may have forged with Islamic militants.\nSpanish police tapped a phone call that Mr. Zougam made in August 2001 to Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas, currently jailed in Spain following his indictment last year by judge Balthazar Garzon, who suspects him of having been the head of Al Qaeda's cell in Spain.\nZougam was heard to say he had met and offered financial aid to Mohamed Fizazi. Mr. Fizazi is believed to be the spiritual leader of Salafiyah Jihadiyah, a Moroccan extremist group. He was found guilty by a Moroccan court last year of involvement in May's suicide bombings that killed 44 people in Casablanca, and was jailed for 30 years.\nZougam had come under investigation by the Spanish police at the request of the French authorities, who had found his name in an address book belonging to David Courtailler, a French convert to Islam who went on trial in Paris last week on charges of terrorist association. Mr. Courtailler's brother, Jerome, was acquitted in 2002 of plotting an attack on the US embassy in Paris. David Courtailler once shared an apartment with Zacharias Moussaoui, the only person so far charged in the United States in connection with the World Trade Center attack.\nZougam also visited Mullah Krekar, an Iraqi Kurdish exile, according to Judge Garzon's 600,000 page investigation of Al Qaeda activities in Spain. Mr. Krekar founded the Kurdish group that became Ansar al-Islam and is accused by US intelligence officials of ordering attacks on US troops in Iraq.\nAmong alleged terrorist leaders believed to have worked with Ansar al-Islam is Abu Musab Zarqawi, founder of the Jordanian radical Islamist Al Tawhid group, which German police have said is now active among Middle Eastern exiles in Germany and Italy, seeking recruits to fight US forces in Iraq and planning attacks in western Europe.\nGroups such as Ansar, the Salafists, al-Tawhid, and others like them around Europe, North Africa. and the Middle East are loosely federated in the \"World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders,\" which Mr. bin Laden set up in 1998, says Gunaratna. But they act on their own initiative, drawing on their members' personal connections as necessary.\n\"The ones who give orders are harder to identify,\" says Mr. Brisard. \"As the Al Qaeda leadership has suffered, new more local, regional leaders have sprung up.\"\nThese leaders - and the plotters they command - are not always invisible, and western intelligence agencies have scored some notable successes.\nAmong an estimated 20 or so planned Islamist terrorist operations in Europe that have been thwarted in recent years were plots to blow up a Christmas market in Strasbourg, to attack Western shipping in the Straits of Gibraltar, to kill US airmen at a base in Belgium, to release the poison ricin in Britain, and to bomb the US embassy in Paris.\n\"It is not humanly possible to stop everything,\" however, says Daniel Benjamin, a former National Security Council counterterrorism chief and author of \"The Age of Sacred Terror.\" \"We can beat them 20 times, but if they beat us once, it makes it look like they are winning.\"\n(c) Copyright 2004.
