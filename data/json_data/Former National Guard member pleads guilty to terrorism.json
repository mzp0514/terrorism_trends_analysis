    "full text": "An Aurora man who authorities say intended to travel to the Middle East to fight for ISIS pleaded guilty Monday in federal court to conspiring to support foreign terrorists.\nAs part of a negotiated plea agreement, Hasan Edmonds, a former member of the Army National Guard of Illinois, pleaded guilty to conspiring to provide material support and attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization.\nWhen he is sentenced on March 18, Edmonds, 23, faces up to 30 years in prison and a maximum fine of $500,000, according to the plea agreement. U.S. District Judge John Z. Lee, however, is not bound by that agreement.\nAssistant U.S. Attorney John Kness said the plea agreement \"does not reflect any cooperation\" from Edmonds in this or any other matter.\nLast week Hasan Edmonds' cousin Jonas Edmonds, 30, pleaded guilty to conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist and to making false statements to a federal officer regarding an offense involving international terrorism. Jonas Edmonds' plea agreement calls for a total sentence of 21 years in prison.\nHis sentencing is set for Jan. 27.\nAuthorities say the cousins began conspiring to provide support, mostly personnel, to ISIS.\nHasan Edmonds began communicating online in January 2015 with someone he believed was an ISIS fighter in Libya but who was really an undercover FBI agent, said Kness.\nHasan Edmonds expressed to the undercover agent his interest in traveling to the Middle East to fight with the group, while Jonas Edmonds told the undercover agent if he was unable to travel to support ISIS, he would carry out an attack in the United States instead, Kness said.\n\nLoad-Date: December 15, 2015"
