Newport News, with its heavy concentration of Naval ships, planes and personnel, qualifies as a high-risk area, said Lt. Col. Bill Darley, a Department of Defense spokesman.\nAnd while military bases make the city strategically important to international terrorists, there's a growing concern about a much more subtle threat, Darley said: the guy next door with the capacity to mix chemicals and viruses in his garage.\nMilitary-heavy localities like Newport News began to raise their guard after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and the 1996 Olympic Park incident in Atlanta. And their watchfulness increased further after the Aug. 7 bombing of two U.S. embassies in Africa and the American military's response strike in Afghanistan and the Sudan.\nBut still, city officials said, they haven't given too much thought to the possibility of a terrorist incident so close to home.\n\"That's not one of the things we have addressed in our emergency plan,\" said Newport News Assistant City Manager Randy Hildebrandt. \"We would be more likely to prepare for natural disasters. . . . I suppose we've never specifically looked at responses to terrorism.\"\nThey will now.\n\nLoad-Date: September 26, 1998"
