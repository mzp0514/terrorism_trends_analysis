Green at the bottom signals a low danger of attack and red at the top warns of a severe threat. It was put in place after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and was designed to help emergency responders get prepared.\nBut it's been criticized by Republicans and Democrats alike for being too vague to deliver enough useful information.\nHomeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced the review Tuesday by a panel of 17 people that include Democrats and Republicans, mayors, governors, police executives, and public and private security experts. It is a balanced group clearly designed to not only evaluate the alert system but also to provide political cover from critics for any changes to the color-coded system.\n\"My goal is simple: To have the most effective system in place to inform the American people about threats to our country,\" Napolitano said. Want to sound off?\nThe Homeland Security Department will accept public comment on the system.
