In 2002, at the Kananaskis summit in Canada, the G-8 leaders announced that Russia would host the 2006 summit --- heralding Russia's membership in the powerful group.\nBut despite formal acceptance, Russia still battles the image of belonging to an organization for which it's not necessarily qualified: The country is not one of the world's eight largest economies, which the term G-8 is supposed to connote.\nEconomically, Russia is still decades behind the other G-8 members, judging by such indicators as GDP per capita --- $2,140 compared to $21,500 for Italy, the next closest. In terms of life expectancy, Russian males live to 62 compared to 76 for Canada.\nLacking economically\nRussia is still not invited to participate in the meeting of finance ministers from the other seven members of the group --- a reflection of the fact that when it comes to issues such as currency policy or aid, Russia is not economically strong enough to contribute to or influence those decisions.\nBut its economy is growing; in 2003, gross domestic product rose by 7.3 percent. And Alexander Livshits, Russia's representative to the G-8 under Yeltsin, points out that with the world's largest natural gas reserves and the eighth largest oil reserves, Russia is a force to be reckoned with in the energy marketplace.\nAt the June summit, Putin is also expected to highlight the war against terrorism --- specifically Chechnya. After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist strikes in the United States, Moscow has made headway in bringing the rest of the world, especially Washington, around to its view that the war in Chechnya is directly tied to the international war against terrorism.\nRussia has been fighting the insurgency in the breakaway Chechen republic on its southern borders since 1999 and increasingly, Chechen rebels have been resorting to suicide bomb attacks.\nAt Sea Island, experts say, Putin will push for greater cooperation from other countries in gathering intelligence on Chechen leaders and halting their financing. Putin, they say, will also seek to remind G-8 leaders about the threat of terrorism and Islamic extremism in Central Asia.\nRussia, however, may balk at signing on to President Bush's Proliferation Security Initiative.\nU.S. officials proposed the plan --- which aims to increase international efforts to stop illegal air, sea and ground shipments of materials and equipment used to make nuclear, biological or chemical weapons --- last May.\nThey say Russia has reservations about the legal basis of seizing planes or boats believed to be carrying such materials.\nOn the economic front, Putin is expected to lobby hard for more progress on Russia's entry into the World Trade Organization. Russia is the only member of the G-8 that is not also a member of the WTO.\nClose eye on EU\nOne of the main stumbling blocks has been the fact that Russia sells its natural gas to European Union countries at a higher price than it does domestically. EU countries decry this as an unfair advantage for Russian companies while Moscow says raising domestic prices would hurt millions of Russian consumers.\nFor Putin, says Sergei Karaganov, a foreign policy adviser to the Russian president, the Sea Island summit presents a chance to assess whether EU leaders are really serious about Russian membership in the WTO.\n\"We would be very interested in looking in their eyes and seeing how their statements of support for Russia joining the WTO correspond to the official policies of their minor bureaucrats sitting in Brussels [EU headquarters] and negotiating with Russia, which are becoming less and less constructive,\" said Karaganov.\nOne issue that could cast a cloud over Russia at the summit will be questions about Putin's commitment to democratic principles.\nThe Russian leader has come under heavy international criticism over the Dec. 7 parliamentary elections and the March 14 presidential ballot, which international observers said were skewed in favor of Putin and the United Russia party that he favors.\nAn ongoing scandal surrounding one of Russia's wealthiest businessmen, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, has also given rise to accusations that Russia under Putin is returning to repressive Soviet-era tactics.\nLast October, Khodorkovsky, who used to head Russia's largest oil company, Yukos, was jailed after masked security agents stormed his plane. The case is viewed by many as an attempt to cut the oil magnate down to size after he began financing opposition political groups.\nAfter Khodorkovsky's arrest, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) called for Russia's ouster from the G-8. McCain, with Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.), sponsored a resolution in the Senate that would suspend Russia's membership in the G-8 for failing to adhere to democratic principles.\nAt home, however, the summit is likely to burnish Putin's credentials as the man who has put Moscow back on the global stage. A recent poll conducted by the Moscow-based Levada Center found that 72 percent of respondents credited Putin with strengthening Russia's international position.\nIn another poll by the same agency, 58 percent said the most important role of the president is to return Russia to the status of a great power.\nThat's why, says G-8 expert Kirton, Russia is looking forward to hosting the 2006 summit.\n\"It would be basically a declaration of victory that Russia is back as a generally great power,\" he said.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPhoto: FEATURED ISSUE: DEMOCRACY\nAn elderly Russian woman casts her ballot papers at home in Moscow in March.

The Communists under Vladimir Lenin seized power soon after and formed the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Josef Stalin took over from Lenin in 1928.  The Soviet Union was an ally of the United States in World War II, but the postwar period saw the two superpowers engaged in a Cold War. Mikhail Gorbachev's rise to power in 1985 saw the beginning of the end of the Soviet empire and Communism. By December 1991, the Soviet Union splintered into 15 independent republics.\nG-8 REPRESENTATIVE\nPRESIDENT: Vladimir Putin\nPOLITICAL PARTY: United Russia\nVladimir Putin has been president of Russia since Dec. 31, 1999. A former official of the KGB, the Soviet spy agency, Putin and President Bush, himself the son of a former CIA director, have a friendly personal relationship that has survived the strains imposed on it when Putin refused to back the U.S.-led war on Iraq.\nECONOMY: Russia is still struggling to establish a modern market economy. Oil, natural gas, metals and timber account for more than 80 percent of exports. A dilapidated industrial infrastructure, a weak banking system, corruption and widespread lack of trust in institutions add to Russia's problems.\nGROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT PER CAPITA: $9,700 (2002 est.)\nUNEMPLOYMENT RATE: 7.9% (2002)\nCURRENCY: 1 Russian ruble = 3 U.S. cents\nTOURISM (2003)\nVisitors to United States from Russia: 62,330\nCULTURAL FACTS\nTOP OF THE MUSIC CHARTS\n1. \"Not In Love,\" by Enrique Iglesias (left)\n2. \"Dudu,\" by Tarkan\n3. \"Shut Up,\" by Black Eyed Peas\nFAMOUS RUSSIANS\n1.
