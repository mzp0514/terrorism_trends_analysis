    "full text": "Another week, another terrorist bombing? It certainly must have felt that way to Londoners on Thursday as attacks on their transport system echoed those of exactly two weeks earlier. Right down to the same pattern: three subway trains, one bus. Fortunately, this time it was a bungled job -- one person injured in minor explosions, not the 56 dead and scores wounded of 7/7.\nBut there's little doubt that no matter who the perpetrators -- Sick copycats? Another al-Qaeda cell? -- they reinforced the reality that this sort of attack represents a \"new normal\" of terrorism, one that has gradually been taking hold since the spectacular jets-as-bombs attacks on the USA on 9/11 almost four years ago.\nNew normals are situations that people adapt to. History and the present day offer up awe-inspiring examples. The Holocaust. The sacrifices of both World Wars. The everyday reality of Iraq. And, now, the gritty determination of Londoners since 7/7 to keep going, not to be scared away from public transport.\nBut in order to fight back effectively, more is needed than bravely adapting. The right questions also need constantly updating. Three, in particular, are relevant as the latest attacks further shape today's landscape:\nHow to keep fear in check?\nEach successive attack can build up disproportionate fear: Thursday's small blasts, for example, would not have gained nearly so much attention without the deadly explosions two weeks earlier. Fear can change behaviors. From minor ways, such as no longer taking subway trains. To the major: a vote in Spain, after their own terrorist attacks last year, to change governments and withdraw troops from Iraq as the terrorists demanded. British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Thursday captured the most effective, if hardly easy, reaction: \"We have just got to react calmly.\" London has. Americans must, as well.\nIs al-Qaeda changing strategy?\nUntil now, al-Qaeda has concentrated on spectacular attacks that take years of planning, as 9/11 did. Many lesser attacks around the world are now linked to al-Qaeda, including 7/7. Does this augur a change? If so, why? It could be good news: that efforts to get hold of the next level of weapons -- nuclear, chemical, biological -- are failing, in part because of the international effort against the organization. Equally, the explanation could be that it has grown into so many cells that both kinds of attack are being planned.\nAre we fighting back smartly enough?\nThe British response offers a hopeful example of how to keep on the right track. Through painstaking forensics, intelligence and tips from Muslim communities, the four 7/7 suicide bombers have been identified, several suspected accomplices have been arrested, including in Pakistan. Britain is also wrestling with new ways of tackling the roots of radicalism. It is tightening up laws that allow radical clerics to enter the country then incite terrorism. Most important, it's reaching out to Muslims in innovative ways, including, possibly, with an international conference of Muslim leaders. Nothing in the war on terrorism is more important than employing every tool to ally moderate Muslims unequivocally against the terrorists. Also, the British response has been surgically precise, unlike the post 9/11 spasm that fed a needless rush to war in Iraq.\nFor now, the new normal raises far more questions than answers, but they are key to coming to grips with terrorism. Beginning with not giving into the debilitating emotion that Franklin D. Roosevelt once singled out in different circumstances: \"fear itself.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO, B/W, Sang Tan, AP\n\nLoad-Date: July 22, 2005"
