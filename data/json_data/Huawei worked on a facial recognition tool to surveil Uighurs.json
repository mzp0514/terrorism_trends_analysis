Beijing has consistently denied mistreatment and says the camps are created to stamp out terrorism and improve employment opportunities.\nGriezmann's decision followed a report here in the Washington Post on December 8 that alleged thatHuawei had tested software capable of sending automated alerts when surveillance cameras recognised members of the mainly Muslim minority Uighur group.\nHuawei worked on a facial recognition system to snoop on people fromChina's Uighur community, which also had an \"Uighur alarm\" - to detect a person's ethnicity, and alert authorities upon spotting a person from the Uighur community, a report from video surveillance researchers IPVM claimed. According to documents uncovered by IPVM, the system was built usingHuawei cloud infrastructure and tools built by Chinese artificial intelligence firm Megvii. We do not provide custom algorithms or applications.\nWho Is Dr. Rochelle Walensky? Meet Biden's CDC Director Pick\nIf his name sounds familiar, it's because Murthy previously held the post from 2014 to 2017 under the Obama-Biden administration. Walensky responds to Biden's selection by saying that she is deeply honored to be selected for the lead position at the CDC.\nAHuawei spokesperson told the BBC that \"the language used in the document\" referred to in the report was \"completely unacceptable\".\nIPVM also clarified that it wasn't clear whetherHuawei and Megvii ever actually deployed the software.\nA Megvii spokesman also acknowledged that the document discovered by IPVM is genuine but said that the \"company's systems are not created to target or label ethnic groups\".\nChina responded furiously, with state TV pulling an Arsenal fixture from TV schedules.\n\nLoad-Date: December 11, 2020"
