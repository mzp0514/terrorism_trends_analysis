    "full text": "So suspicious are many around the world right now that when mortars were firedat the British prime minister's home at 10 Downing Street, most assumed at first that the attack was launched by Saddam Hussein's terrorist cells.  Apparently the attack was not related to the Persian Gulf War.\nWithin hours of the daring, daylight attack that fortunately left no one dead, the Irish Republican Army claimed credit.  It's not far-fetched to surmise that the IRA and Saddam Hussein would be working together. Terrorist groups have been known to help each other out, in training, supplies, safe houses and even operations. This is a time of increased terrorist attacks on U.S. and Western businesses such as airlines, travel and credit card offices. Bombs have been exploding all across Europe, including cities, like Athens, that would seem to have no particular ''guilt'' in terms of supporting the U.N. actions in the gulf. But Greece has long had a reputation as an easy place for terrorists to work; perhaps they find the climate appealing for sending a message.  So far - and this could change momentarily - attacks have caused few deaths and few injuries. Whether that is the result of terrorists' intent or preventive police work is not known yet.  Security police in democracies have a special burden: They must prevent terrorist attacks, but they must also respect basic rights while doing so.  Thus, the FBI must be especially careful to avoid harassing Arabs living in the United States or violating their privacy. It is easy to justify civil rights violations in times of national stress, but that is the very time the Constitution's protections take on a special relevance.\n\nLoad-Date: October 8, 1993"
