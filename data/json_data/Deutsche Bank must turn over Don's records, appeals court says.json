    "full text": "President Trump lost a bid Tuesday to block Congressional committees from obtaining financial records from his longtime lender, Deutsche Bank.\nThe 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the subpoenas from the House's Financial Services Committee and Intelligence Committee were well within Congress's authority. The committee also served subpoenas seeking Trump-related records from Capital One Bank.\n\"The public interest in vindicating the Committees' constitutional authority is clear and substantial. It is the interest of two congressional committees ... to obtain information on enforcement of anti-money-laundering/counter-financing of terrorism laws, terrorist financing, the movement of illicit funds through the global financial system including the real estate market, the scope of the Russian government's operations to influence the U.S. political process, and whether [Trump] was vulnerable to foreign exploitation,\" Judge Jon Newman wrote for the majority in the 2-1 decision. \nTrump sued Deutsche Bank and Capital One in his personal capacity, seeking to block them from complying with the subpoenas. He has seven days to appeal to the Supreme Court before the banks must turn over the records, which do not include Trump's tax returns.\n\"We believe the subpoena is invalid as issued. In light of the 2nd Circuit decision, we are evaluating our next options including review at the Supreme Court of the United States,\" Trump attorney Jay Sekulow said in a statement.\n\nLoad-Date: December 5, 2019"
