To improve security for Foreign Service personnel, 39 percent favored increasing the physical security of embassies, 27 favored decreasing the number of people assigned to dangerous areas, 27 favored improving intelligence capability, and only 9 favored retaliating against terrorists.\nThe survey questions were printed in the March issue of the magazine, whose 8,000 subscribers are largely active and retired Foreign Service officers, and the results appeared in the current issue."
