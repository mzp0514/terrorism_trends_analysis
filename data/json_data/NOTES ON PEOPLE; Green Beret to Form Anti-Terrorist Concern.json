Charlie A. Beckwith, said in Fort Bragg, N.C., yesterday that he would set up the company, which will have headquarters in Austin, Tex., after his retirement in the fall.\nCol Charlie Beckwith plans to form company to help corporations fight terrorist activitiesHe will be joined by five associates with whom he has worked in antiterrorist activities. The colonel declined to give their names.\n''All of us old soldiers have to leave military service sooner or later,'' said Colonel Beckwith, who is 52 years old. ''I feel this way I'll still be of service, helping others, helping the country.''\nHe said his new company, to go into operation by Oct. 1, would advise corporate executives on protecting themselves from attack and counsel them on preventing sabotage and terrorist attacks.\nIn the April 1980 mission to Iran in which Colonel Beckwith took part, three helicopters developed mechanical troubles. After the mission had already been aborted, a fourth helicopter crashed into a transport plane that had brought some of the men into Iran, killing eight servicemen.\nColonel Beckwith is currently assigned to the Joint Special Operations Command at Fort Bragg, a secrecy-shrouded unit that plans special operations for the four military services.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nIllustrations: photo of Col.
