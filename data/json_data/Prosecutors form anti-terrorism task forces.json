    "full text": "Iowa's two U.S. attorneys each have formed task forces to coordinate anti-terrorism efforts.\nAttorney General John Ashcroft directed that the task forces be formed to help coordinate the dissemination of information and the development of investigative and prosecuting strategy in dealing with terrorism.\nInga Bumbary-Langston, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Iowa, appointed prosecutor Stephen Patrick O'Meara to head the task force coordinator in her office. Charles Larson Sr., U.S. attorney for Iowa's Northern District, appointed prosecutor Robert Teig to head the task force in Cedar Rapids.\nThe two Iowa groups met jointly this week in a video conference, but it's unclear if they will operate jointly, said Al Overbaugh, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Des Moines.\nOther representatives on the task force are from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the U.S. Marshals Service, the Secret Service, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Postal Inspection Service, Internal Revenue Service, Social Security Administration, Iowa State Patrol and Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation.\nIn related news:\n* The Iowa Firemen's Association plans a memorial service at the Iowa Firefighters Memorial at 2 p.m. Sept. 30 to honor firefighters and police officers killed in the terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center.\nThe public is welcome to attend.\nThe association also has established an IFA Help fund to collect money for families of the fallen firefighters. Contributions may be sent to IFA Help, in care of Iowa Firemen's Association Treasurer Mike Reuman, P.O. Box 7, Traer, Iowa 50675.\n* Last week's terrorist attacks prompted a reunion of rescue and morgue workers who responded to the fiery crash of United Airlines Flight 232 in Sioux City in July 1989.\nThey held a prayer service Thursday evening.\nMarliss DeJong, regional director for Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, worked in the morgue helping to keep track of the paperwork identifying the 112 people who were killed in the Flight 232 crash.\n\"We experienced the heartache, the sadness and the difficult job that they have to do,\" she said. \"It is 50 times worse in New York.\"\n* The Iowa Air National Guard's 133rd Air Squadron is being called to support the nation's military strike at terrorism, said Guard spokesman Col. Bob King on Friday.\nThe exact start date and duration of the mobilization has not been determined, King said in a statement. The unit, based in Fort Dodge, has about 125 officers and airmen.\nDetails are being coordinated by the Air Combat Command at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia.\nThe unit's mission is to test and evaluate air defense command and control systems, King said.\n\nLoad-Date: September 27, 2001"
