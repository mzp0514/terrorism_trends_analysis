He was to be arraigned later Sunday.\n\"This is just another example of New York City because we are an iconic city . . . this is a city that people would want to take away our freedoms gravitate to and focus on,\" Bloomberg said.\nPolice Commissioner Raymond Kelly said a confidential informant had numerous conversations with Pimentel on Sept. 7 in which he expressed interest in building small bombs and targeting banks, government and police buildings.\nPimentel also posted on his website trueislam1.com and on blogs his support of al-Qaida and belief in jihad, and promoted an online magazine article that described in detail how to make a bomb, Kelly said.\nAmong his Internet postings, the commissioner said, was an article that states: \"People have to understand that America and its allies are all legitimate targets in warfare.\"\nThe New York Police Department's Intelligence Division was involved in the arrest. Kelly said Pimentel spent most of his years in Manhattan and lived about five years in Schenectady.\nAsked why federal authorities were not involved in the case, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said there was communication with them but his office felt that given the timeline \"it was appropriate to proceed under state charges.\"\nTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS\nThis police photo shown at a news conference on Sunday shows a man identified as Jose Pimentel making a bomb. Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Pimentel, of Manhattan, was arrested Saturday for allegedly plotting to bomb police and post offices in New York City as well as U.S. troops returning home.\n\nLoad-Date: November 21, 2011"
