    "full text": "Dear Editor: In its recent editorial, The Capital Times took the liberty to make fun of House Minority Leader John Boehner for coming to tears in his plea for funding the troops in Iraq until at least this fall. Few congressmen feel so strongly about what they are saying that it leads them to tears and for that Boehner should be admired, not put down.\nWhen the minority leader made it clear that he believes more U.S. lives will be sacrificed in Iraq as a response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, he made no claim that the Iraqis were responsible for the attacks. As the editorial so clearly pointed out, nor did President Bush. In fact, in Bush's declaration of war against terrorism, the events of 9/11 were only a part of the reasons he cited. He indicated that we would be at war with those who supported terrorists as Iraqi President Saddam Hussein did by giving $25,000 to families of suicide bombers.\nIraq proved itself to be led by a terrorist himself when he chose to invade Kuwait to plunder its resources and women. His government terrorized his own people when they killed Shiites en mass and gassed thousands of Kurds.\nI suppose by serendipity the paper suggested that we should be weeping for the republic, which I happen to agree with wholeheartedly, but I am certain for a different reason. The fact that there are people who don't recognize that the war in Iraq is now an essential part of the overall war on terrorism and want to use it for their own political advantage is what should bring us all to tears.\n\nLoad-Date: June 19, 2007"
