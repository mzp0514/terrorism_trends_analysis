Pervez Musharraf on efforts to stabilize neighboring Afghanistan, an official said.\nCheney arrived on this morning and went straight to Musharraf's office in Rawalpindi, just south of the capital Islamabad, for talks on bilateral and international issues, a senior official in the president's office said on condition of anonymity because he is not an official spokesman.\nIt was unclear if Cheney joined the same talks held today between Musharraf and visiting British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett.\nCheney praised Pakistan's contribution in the war against terrorism, but he also communicated his \"apprehensions\" about the possibility that the Taliban is regrouping in Afghanistan to launch a spring offensive against coalition forces there, the official said.\nMusharraf reiterated Pakistan's \"firm\" resolve in the war against terrorism and said that Pakistan, Afghanistan and the coalition forces must ensure close coordination to jointly tackle any such possible attacks, the official said.\nThe New York Times, citing unnamed sources, reported today that President Bush has decided to send a tough message to Musharraf, warning him that the Democrat- controlled Congress may cut off funding to Pakistan unless it gets more aggressive in hunting down al-Qaida and Taliban operatives in its country.\n\nLoad-Date: February 27, 2007"
