The lawyer also noted \"desperation and paranoia\" observed by government agents who were monitoring Osmakac for more than a year before he was arrested.\n\"This report doesn't address some critical issues,\" Fernandez said of Goldsmith's conclusions.\nPorcelli said he will allow Fernandez to question Goldsmith at a hearing, but he did not set the date, allowing lawyers to confer with one another.\nFernandez withdrew a motion he had filed asking for information about an informant. Assistant U.S. Attorney Sara Sweeney asked that the motion be stricken because Fernandez had not spoken to the prosecution before filing.\nFernandez also filed a motion asking for any surveillance recordings of Osmakac obtained under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a law that governs how the government secretly may monitor communications involving U.S. citizens in cases of national security.\nIn that motion, which alludes to a possible entrapment defense, Fernandez says Osmakac was subject to extensive interviews and had materials and documents seized when he flew to Detroit from Istanbul in 2011.\nThat flight had a stop in Amsterdam, and inspectors there notified U.S. Homeland Security inspectors of their concerns, Fernandez wrote.\nFernandez said he would like to withdraw from the case; he has cited \"irreconcilable differences\" with Osmakac in court pleadings. Fernandez said another lawyer might enter the case, allowing him to withdraw.\nesilvestrini@tampatrib.com\n(813) 259-7837\nCopyright Â© 2013, The Tampa Tribune and may not be republished without permission.
