    "full text": "LOS ANGELES - The nuclear terrorism thriller \"The Sum of All Fears\" continued to add up with moviegoers, taking in $ 18.7 million to remain the No. 1 film for a second weekend.\n\"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood\" opened in second place with $ 16.35 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.\n\"Bad Company,\" another film about a stray nuclear device, proved a bit of a bomb. It debuted in fourth place with just $ 10.5 million.\nRounding out the top five were the year's biggest hits. \"Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,\" was No. 3 with $ 13.9 million, lifting its total to $ 255 million after 25 days.\n\"Spider-Man\" came in fifth with $ 10 million for a 38-day total of $ 370.1 million.\nThe industry rebounded after last weekend, when the overall box office slumped for the first time in nearly four months. The top 12 movies this weekend grossed $ 101.7 million, up about 8 percent from the same weekend last year.\nStill, it was a relatively quiet weekend compared to most of May, when \"Spider-Man\" and \"Attack of the Clones\" drove up revenues by 50 percent or more each weekend.\n\"You get used to expecting record-breaking films every weekend, especially this summer. I think we're just in a lull,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box office tracker Exhibitor Relations. \"It's a little slow now, then some big movie will come along and set the world on fire again.\"\nNext weekend brings three major releases: the live-action adaptation of \"Scooby-Doo,\" Matt Damon's spy adventure \"The Bourne Identity\" and Nicolas Cage's war drama \"Windtalkers.\"\n\nLoad-Date: June 11, 2002"
