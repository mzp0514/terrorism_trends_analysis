    "full text": "BE CAUTIOUS, THE STATE DEPARTMENT is warning: Terrorists may be plotting anti-U.S. attacks tied to millennium celebrations here and abroad. Time to panic? No.\nThere is no specific evidence, says the State Department. But U.S. citizens abroad should be alert anyway - and would be wise to avoid large crowds.\nIn recent days, two Algerians were arrested in separate incidents on suspicion of smuggling bomb materials into the United States from Canada. Then the FBI warned of the possibility of mail bombs from terrorists.  But still, these are suspicions, not evidence.\nSafe or at risk? Americans, especially those heading for turn-of-the-millennium celebrations in other lands, might consider these points:\n* No matter how expert a nation's intelligence-gathering, there is no sure-fire way to predict terrorism.\n* Even one human lost to terrorism would be a tragedy - and although the world's more reprehensible terrorist groups seem neither particularly strong nor active right now, tragedy requires only one fanatic with a suitcase bomb.\n* Sadly, America's relative wealth and power, and sometimes its policies, all can generate envy and enmity. At no time are Americans ever totally safe - not even in U.S. cities.\nThere's no reason to cancel trips. But as you travel about these holidays, be alert - and be safe.\n\nLoad-Date: December 26, 1999"
