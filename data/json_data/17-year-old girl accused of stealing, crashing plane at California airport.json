She was able to start one of the engines, officials said.\n \"The aircraft began to move and pivot and crashed into a building and a fence on airport property,\" Bessinger said at a news conference. \"The aircraft never became airborne and there was no fire. The aircraft did sustain some substantial damage, however.\"\n When officers found the girl, they said she was uncooperative and appeared to be disoriented. She was taken into custody and expected to be booked Wednesday into juvenile hall.\n Authorities said Wednesday the incident happened in the airport's general aviation section.\n \"No commercial passengers or commercial aircraft were ever placed at risk,\" Bessinger said.\n Officials continue to investigate how and why the teenager started the plane's engine.\n \"(Her) motives are still under investigation, however, there is no indication of a domestic terrorism-related motive,\" Bessinger said.\n No injuries were reported.\n\nLoad-Date: December 19, 2019"
