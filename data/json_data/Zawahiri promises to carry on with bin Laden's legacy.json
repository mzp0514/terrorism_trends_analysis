    "full text": "LONDON -- Egyptian radical Ayman al Zawahiri on Wednesday issued his first statement since U.S. special forces killed al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. In a video, Zawahiri promised to carry on the terror group founder's war against the West. \nBut Zawahiri, long bin Laden's deputy, did not claim bin Laden's mantle as the head of al-Qaida, an omission that adds to the ongoing debate among terrorism experts over who will lead the terrorist organization. \n\"The man who terrified America in his life will continue to terrify it after his death,\" Zawahiri said in the 28-minute video, which was released by al-Qaida's media branch. \nAt a conference on terrorism here, one former jihadist, Noman Benotman, a Libyan who fought in Afghanistan as part of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, said he believes Zawahiri, who is considered less charismatic and more divisive than bin Laden, won't lead the organization alone. \nSome of the leadership functions, Benotman said, are likely to be assumed by a former Guantanamo detainee, Ibrahim al Rubaish, 33, a cleric from Saudi Arabia who is now the spiritual leader of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, the terrorist group's affiliate in Yemen. \nPlacing Rubaish in a leadership role would let al-Qaida \"keep the narrative\" of its Saudi roots, Benotman said. Moreover, Rubaish's four years at Guantanamo elevate his role as a jihadist. \n\"No one can question his credibility or his willingness to sacrifice himself for the cause,\" Benotman said. \n\nLoad-Date: June 9, 2011"
