    "full text": "Stocks fell yesterday, with traders unnerved by the two fears that idled buyers the entire week -- revived concerns about more attacks on America and the weakness of the nation's economic recovery.\n     In the lightest trading day so far this year, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 111.82 points, or 1.09 percent, to 10,104.26, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 36.14 points, or 2.13 percent, to 1,661.49. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gave up 13.26 points, or 1.21 percent, to 1,083.82. \n For the week, the Dow was down 2.4 percent, Nasdaq dropped 4.6 percent and the S.& P. 500 was off over 2 percent. The drop this week subtracted nearly half of last week's giant rally, which for the Nasdaq was the largest in over a year.\n\"All this rhetoric about the terrorism battle keeps a lid on the market,\" said Michael Kayes, chief investment officer at Eastover Capital Management, which oversees $300 million. Markets will be closed Monday for Memorial Day.\n\"Coming into a long weekend with anxieties about terrorism, the question is: 'Do I want to be invested?' The answer is maybe not -- you come back Tuesday and start over,\" said Barry Hyman, chief investment officer at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum.\nAmong individual stocks, Applied Materials and other semiconductor companies slumped after Goldman, Sachs reduced the chip equipment sector to market weight from market overweight, saying that since February, the stocks have outperformed the Nasdaq by nearly 30 percent. Applied shares fell $1.77, or nearly 7 percent, to $23.80.\nSun Microsystems said companies were still holding back from investing in technology, but it stood by its forecast of a return to profit in its quarter ending in June. Sun, the second-most active issue on Nasdaq, fell 55 cents, to $6.86.\nFurther souring the mood was government data showing that gross domestic product, a crucial measure of economic growth, grew at a revised 5.6 percent annual rate in the first quarter -- below economists' forecasts for a growth rate of 6 percent and below advance figures that showed growth at a 5.8 percent clip. Still, the latest data showed the economy had grown at its fastest pace in nearly two years.\n Declining stocks outpaced advancers by a ratio of about 19 to 12 on the New York Stock Exchange and 21 to 12 on Nasdaq, where 1.2 billion shares traded. The Big Board logged its lightest volume day for 2002, with 892 million shares changing hands.\nIn the plus column, shares of home builders' rose after the government reported a surge in new-home sales in April. Shares of Pulte Homes gained $2.13, to $55.48.\nAnother of the market's few bright spots vanished when Lehman Brothers Holdings withdrew its $5 billion bid for the CIT unit of Tyco International. Tyco shares, the most active on the New York Stock Exchange, fell 67 cents, or 2.75 percent, to $23.70, while Lehman's stock slid $1.15, or 1.7 percent, to $64.57.\nBiogen soared $9.15, or 23 percent, to $49.47, after an advisory panel recommended regulatory approval of its Amevive drug for chronic psoriasis.\nTreasury bonds were mixed in a holiday-shortened session. The 10-year note climbed 2/32, to a price of 98. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, dropped to 5.14 percent from 5.15 percent. The 30-year bond, meanwhile, dropped 1/32, to 95 27/32. Its yield was unchanged at 5.67 percent.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \nGraph tracks the Dow Jones industrial average over the past year.
