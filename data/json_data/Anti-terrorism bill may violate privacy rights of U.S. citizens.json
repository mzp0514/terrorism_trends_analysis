    "full text": "This is really creepy.\nIt is perfectly understandable that the U.S. government would want to keep a closer tab on those suspected of terrorism; we expect them to.\nU. HawaiiIt is also perfectly understandable that in keeping with this objective, the government would like a few changes made to streamline the system.\nBut this is too much. And when governments overreact, civil rights suffer most.\nPresident Bush says the bill upholds the rights intended in the U.S. Constitution; we're not so sure. Anytime the government takes major action to allow its law enforcement to conduct surveillance of its people without people knowing they're being watched, we should be concerned.\nOur phones, our e-mail, our computer activity, our business records, our homes -- these are things that, as Americans, we take for granted will be left alone. What we don't want to see is law enforcement officials who take advantage of the paranoia at hand to violate the rights of suspects without retribution.\nWe don't have a problem with toughening punishments for acts of terrorism; it's a fine idea, as long as those punishments are kept reasonable. We don't have a problem with expanding the definition of an \"act of terrorism,\" as long as those definitions are reset in good faith.\nWhat we do have a problem with is the idea that American citizens could have their privacy taken away from them without ever being given an opportunity to defend themselves against accusations of terrorism.\nWe hope that law enforcement officials -- both federal and local -- will be judicious in the use of these new powers.\n(C) 2001 Ka Leo O Hawaii via U-WIRE\n\nLoad-Date: October 29, 2001"
