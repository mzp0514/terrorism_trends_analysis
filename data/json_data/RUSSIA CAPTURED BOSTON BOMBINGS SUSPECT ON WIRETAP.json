    "full text": "WASHINGTON -- Russian authorities secretly recorded a telephone conversation in 2011 in which one of the Boston bombing suspects vaguely discussed jihad with his mother, officials said Saturday, days after the U.S. government finally received details about the call.\nIn another conversation, the mother of now-dead bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev was recorded talking to someone in southern Russia who is under FBI investigation in an unrelated case, officials said.\nThe conversations are significant because, had they been revealed earlier, they might have been enough evidence for the FBI to initiate a more thorough investigation of the Tsarnaev family.\nAs it was, Russian authorities told the FBI only that they had concerns that Mr. Tsarnaev and his mother were religious extremists. With no additional information, the FBI conducted a limited inquiry and closed the case in June 2011.\nTwo years later, authorities say Mr. Tsarnaev and his brother, Dzhohkar, detonated two homemade bombs near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three and injuring more than 260. Mr. Tsarnaev was killed in a police shootout and Dzhohkar Tsarnaev is under arrest.\nIn the past week, Russian authorities turned over to the United States information it had on Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva. The Tsarnaevs are ethnic Chechens who emigrated from southern Russia to the Boston area over the past 11 years.\nEven had the FBI received the information from the Russian wiretaps earlier, it's not clear that the U.S. government could have prevented the attack.\nIn early 2011, the Russian FSB internal security service intercepted a conversation between Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his mother vaguely discussing jihad, according to U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigation with reporters.\nThe two discussed the possibility of Tamerlan Tsarnaev going to Palestine, but he told his mother he didn't speak the language there, according to the officials, who reviewed the information Russia shared with the U.S.\nIn a second call, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva spoke with a man in the Caucasus region of Russia who was under FBI investigation. Jacqueline Maguire, a spokeswoman for the FBI's Washington Field Office, where that investigation was based, declined to comment.\nThere was no information in the conversation that suggested a plot inside the United States, officials said.\nIt was not immediately clear why Russian authorities didn't share more information at the time. It is not unusual for countries, including the U.S., to be cagey with foreign authorities about what intelligence is being collected.\nNobody was available to discuss the matter early today at FSB offices in Moscow.\nJim Treacy, the FBI's legal attache in Moscow between 2007 and 2009, said the Russians long asked for U.S. assistance regarding Chechen activity in the United States that might be related to terrorism.\n\"On any given day, you can get some very good cooperation,\" Mr. Treacy said. \"The next you might find yourself totally shut out.\"\nZubeidat Tsarnaeva has denied that she or her sons were involved in terrorism. She has said she believed her sons have been framed by U.S. authorities.\nBut Ruslan Tsarni, an uncle of the Tsarnaev brothers and Zubeidat Tsarnaeva's former brother-in-law, said Saturday he believes the mother had a \"big-time influence\" as her older son increasingly embraced his Muslim faith and decided to quit boxing and school.\nAfter receiving the narrow tip from Russia in March 2011, the FBI opened a preliminary investigation into Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his mother. But the scope was extremely limited under the FBI's internal procedures.\nAfter a few months, they found no evidence that Mr. Tsarnaev or his mother were involved in terrorism.\nThe FBI asked Russia for more information. After hearing nothing, it closed the case in June 2011.\nIn the fall of 2011, the FSB contacted the CIA with the same information. Again the FBI asked Russia for more details and never heard back.\nAt that time, however, the CIA asked that Mr. Tsarnaev's and his mother's name be entered into a massive U.S. terrorism database.\nThe CIA declined to comment Saturday.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO: Tamerlan Tsarnaev\n\nLoad-Date: April 29, 2013"
