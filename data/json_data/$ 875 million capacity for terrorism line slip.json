    "full text": "Energy brokers have set up a line slip at Lloyd's of London with $ 875 million to cover offshore and onshore oil installations against terrorist attack under Lloyd's new malicious damage and sabotage policy.\nThe facility coincides with a sharp decrease in marine and aviation hull and liability war risk rates as London underwriters grow more confident with continued claims of allied air and naval superiority in the Persian Gulf.\nThe energy line was set up by the five London master energy line slip brokers: C. T. Bowring & Co. Ltd., Willis Corroon P.L.C., Bain Clarkson Ltd., Sedgwick Group P.L.C. and Jenner Fenton Slade Ltd.\nOn shore capacity of $ 700 million is combined with offshore capacity of $ 175 million.  The slip is placed solely at Lloyd's where it is led by underwriters Stephen Merrett and Richard Youell.\nLloyd's previous malicious damage and sabotage excluded terrorist attacks -- directly or indirectly linked with war -- on land risks and fixed off-shore rigs.  The new policy covers all terrorist acts, including damage caused by Iraqi sympathizers (BI, Feb. 11).\nPrecise premium rates will not be known until the coverage is purchased.  But rates quoted for of-shore North Sea installations are around 0.125% of the insured value, said Philip Hallett, executive director in Bowring's energy department.\nClients are demanding the coverage, Mr. Hallett said.  \"They are used to having it and they will want to go on having it.\"\nThe capacity generated should meet most clients' requirements, Mr. Hallett said.\nRates for coverage vary considerably depending on the risk, said Jonathan Marland, deputy chairman of Lloyd Thompson Ltd.  \"The coverage is being requested from a wide variety of clients ranging from chemical plants to hotels.\"\nMeanwhile, marine and aviation hull and liability war risk rates continued to drop in the London market as underwriters were reassured by reports of the allied military supremacy.\n\"In some cases marine hull rates have come down by as much as two thirds,\" said David Lentaigne, managing director of the marine division of Alexander Howden Reinsurance Brokers Ltd.\n\"It is a reflection of the extra security which now exists with the elimination of the Iraqi navy and most of its air force,\" he added.\nMarine hull war risk rates for vessels visiting Ras Tanura in Saudi Arabia have fallen to 0.625% of insured value from 1.5% in a week, Mr. Lentaigne said.  And rates are down to between 0.25% and 0.3125% from 0.375% for Kharg Island off Iran, and to between 0.25% and 0.3125% from 0.5% for vessels visiting Israel.\nMarine and aviation cargo war risk rates also dropped last week.  The joint Lloyd's/Institute of London Underwriters war risk rating committee met Wednesday for the first time in more than a week and a half to set new marketwide rates.\nThe following cargo war risk rates were changed:\n* Iranian Gulf ports, places and offshore islands north of 27 degrees 30 minutes north latitude.  Marine cargo war risk rates were cut to 0.25% of insured value from 0.75%.\n* Gulf ports and places south of 27 degrees 30 minutes north latitude and west of 52 degrees east longitude.  Marine cargo war risk rates were cut to 0.5% from 1%.\n* Qatar and Bahrain ports and places.  Marine rates were cut to 0.5% from 1%, and aviation rates to 0.125% from 0.25%.\n* Saudi Arabian Red Sea ports including Jeddah.  Marine rates were cut to 0.1% from 0.125%.  Aviation rates for Jeddah were cut to 0.075% from 0.125%.\n* Israeli Mediterranean and Red Sea ports.  Marine rates were cut to 0.2% from 0.25%.\n* Jordan.  Marine rates were cut to 0.2% from 0.25%, and aviation rates were cut to 0.15% from 0.25%.\n* Turkey.  Aviation rates were cut to 0.025% from 0.05%."
