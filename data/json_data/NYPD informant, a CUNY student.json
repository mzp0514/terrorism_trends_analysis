The NYPD has denied the presence of informants on the QC campus and MSA officers have had no suspicions otherwise.\"We have focused on relief efforts, educating others about Islam, building ties with the campus community and providing a place for people to feel comfortable,\" MSA President Saad Jawed said.\n\nLoad-Date: March 10, 2016"
