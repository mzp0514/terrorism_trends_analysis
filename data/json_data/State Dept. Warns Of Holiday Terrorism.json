    "full text": "The State Department announced today that it had received \"credible information\" about plans for terrorist attacks against American citizens from now until the beginning of next year.\nThe department released what it called a \"worldwide terrorism warning,\" advising Americans to stay away from \"large gatherings and celebrations\" throughout the world. The statement was not specific about which groups were planning the attacks or where attacks might take place. But it specified the period \"up to and through the beginning of the New Year and Ramadan events and celebrations from now until January 2000.\"\nA department spokesman, James Foley, said he could not give specifics. He said the department had issued a similar \"worldwide\" warning last month after the administration imposed sanctions on the Taliban, which rules most of Afghanistan.\nFor the last year or more, the State Department has issued many such warnings, often around holidays. This one is notable in part because it urges Americans to avoid large crowds, and yet people all over the world are likely to gather to celebrate the beginning of the year 2000.\nA State Department official said he believed that today's warning had been issued because the department had received information that Osama bin Laden, who the administration says was behind the bombing of two American Embassies in Africa in August 1998, was planning attacks against Americans and that some \"targeting\" information may have been received.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: December 12, 1999"
