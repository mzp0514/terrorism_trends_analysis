    "full text": "SPRINGFIELD - State lawmakers and Attorney General Jim Ryan are making a second run at getting an anti-terrorism law on the books in Illinois.\nThe bill's fate before Gov. George Ryan, however, is unsure because the proposal continues to include the death penalty for terrorists who murder.\nOn Wednesday, a House committee unanimously approved a revised version of the package proposed last year by the attorney general. It would change the requirements for a firearm identification card and would allow officials to eavesdrop on terrorist-related conversations.\nThe governor recommended a majority of the measure, but specifically said he did not favor the death penalty portion.\n\"I am hopeful the governor will sign it, I don't see any good reason not to sign this bill,\" the attorney general said. \"We have addressed every concern he has had, except for making the crime death eligible. If someone carries out an act of domestic terrorism that results in the loss of life should at least be death eligible.\"\nThe Sept. 11-inspired legislation was approved last fall, but George Ryan in February made several changes to the package and returned it to lawmakers. He told the General Assembly it needed to approve his changes, which included removing a death penalty provision, before he would sign it.\nThe governor filed a 12-page explanation about his actions, saying lawmakers were reacting to the events of Sept. 11 and not fully thinking about the measures they passed.\nJim Ryan is the Republican candidate for governor in November. George Ryan will not seek a second term.\nCritics say the bill repeats federal laws and is unnecessary.\nThe attorney general disagrees. \"The fact that there are federal laws does not mean we don't pass state laws,\" he said. \"We should give the police officers the tools to deal with terrorism. Illinois does need this bill.\"\nThe package goes before the full House for a vote. House Speaker Michael Madigan, D-Chicago, predicted the measure would be approved and sent to the governor.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nJim Ryan\n\nLoad-Date: May 23, 2002"
