    "full text": "Gov. Tom Wolf, Mayor Bill Peduto and Pittsburgh Police Chief Cameron McLay are providing sane leadership in maintaining our commitment to Syrian refugees, whose plight is heartbreaking and partly the fault of our own hubristic foreign policy.\nAs Mr. Peduto points out (\"Mayor Peduto Sticks to Pledge to Host Syrian Refugees,\" Nov. 17), refugees have to undergo nearly two years of background checks before gaining entrance to the United States.\nNearly two years of background checks?Too bad we can't consider even one quarter of that for gun purchasers - maybe then we wouldn't have to suffer the domestic terrorism of tens of thousands of shooting deaths every year in schools, malls, theaters, workplaces and homes.\nAccording to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and compiled by CNN, between 2001 and 2013 the death toll from foreign terrorists on American soil is less than 3,500 while the death toll on American soil from guns is more than 400,000.\nSlamming the door in the face of Syrian refugees based on fear of terrorism is inhumane, un-American and cowardly. I'm glad our leaders and law enforcers in Pennsylvania are sensible and thoughtful men who understand that if we are serious about our values of a free civil society we don't start closing the door on families in need because of irrational, fear-based responses to sensational events.\n\nLoad-Date: November 20, 2015"
