    "full text": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) - Police and soldiers emboldened by state of emergency powers swept up hundreds of activists and opposition members on Sunday, dragged away protesters shouting \"Shame on you!\" and turned government buildings into barbed-wire compounds.\nGen. Pervez Musharraf's government said parliamentary elections could be delayed up to a year as it tries to stamp out a growing Islamic militant threat - effectively linking two of the greatest concerns of Pakistan's biggest international donors: the United States and Britain.\nIncreasingly concerned about the unfolding crisis, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Washington was reviewing billions of dollars in aid to its close terrorism-fighting ally. Britain also is examining its assistance.\n\"Some of the aid that goes to Pakistan is directly related to the counterterrorism mission,\" Rice told reporters traveling with her. \"We just have to review the situation.\"\nBut, she said, she did not expect the U.S. \"to ignore or set aside our concerns about terrorism.\"\nScores of paramilitary troops blocked access to the Supreme Court and parliament. Streets in the capital appeared largely calm, with only a handful of demonstrations. But one, attended by 40 people at the Marriott Hotel, was broken up by baton-wielding police.\n\"Shame on you! Go Musharraf go!\" the protesters shouted as officers dragged some out of the crowd and forced them to the ground. Eight were taken away in a van.\nOthers were apathetic. Standing at on a dusty street corner in Islamabad, Togul Khan, 38, said he didn't care about the emergency declaration.\n\"For us, life stays the same, even when politicians throw Pakistan into the sky, spin it around and watch as it crashes back down to earth,\" the day laborer said as he waited for work.\n\nLoad-Date: November 6, 2007"
