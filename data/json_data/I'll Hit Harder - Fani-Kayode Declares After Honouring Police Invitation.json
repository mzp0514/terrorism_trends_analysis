The Police were courteous and professional,' he said in a statement.\n'I was invited because of my essay titled 'Five Useful Idiots and The Spirit Of The Accursed Slave' which was about Fulani hegemony and terrorism together with other write-ups. No regrets. I will hit harder and write more.'\n\nLoad-Date: September 6, 2018"
