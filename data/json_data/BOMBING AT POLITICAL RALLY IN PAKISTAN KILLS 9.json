Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the bombing in a statement, reiterating the United Nations' support for Pakistani efforts \"to combat the scourge of terrorism.\"\nMr. Bilour was leaving the rally after delivering the keynote speech when the attack occurred, said Nazir Khan, a local Awami National Party leader.\n\"There was smoke and dust all around, and dead and wounded people were lying on the ground,\" he said.\nThe suicide bomber was on foot, said another police officer, Imtiaz Khan.\nMian Iftikhar Hussain, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa information minister and a member of the Awami National Party, said both he and Mr. Bilour had repeatedly received threats from militants. He condemned the attack and said the government needed to intensify its battle against the Taliban.\n\"Terrorism has engulfed our whole society,\" said Mr. Hussain. \"They are targeting our bases, our mosques, our bazars, public meetings and our security checkpoints.\"\nTen Taliban militants attacked the military area of an international airport in Peshawar with rockets and car bombs a week ago, killing four people and wounding over 40 others. Five of the militants were killed during the attack, and five others died the next day in a gunbattle with security forces.\nIn southwestern Pakistan, gunmen late Friday killed 11 Pakistanis and Afghans who were trying to cross into neighboring Iran to travel on to Europe as illegal immigrants, said local government official Zubair Ahmed. The shooting took place in Sunsar town in Baluchistan province, he said.\nIt was not immediately clear who was behind the attack, but hundreds of Pakistanis and Afghans are captured by Iranian border guards every year for illegally trying to travel to Europe to find better jobs.\n\nLoad-Date: December 24, 2012"
