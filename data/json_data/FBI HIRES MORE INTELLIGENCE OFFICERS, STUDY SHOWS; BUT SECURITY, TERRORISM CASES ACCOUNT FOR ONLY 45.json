    "full text": "The number of FBI intelligence officers has grown almost fivefold during the Clinton administration, but internal security and terrorism cases accounted for only 45 of the FBI's 12,730 convictions in 1998, a Syracuse University research center reported Sunday.\nThe research center cautioned that convictions may not be the best measure of the effectiveness of the FBI intelligence effort, and an FBI executive said the small number may reflect the bureau's success in preventing actual terrorist attacks.\nFBI Director Louis Freeh has publicly stated that the bureau is putting top priority on thwarting foreign spies and preventing terrorist attacks, but data about the change in emphasis have been sparse because so many of the operations are classified.\nCiting federal employment data, Syracuse's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC, said the total of FBI intelligence officers increased to 1,025 last year from 224 in 1992, but the exact duties of these officers were undetermined.\nAssistant FBI Director John Collingwood said in an interview that the officers were intelligence analysts, and that the increase in the number of such officers mirrored an increase in field agents assigned to hunt spies and battle terrorists. But he added that those employment figures were secret.\nThe new intelligence analysts were hired \"as part of our effort to use our information more effectively across programs, as opposed to limiting its use within one program,\" Collingwood said in an interview.\nLast year, the Justice Department's inspector general criticized the national security division for not sharing key intelligence information about China.\nSo Freeh carved two new divisions out of the national security division: a counterterrorism division and an investigative support division. Collingwood said analysts are assigned to all three divisions, but he said most were in the investigative support division.\n\"It's all part of our effort to play a larger role in the intelligence community in counterintelligence and counterterrorism activity, to identify, prevent and disrupt terrorists,\" Collingwood said.\nThe TRAC study said Justice Department records show that in 1998 there were 37 terrorism convictions and eight internal security convictions from FBI cases. There was no earlier Justice data on terrorism cases because the category was only recently used, but national security convictions totaled seven each in 1992 and 1993, four in 1994, 12 in 1995 and eight each in 1996, 1997 and 1998.\nIn 1998, drug cases, bank robberies and bank fraud were still the three categories producing the most FBI convictions.\n\nLoad-Date: August 28, 2000"
