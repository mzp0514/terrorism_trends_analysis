    "full text": "Colorado Springs Airport will receive at least three $600,000 machines this summer -- possibly June or July -- that screen luggage for explosives and other contraband, and the airport may get additional machines.\nAirport director of marketing, Mary Collins, said the machines are very big, and logistics planning is underway to determine how best to locate them for maximum efficiency.\nTo be purchased by the new U.S. Transportation Security Administration, the machines must be operating by the end of the year to inspect all baggage placed on aircraft. Total luggage inspection is part of the nation's anti-terrorism initiatives following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks that used hijacked commercial airliners as bombs.\nCollins said airport planners are designing internal logistics systems to ensure a smooth transition to accommodate the added inspection measures and to prevent flight delays.\nShe said the shift from airline security staff to new Transportation Security Administration staff for screening passengers is being phased in under a federal contract with airport security provider Huntleigh Corp. Collins said the airport transition was \"seamless,\" and most travelers have not been aware of the switch.\nCollins said the security employees eventually will be \"federalized.\"\n\nLoad-Date: March 27, 2003"
