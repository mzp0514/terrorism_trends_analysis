    "full text": "Indian President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam expressed concern Saturday about a free mapping program from Google Inc., warning it could help terrorists by providing satellite photos of potential targets.\nGoogle Earth, an Internet site launched in June, allows users to see overlapping satellite photos. \nAlthough not all areas are highly detailed, some images are said to be high resolution, and might show sensitive locations in countries.\nAt a meeting of top police officials in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, Kalam said he worried that \"developing countries, which are already in danger of terrorist attacks, have been singularly chosen\" for providing high resolution images of their sites.\nThe governments of South Korea and Thailand and lawmakers in the Netherlands have expressed similar concerns.\nSouth Korean newspapers said Google Earth provides images of the presidential Blue House and military bases in the country, which remains technically at war with communist North Korea. The North's main nuclear center at Yongbyon is among sites in that country displayed on the service.\nThe Google site contains clear aerial photos of India's parliament building, the president's house and surrounding government offices in New Delhi. There are also some clear shots of Indian defense establishments.\nOfficials at Mountain View, Calif.-based Google did not immediately return a phone call and e-mail seeking comment.\nResponding in August to the concerns of two Dutch lawmakers, Google spokeswoman Catherine Betts noted the software uses information already available from public sources and said its benefits \"far outweigh any negatives from potential abuse.\"\n\nLoad-Date: October 17, 2005"
