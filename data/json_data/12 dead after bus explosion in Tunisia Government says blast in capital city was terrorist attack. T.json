    "full text": "A police officer prevents media from aproaching the scene of a bus explosion Tuesday in Tunis, Tunisia. An explosion struck a bus carrying members of Tunisia's presidential guard, killing at least 12 people.\nTunisia's president declared a 30-day state of emergency across the country and imposed an overnight curfew for the capital after an explosion Tuesday struck a bus carrying members of the presidential guard, killing at least 12 people and wounding 20 others.\nThe government described it as a terrorist attack. The blast on a tree-lined avenue in the heart of Tunis is a new blow to a country that is seen as a model for the region but has struggled against Islamic extremist violence. Radical gunmen staged two attacks earlier this year that killed 60 people, devastated the tourism industry and rattled this young democracy.\nNo one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack against the elite security force that protects the president.\nPresident Beji Caid Essebsi, who wasn't on the bus at the time, declared the state of emergency and curfew. He convened an emergency meeting of his security council for this morning.\nSpeaking on national television, he said Tunisia is at \"war against terrorism\" and urged international cooperation against extremists who have killed hundreds around Europe and the Mideast in recent weeks.\n\"I want to reassure the Tunisian people that we will vanquish terrorism,\" he said.\nTunisia's influential Islamist party denounced the explosion, and urged Tunisians to unite behind the security forces as they hunt for the perpetrators.\n\"Tunisia is targeted because it is a democracy and represents a model of moderate Islam,\" it said.\n\nLoad-Date: November 25, 2015"
