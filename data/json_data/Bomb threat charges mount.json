He also has been indicted in Caldwell County on 68 counts each of terrorism and making false bomb reports, and in Catawba County on 65 counts of terrorism, 64 counts of making false bomb reports and three counts of probation violation.\nWhen Startt was arrested in early July in Matoaka, West Virginia, investigators said that at least 400 bomb threats had been made throughout Caldwell, Catawba and Burke counties during the previous seven weeks.\nStartt had been on probation since October 2015, when he was convicted on three counts of making false bomb reports in May 2015.\nAfter his arrest Startt admitted to violating terms of his probation by fleeing supervision, being behind in court-ordered payments and failing to complete court-ordered community service.
