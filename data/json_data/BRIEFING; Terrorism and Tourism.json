    "full text": "Donna F. Tuttle, the Under Secretary of Commerce for Travel, believes foreign leaders must reassure the traveling public of their firm commitment to combat terrorism and insure visitors' safety abroad.\nTo counter the perception that foreign travel is dangerous and foreign governments are not doing enough, Mrs. Tuttle is scheduled to say at a Washington conference today: ''I believe foreign leaders must stand with the United States in its decision to impose economic sanctions against countries like Libya, which harbor and abet terrorists.\nAt the very least, they must issue convincingly strong statements condemning terrorism or, better yet, agree to endorse existing international conventions which call for stringent actions against terrorism.'' With a few exceptions like Greece and Egypt, the Commerce official says, ''most political decision-makers do not consult their own tourism officials or industry.''\n''This lack of communication means,'' she says, ''that many governments may not now fully appreciate the impact terrorism is having on their countries' tourism industry and economies.''\nMrs. Tuttle is keynoting a two-day conference on ''Terrorism, Tourism and Traveler Security'' sponsored by Antone Security, a consulting concern based in Bowie, Md."
