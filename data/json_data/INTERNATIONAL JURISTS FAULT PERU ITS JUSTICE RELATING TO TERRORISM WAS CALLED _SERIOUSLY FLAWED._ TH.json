    "full text": "A panel of international jurists yesterday sharply criticized Peru's use of its military courts to try civilians on charges of treason.\nThe four-member panel said Peruvian justice had become \"seriously flawed\" in its dealings with terrorism and contravened the country's international legal obligations.\nThe panel, which visited Peru in October, was mandated by the U.S. State Department to judge the extent to which defendants in \"faceless\" military and civilian courts were accorded due process rights under 1992 anti-terrorist laws.\n\"No subject of our inquiry has troubled us more than the use of military tribunals to try civilians on treason charges,\" a summary of the report released yesterday said.\nThe report summary, which was sent to journalists in Lima, was financed by the U.S. Agency for International Development and led to some diplomatic tensions between Lima and Washington.\nThe panel was headed by Robert Goldman, director of the International Legal Studies Program at American University. Argentine lawyer Leon Carlos Arslanian, Italian congressman Ferdinando Imposimato and U.S. Navy Cmdr. Jose Raffucci of the international law division at the Pentagon also took part.\nThe laws were decreed shortly after President Alberto Fujimori seized broad powers for a nine-month period in 1992 in a bid to crush two left-wing insurgencies whose war against the state has killed at least 27,000 people since 1980.\nThousands of guerrilla suspects have been detained under the laws and hundreds of them have been judged and sentenced.\n\nLoad-Date: October 21, 2002"
