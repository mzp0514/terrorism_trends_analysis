    "full text": "Dear editor: By continuing to call the American occupation of Iraq a \"war,\" the media, the Congress, and the American people allow the Bush administration to call every shot.\nWe can't call for troop withdrawal because that is called \"cut and run\" and \"weak on terror.\" We can't redirect the war on terrorism at Pakistan because Iraq is supposedly the \"central front of the war on terror.\" We have to fight every militant uprising that occurs because we must continually strive for \"victory.\"\nThe American involvement in Iraq is not a war! The war was won five years ago, when Baghdad fell, when Saddam Hussein was captured and hanged, when no weapons of mass destruction and no 9/11 links to al-Qaida were found. The war that Congress irresponsibly approved is over.\nIn the name of \"war\" we fight battles that have everything to do with Iraqi civil war and nothing to do with global terrorism. Congress never specifically approved fighting the \"war on terror\" in Iraq. For one thing, that's the wrong place.\nI urge Congress and the media to stop calling the American fight in Iraq a \"war.\" Stop accepting the Bush administration's faulty terminology and start making decisions based on the reality of our situation there (it's an occupation) and re-focus our efforts to the real war on terrorism.\nThen, perhaps, Dick Cheney will no longer get away with dismissing objecting Americans as \"fluctuations in the public opinion polls.\"\n\nLoad-Date: April 29, 2008"
