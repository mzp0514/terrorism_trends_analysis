Lee Ingham, the prosecutor, said on Friday that Mr. Ali’s motive for the attack was political and fell under the definition of the Terrorism Act.\nMr. Ali, who appeared via video link for a hearing at the Old Bailey, London’s criminal court, has been charged with “maliciously” causing an explosion “by means of triacetone triperoxide (TATP) or other explosive substances,” according to court documents.\nThe incident was the fifth terrorism attack in Britain this year. The explosion on the city’s heavily used commuter rail network revived memories of bombings in 2005, which left 52 people dead in the deadliest attack on Britain since World War II.\nMr. Ali, who had been in foster care at the home of a retired couple in Surrey, a county in the Southeast England, was arrested a day after the attack in the departures area of the port in Dover.\nRelated Articles\nArrests in London Tube Bombing Stun a Suburban Town\nYoung Man Charged With Attempted Murder in London Subway Attack\n‘Bucket Bomb’ Strikes London’s Vulnerable Underground\nThe Terrorist Attack That Failed to Terrify\n\nLoad-Date: October 21, 2017"
