    "full text": "The twin evils of racial hatred and terrorism have raised their ugly heads at Florida A&M  University, the state's only historically black public college. In the past three weeks, two bombs  have exploded on campus.\nThe blasts were preceded by a caller spewing racial epithets, and he has  vowed that we haven't seen the last of his work.\nFAMU President Frederick Humphries has acted promptly to quell the fears of students and parents  and ask the state for more security. On Thursday, the university ordered a lockdown of all  buildings by 10 p.m. By Monday, students will be required to wear identification cards to gain  access to campus, and auto access will be restricted. This is a reasonable response: taking  necessary precautions but not overreacting.\nStill, many FAMU students remain reluctant to enter unprotected classroom buildings, and a few  have even gone home out of fear. This only plays into the bigoted bomber's hands.\nWhile it is understandable that students would be a little apprehensive, we hope they will keep  their eyes on the prize, which is education. Even back in 1887, when Florida A&M began as the State  Normal College for Colored Students, there were those who didn't think blacks needed a higher  education. In 1999, it's more important than ever that the opportunity not be slighted or forgone  out of fear.\n\nNotes\n\nEDITORIALS\n\nLoad-Date: September 26, 1999"
