It came hours after visiting U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John D. Negroponte met in Islamabad with President Gen. Pervez Musharraf, a key ally in Washington's war on terrorism.\nThe army reported, meanwhile, that it had killed as many as 50 militants in a battle in the South Waziristan tribal region near the Afghan border.\nThe victims of the suicide attack belonged to the Karar commando group, which has participated in operations against Islamic militants in various parts of the country, according to two security officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of their jobs.\nThey said the bomber struck while dozens of soldiers were eating.\nMaj. Gen. Waheed Arshad, the army spokesman, said 15 soldiers were killed and 11 wounded, some seriously, but he would not confirm what caused the blast at Ghazi Tarbela, in Pakistan's volatile northwest.\n\"It will be only clear when the initial investigations would be completed,\" he told Pakistan's Geo TV network.\n\nLoad-Date: September 14, 2007"
