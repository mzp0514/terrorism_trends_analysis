Eight others were also hurt. Both deputies were expected to survive.\nThe official who spoke Saturday said one of the three students who attended the dinner party hosted by the attacker recorded video from outside the classroom building while the shooting was taking place. The official spoke on condition of anonymity after being briefed by federal authorities. Two other Saudi students watched from a car, the official said.\nThe official said 10 Saudi students were being held on the base Saturday while several others were unaccounted for.\nA U.S. official who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity on Friday identified the shooter as Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani. The official wasn't authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The official also said the FBI was examining social media posts and investigating whether he acted alone or was connected to any broader group.\nTwo U.S. officials identified the student as a second lieutenant in the Saudi Air Force, and said Friday that authorities were investigating whether the attack was terrorism-related. They spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose information that had not yet been made public.\nPresident Donald Trump declined to say whether the shooting was terrorism-related. Trump tweeted his condolences to the families of the victims on Friday and noted that Saudi King Salman had reassured him in a telephone call that the shooter \"in no way shape or form represents the feelings of the Saudi people.\"\nBut in comments echoing those made earlier by Defense Secretary Mark Esper, Trump said Saturday that he would review policies governing foreign military training in the U.S.\nThe U.S. has long had a robust training program for Saudis, providing assistance in the U.S. and in the kingdom. A couple hundred students from countries outside the U.S. are enrolled in training at the Pensacola base, said Base commander Capt. Tim Kinsella.\n\"This has been done for many decades,\" Trump said. \"I guess we're going to have to look into the whole procedure. We'll start that immediately.\"\nThe shooting has shined a spotlight on the sometimes rocky relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia.\nThe kingdom is still trying to recover from the killing last year of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Saudi intelligence officials and a forensic doctor killed and dismembered Khashoggi on Oct. 2, 2018, just as his fiancÃ©e waited outside the diplomatic mission.\nNaval Air Station Pensacola is one of the Navy's most historic and storied bases. It sprawls along the waterfront southwest of the city's downtown and dominates the economy of the surrounding area.\nPart of the base resembles a college campus, with buildings where, in addition to foreign students, 60,000 members of the U.S. Navy, Marines, Air Force and Coast Guard train each year in multiple fields of aviation.\nKinsella said the base would remain closed until further notice.\nResidents of Pensacola mourned the attacks and offered their condolences to the affected members of the community.\nJoshua Watson was being praised as a hero by his family.\nAdam Watson said his little brother was able to make it outside the classroom building to tell authorities where the shooter was after being shot \"multiple\" times. \"Those details were invaluable,\" he wrote on his Facebook page.\nWatson's father, Benjamin Watson, was quoted by the Pensacola News Journal as saying that his son was a recent graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy who dreamed of becoming a Navy pilot. He said he had reported to Pensacola two weeks ago to begin flight training. \"He died serving his country,\" Benjamin Watson said.\nThe shooting is the second at a U.S. naval base in one week. A sailor whose submarine was docked at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, opened fire on three civilian employees Wednesday, killing two before taking his own life.\n\nLoad-Date: December 9, 2019"
