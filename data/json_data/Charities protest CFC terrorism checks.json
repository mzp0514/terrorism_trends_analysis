    "full text": "One of the largest national nonprofit associations in the United States on Oct. 12 condemned the Combined Federal Campaign's requirement for participating charities to check their employees against terrorist watch lists.\nThe National Council of Nonprofit Associations (NCNA) is calling on charities it represents that receive money from CFC to reconsider their involvement in the federal government's annual fund-raising drive, said strategic policy planning director Erica Greeley.\nThe council estimates the number of charities it represents that are also in the CFC to be in the hundreds. Greeley said the council is working on a more thorough list of its CFC charities.\nGreeley said the council is not specifically calling for charities to withdraw from CFC because it recognizes that many depend on CFC money.\nScott Hatch, spokesman for the Office of Personnel Management, which oversees the CFC, said the rules are necessary for a post-9/11 world.\n\"The requirement is there because times have changed,\" Hatch said. \"We have to make sure none of this money is funneled to terrorists who want to kill us.\"\nHatch said OPM does not plan to change its rule. Hatch pointed out that thousands of charities remain on CFC's list and said OPM has received messages of support from other charities who agree with the watch-list requirement.\nOPM is willing to talk to any organization about concerns over the requirement, Hatch said. NCNA did not talk to OPM before issuing its statement, Hatch and Greeley said.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union on July 31 was the first to withdraw from CFC. It argued that checking employees against watch lists would go against its mission and principles. Its withdrawal was followed by Amnesty International, the Center for Constitutional Rights, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Global Fund for Women, the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights and the Alliance for Justice.\nNCNA represents about 23,000 charities nationwide, Greeley said.\n\nLoad-Date: October 27, 2004"
