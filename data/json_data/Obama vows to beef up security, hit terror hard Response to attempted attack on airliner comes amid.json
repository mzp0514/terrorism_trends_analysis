    "full text": "HONOLULU - President Barack Obama vowed Monday to use \"every element of our national power\" to keep Americans safe and said the failed Christmas Day plot to blow up a Detroit-bound airliner was \"a serious reminder\" of the need to continually adapt security measures against changing terrorist threats.\nBut even as Obama spoke, word came that a State Department warning had failed to trigger an effort to revoke the alleged attacker's visa. And officials in Yemen confirmed that the would-be bomber had been living in that country, where terrorist elements quickly sought to take credit for his actions.\nThe incident prompted stiffer airport boarding measures, and authorities warned holiday travelers to expect extra delays as they return home this week and beyond.\nAbdulmutallab, charged with trying to destroy an aircraft, is being held at the federal prison in Milan, Mich. A court hearing that had been scheduled for Monday to determine whether the government can get DNA from him was postponed until Jan. 8. No reason was given.\nCalling Abdulmutallab's action an \"attempted act of terrorism,\" Obama vowed to \"do everything that we can to keep America safe\" and declared: \"The United States will more than simply strengthen our defenses. We will continue to use every element of our national power to disrupt, to dismantle and defeat the violent extremists who threaten us.\"\nMembers of Congress, meanwhile, questioned how a man flagged as a potential terrorist managed to board a commercial flight into the United States carrying powerful explosives and nearly bring down the jetliner. Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., said Monday that the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that he chairs would hold hearings in January.\nMeanwhile, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility for the thwarted attack as retaliation for a U.S. operation against the group in Yemen. Yemeni forces, helped by U.S. intelligence, carried out two airstrikes against al-Qaida operatives this month in the lawless country, which is fast becoming a key front in the war on terrorism. The second airstrike was a day before Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, 23, attempted to bring down a Northwest Airlines flight as it prepared to land in Detroit.\nA statement posted on the Internet by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula said Abdulmutallab had coordinated with members of the group and used explosives manufactured by al-Qaida members.\nSolving one mystery of Abdulmutallab's pre-Detroit path, the Yemeni Foreign Ministry said Monday that he was in Yemen from August until early December to study Arabic at a school in San'a. Citing immigration authorities, the statement said Abdulmutallab had previously studied at the school, indicating it was not his first trip to Yemen.\nObama, on vacation in Hawaii, acknowledged that the attack showed the need to increase U.S. defenses. He detailed the two reviews he has ordered to determine whether changes are needed in either the watch list system or airport screening procedures.\nBack in Washington, federal officials met to review their layered system of watch lists and other procedures to examine how to avoid the types of lapses that led to the attempted attack.\nU.S. officials say Abdulmutallab came to the attention of American intelligence last month, when his father, prominent Nigerian banker Alhaji Umar Mutallab, reported his concerns to the U.S. Embassy in Abuja. A senior U.S. official said the father was worried that his son was in Yemen and \"had fallen under the influence of religious extremists.\" The father did not mention any specific threat.\nThese concerns landed Abdulmutallab among the about 550,000 names in the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment database. Other, smaller lists trigger additional airport screening or other restrictions, but intelligence officials said there wasn't enough information to move him into those categories.\nAnother apparent lapse concerns Abdulmutallab's visa. Britain had refused to grant him a student visa in May, but there was no apparent effort to revoke his U.S. tourist visa, issued in June 2008 and good for multiple entries over two years.\nThe embassy visit by Abdulmatallab's father triggered a Nov. 20 State Department cable from Lagos to all U.S. diplomatic missions and department headquarters in Washington. It was also shared with the interagency National Counter Terrorism Center, said State Department spokesman Ian Kelly.\nThe NCTC, which has responsibility if any visas are to be pulled over terrorism concerns, reviewed the information and found it was \"insufficient to determine whether his visa should be revoked,\" Kelly said.\nHomeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano conceded Monday that the aviation security system failed, backtracking from a statement in which she said it worked.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n Abdulmutallab  NICK UT  â€¢  The Associated Press Los Angeles International Airport police Officer Jerome Evans uses \"K-9 Alda\" to check baggage Monday under increased security efforts. \n\nLoad-Date: December 29, 2009"
