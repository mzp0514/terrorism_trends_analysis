    "full text": "LONDON (AP) - In an embarrassing reversal, Britain admitted Thursday that one of its remote outposts - the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia - had twice been used by the United States as a refueling stop for the secret transfer of two terrorism suspects.\nThe CIA admitted that previous data given to America's strongest ally \"turned out to be wrong.\" British Foreign Secretary David Miliband told Parliament that talks with U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice showed two suspects were on flights to Guantanamo Bay and Morocco in 2002 that stopped on Diego Garcia, a U.S. base on British soil.\nFormer Prime Minister Tony Blair came under heavy criticism for Britain's close alliance with Washington in the war in Iraq and its part in the U.S.-led war on terrorism. The latest disclosure could pressure the U.S. to identify other countries used in extraordinary renditions, a practice of transferring suspects without formal extradition proceedings that human rights groups say opens the door for other countries to torture and interrogate suspects.\nMiliband told lawmakers he was \"very sorry\" to have to correct statements made by the government in 2005, 2006 and 2007 that there were no such transfers involving Britain.\nHe and Rice \"both agree that the mistakes made in these two cases are not acceptable, and she shares my deep regret that this information has only just come to light,\" said Miliband, who has sometimes broken ranks with the British government over military action in Iraq and policies in the Middle East.\n\nLoad-Date: February 22, 2008"
