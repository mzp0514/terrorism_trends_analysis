The PKK is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey and the United States. \n\"Two of our comrades were heroically martyred,\" TAK said in a statement. Hundreds of Turkish security personnel and thousands of fighters aligned with TAK and PKK have been killed since the PKK restarted its decades-long campaign against the Turkish government almost 18 months ago following the collapse of a fragile truce. \nTurkey was observing a national day of mourning Sunday, hours after the blasts near the newly built Besiktas soccer stadium rocked the city. Turkish officials put the death toll at 38; more than 150 people were wounded. Thirty of the victims were police officers. \nThirteen people have been detained in the bombing investigation. \nThree people were also detained for social media posts related to the tragedy, and authorities said they were investigating any posts that praise terrorism. \nThe Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor's office issued a statement, reported by the Associated Press and other media outlets, warning that investigators were looking for any \"news, comment or shares on press and social media platforms that attempted to praise terrorism or terrorist organizations, serve terrorist organizations' propaganda, legitimize terrorism or target those who combat terrorism.\" \n\nLoad-Date: January 11, 2017"
