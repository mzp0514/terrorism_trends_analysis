Ten years in the coming, and finally we got him. What more could you ask for?\"\nSawyer said retribution is possible, however.\n\"There's definitely a concern if this is gonna wake the somewhat slumbering dragon,\" he noted.\nRetired FBI agent Robert Glendon was elated, too. At the same time, he was uncertain about retribution, partly because he said the United States made the war on terrorism a bigger operation than it really was.\nGlendon was not surprised at the al Qaeda leader's death, which he said was really just a question of time. Realistically, he thought President Obama should take credit for bin Laden's demise.\n\"Just like the manager of a good baseball team gets the credit, President Obama should get the credit,\" Glendon said. \"Now we have a different light that's going to be accorded to this (2012) election that's coming up.\"\nMorris Mayor Dick Kopczick believed bin Laden would eventually be captured, but not necessarily killed. Now, he's concerned that reaction could incite \"something even worse than we ever dreamed of.\"\n\"He was cold-hearted,\" the mayor said, noting that bin Laden was a criminal responsible for the deaths of thousands of civilians.\nJerry Terando of Morris, whose son, S/SGT. Joshua Terando, was killed by a sniper in Iraq in 2005, said bin Laden's death is long overdue for a man responsible for the deaths of thousands of others.\nHe said the leader's demise probably will not mark the end of the war on terrorism.\n\"On anything that involves blood, then you get the blood vendetta going,\" Terando pointed out.\nTo see more of The Morris Daily Herald, go to http://www.morrisdailyherald.com.
