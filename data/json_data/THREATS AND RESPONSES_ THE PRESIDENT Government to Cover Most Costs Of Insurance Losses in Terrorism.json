    "full text": "President Bush signed legislation today requiring that the federal government pick up most of the insurance losses in a catastrophic terrorist attack, a move that represented a political triumph for the White House and some relief for the ailing real estate and construction industry in New York.\n     At a formal ceremony in the East Room attended by Mr. Bush's senior political aides and the labor leaders the White House is courting, Mr. Bush said the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, as it is formally known, would restart construction projects that had been put on hold because of the difficulty in getting terrorism insurance since the Sept. 11 attacks. \n \"With this new law, builders and investors can begin construction in real estate projects that have been stalled for too long, and get our hard hats back to work,\" said Mr. Bush, who was flanked on the East Room stage by a group of construction workers in T-shirts and blue jeans. Mr. Bush asserted that a lack of terrorism insurance had held up or caused the cancellation of more than $15 billion in real estate transactions.\nAnd should terrorists strike America again, Mr. Bush said, \"we have a system in place to address financial losses and get our economy back on its feet as quickly as possible.\"\nMr. Bush campaigned hard for the legislation as a boost to American workers during his political travels for the midterm elections, and calling it a legislative priority in the post-election session of Congress. \nThe bill, which does not cover any of the Sept. 11 losses, requires all commercial insurers of buildings to begin offering terrorism coverage immediately. Such coverage had been routinely provided until the Sept. 11 attacks caused losses of more than $40 billion and prompted the industry to withdraw the coverage and ask the White House for help. Some insurers did eventually reintroduce terrorism insurance, but at high cost and in limited amounts.\nThe bill requires the federal government to pay 90 percent of the cost of an attack by foreign terrorists after losses are greater than $10 billion, up to a total of $100 billion. The government will pay a smaller amount for losses less than $10 billion.\nBut the legislation does not set the price of terrorism insurance, which industry experts said was likely to remain high.\n\"The risk is still astronomical,\" said Gary Karr, the spokesman for the American Insurance Association. \"It's going to be a very difficult challenge for companies to figure out the underwriting rules for this. Terrorism is still an extremely difficult risk to predict.\"\nThe legislation was welcomed today by the New York real estate industry, which had lobbied extensively for it in Washington. The industry has seen the credit rating lowered on some of the city's major buildings -- among them the Rockefeller Center complex and the Conde Nast and Marriott Marquis towers in Times Square -- because of inadequate terrorism coverage. Other buildings could not get terrorism insurance at all.\n\"It certainly is hopeful news,\" said Warren Wechsler, a spokesman for the Real Estate Board of New York, a trade group. \"We think this will accelerate the availability and affordability of terrorism insurance.\"\nMr. Bush signed the bill a week after it passed the Senate by 86 to 11, and 12 days after it cleared the House. Much of the opposition came from House and Senate members in Mr. Bush's own party, who objected to a provision allowing victims of terrorist attacks to sue corporations for punitive damages.\nRepublicans, who wanted to limit the lawsuits against corporations, were eventually won over by Mr. Bush, who made daily calls in support of the bill and promised that he would strive to put in such limitations next year.\nMr. Bush asserted today that the legislation was crucial to economic recovery, but real estate developers have said that the lack of terrorism insurance is just one factor, and that the bill is not a cure-all. In addition, the bill covers only future acts by foreign groups or nations, and does not cover attacks by Americans, like the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.\nBut industry experts said today that the bill was likely to have some calming effect on the insurance markets. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, who was among the president's economic advisers on hand today in the East Room, said in a statement that the legislation \"reduces the economic risks and economic consequences associated with the threat of future terrorist attacks.\"\nThe bill signing, which was attended by Karl Rove and Ken Mehlman, Mr. Bush's top political advisers, was also a sign of how aggressively the White House is pursuing organized labor as a political ally in the re-election campaign. \nArrayed under the chandeliers were a group of union leaders, chief among them Douglas J. McCarron, the general president of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, who is Mr. Bush's closest friend in organized labor. \"Appreciate your leadership, Doug,\" Mr. Bush said.\nMr. Bush also singled out by name Frank Hanley, the general president of the International Union of Operating Engineers; Joe Hunt, general president of the Iron Workers International Union; Ed Sullivan, president of the Building and Construction Trades Department of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.; and Terry O'Sullivan, the general president of the Laborers International Union of North America.\nMr. Bush thanked them all for putting \"the interest of their membership right on the line\" and said that as a result, \"the nation's hard-hats will get back to work, being able to put food on the table for their families.\"\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPhoto: President Bush signing the terrorism insurance act yesterday in the East Room.
