    "full text": "In a landmark decision, the Israeli Supreme Court on Monday outlawed the systematic use of sleep depravation, violent shakings and other physical abuse of Palestinians under interrogation.\nThe decision strikes at widely used tactics born of decades of Middle East conflict, and one of the most criticized aspects of Israel's democracy. While many countries use even harsher methods and deny it, Israel has been unique in setting up legal procedures and attempting to justify what most human rights groups call torture.\nThe official Israeli term is ''moderate physical pressure,'' and most Israelis consider it necessary to prevent terrorism. Immediately after the ruling Monday, politicians said the decision weakens the country's ability to thwart terror attacks and called for new laws to circumvent the decision.\nConstitution\nThey noted that just a day before, car bombs were detonated in two Israeli cities, although no Israelis were killed.\nPrime Minister Ehud Barak said in a statement after the ruling that he \" respects\" the court's decision but that it will cause difficulties for the country's security services.\n''It may cause real damage to our ability to fight terror,'' Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh told Israel Radio. ''It's very nice to have liberal legislation, maybe it is good in Scandinavia or Western Europe or North America, but in our part of the world, where we have fought terrorism so bitterly, such a verdict is almost completely irrelevant to the world we live in.''\nBut the court, in the opinion, addressed the ''difficult reality in which Israel finds herself security-wise.''\n''Although a democracy must often fight with one hand tied behind its back, it nonetheless has the upper hand,'' the ruling stated. A democracy's rule of law and protection of liberty ''strengthen its spirit and strength and allow it to overcome its difficulties.''\nThe ruling leaves security officials immune from legal prosecution if they can show that mistreatment was committed out of life-saving necessity.\nDespite such a large loophole, human rights activists considered the ruling a major victory.\nThey have long disputed the security establishment's assertion that the physical abuse is used to find ''ticking bombs.''\nInstead, they say the mistreatment is usually used to fish for information and extract confessions. They note that interrogations frequently stop during weekends when interrogators take a day off, a sign they are not seeking to stop attacks.\nSince 1987, 10 Palestinians have died under interrogation and thousands have been subjected to torture, according to the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem.\n''What it has become is a whole bureaucracy of torture, a whole army of bureaucrats and doctors and lawyers,'' said B'Tselem Executive Director Eitan Felner. ''Finally, the High Court of Justice said, even in the name of security, there are some things that cannot be justified.''\nFelner said other countries facing terrorism, including the United States and Britain, outlaw torture. But, he said the practice has grown in Israel out of the ''siege mentality that Israel developed over the last 30 years.''\nAt least since the early 1970s, Israel has used physical mistreatment against Palestinians. The techniques are infrequently used against Jewish Israelis.\nIsraeli law forbids the physical abuse of inmates. But, since 1987, regulations from the prime minister have established procedures, including court oversight, under which the abuse can take place.\nPart of Monday's ruling, issued in response to an appeal from six Palestinians and four human rights groups, stated that regulations cannot be used if they go against the country's law.\nOften, according to a government commission, security services have lied to judges about the methods being used. Other times, they get approval from the courts by arguing that there is an emergency security need for extreme treatment.\nThe most dangerous treatment is violent shaking while an inmate's hands and feet are cuffed. It leaves them dazed, nauseous and sometimes with spinal injuries.\nAlso, many inmates are made to squat on the ground while their hands are cuffed, behind their back at head level. Some are handcuffed hanging from pipes so they must spend hours on their toes.\nInmates frequently are hooded for hours or days, forced to stay awake for days, and subjected to loud music or screaming.\nPalestinian Abed Ahmar, of Bethlehem, said he was subjected to interrogation for two months in 1996, after being arrested for reasons never explained to him. He was never charged, but was taken to the barbed-wire- enclosed Russian Compound jail in Jerusalem.\nHe said he would be shaken for three to five seconds at a time. Sometimes he passed out and awoke in the infirmary. Sometimes, security agents would bring a mirror to show him his bloodshot eyes and ashen face.\n''You don't look like yourself,'' he said. ''Sometimes a person feels like it's three hours they've been shaken.''\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPhoto\nAn interrogation technique allegedly used on Palestinian prisoners is demonstrated by the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem.
