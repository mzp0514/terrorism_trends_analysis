The government must find out what went wrong and what can be done to better protect us. But while it's important to react quickly, it's also important to react wisely.\n  The government should adopt effective, narrowly tailored security measures that reflect the level of threat to flight safety and pose minimal risk to privacy. If more than one screening method is effective, the least intrusive technology or technique should be used.\n  Our watch lists, which at 1.1 million identities affect far too many innocent people but have failed to identify true terrorist threats, must be revamped. Body scanners, which produce strikingly graphic images of people's bodies, should be used only when factual evidence demands it and not routinely.\n  The government must work fervently to provide the best security possible. But Americans can't be complacent about giving up civil liberties, especially to ineffective policies that don't make us safer. In America, striving to be both safe and free is not a zero-sum game; we should enact policies with both goals in mind.\n  Michael German  Washington, Dec. 30, 2009\n  The writer is policy counsel for the Washington legislative office of the American Civil Liberties Union and a former F.B.I. agent.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: January 3, 2010"
