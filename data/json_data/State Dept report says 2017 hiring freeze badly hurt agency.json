    "full text": "WASHINGTON - A 2017 Trump administration hiring freeze at the State Department had devastating effects, hurting core functions such as providing services to U.S. citizens abroad and protecting embassies, the agency's internal watchdog said Friday.\nThe department's inspector general said all domestic offices and nearly all overseas missions surveyed reported that the freeze had a \"negative or very negative effect on morale.\"\nIt said 96% of embassies and consulates overseas and 95% of offices in the U.S. reported negative effects on security, consular and administrative operations. Those included oversight of millions of dollars in counter-terrorism, health and human rights programs from Afghanistan to Venezuela.\n\"Several bureaus charged with protecting security, health, and life safety reported to (the inspector general) that the hiring freeze had significant detrimental effects,\" said the report, which was based on surveys of domestic and overseas offices.\nThe report quantifies the effects of a significant across-the-board cutback that caused turmoil in the agency as diplomats struggled to explain the new foreign policy strategy in the chaotic early days of the Trump administration.\nPresident Donald Trump froze hiring immediately after taking office in January 2017 as a cost-cutting measure.\n\nLoad-Date: August 10, 2019"
