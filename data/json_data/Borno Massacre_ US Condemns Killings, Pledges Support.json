While pledging its support for Nigeria against terrorism, it also offered its condolences to the families and friends of those killed or kidnapped.\n In a statement on Monday by US Embassy in Nigeria, the United States offers its deepest \"condolences to the families and friends of those killed or kidnapped. \"These abhorrent attacks are a stark reminder of why the United States stands with the Nigerian government and people as they fight to defeat terrorism and work to bring the perpetrators to justice.\n\"  Meanwhile, the Police Service Commission has described the unprovoked and mindless killing of the farmers in Borno State as horrifying and barbaric, \"especially at a time all efforts are geared towards restoring peace and order in the troubled North-East zone of the country.\" The Commission in a statement on Monday by its spokesman, Ikechukwu Ani, said it was disturbed that the victims of the callous act were ordinary and harmless Nigerians who were on their farms to seek their livelihood.\n According to the commission, there can never be any justifiable reason for madness and cruelty. It called on the security agencies to quickly re-strategize and put an end to \"this unending circle of killings in the North East,\" adding that the citizens should also be in the forefront \"as security has become the business of everybody.\n \"We wish to commiserate with Mr President, the leaders of the North-East, the Government and people of Borno State and the families of the assassinated farmers on this sad development. We pray that God will see the nation through these difficult times.\n\" \n\nLoad-Date: December 3, 2020"
