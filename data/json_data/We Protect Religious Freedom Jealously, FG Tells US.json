The Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed in a statement titled 'Nigeria Denies Religious Freedom Violation Allegation' said Nigeria jealously protects religious freedom as enshrined in the country's constitution and takes seriously any infringements in this regard.\n He described the US inclusion of Nigeria on the list as a case of \"honest disagreement between the two nations on the causes of violence in Nigeria.\" \"Nigeria does not engage in religious freedom violation, neither does it have a policy of religious persecution.\n Victims of insecurity and terrorism in the country are adherents of Christianity, Islam and other religions\", he said.  The United States on Monday for the first time added Nigeria to a blacklist on religious freedom, paving the way for potential sanctions if it does not improve its record.\n Secretary of State Mike Pompeo designated Nigeria as a \"Country of Particular Concern\" for religious freedom, alongside nations that include China, Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia. \n\nLoad-Date: December 8, 2020"
