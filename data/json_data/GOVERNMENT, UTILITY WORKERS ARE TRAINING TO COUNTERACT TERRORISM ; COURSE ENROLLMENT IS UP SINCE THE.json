    "full text": "More than 40 representatives of local governments and utilities are taking part this week in a training program for responding to terrorist attacks.\nThe three-day course, which began Tuesday, is designed primarily for officials of water, health and public works departments.\nPolice and fire officials participated in a similar course tailored to their specialties in April 2000.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice organized the training two years ago. The training under way at St. Louis Community College at Forest Park was scheduled six months ago.\nKen Walk, spokesman for the St. Louis Emergency Management Agency, said enrollment doubled after the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington on Sept. 11. \"That day brought more focus and interest in the course,\" he said.\nTaking part in the training are employees of St. Louis, the counties of St. Louis, St. Charles, Warren and Lincoln and most of the area's utilities. Instructors said the goal was to help local officials quickly determine whether terrorism is a likely cause of a disaster, which federal and state agencies to alert and how to create command systems among many responders.\nEllen Sullivan, a public health nurse for Lincoln County who participated Monday, said, \"We want to learn not only how to manage our response but to best protect our citizens from the consequences of terrorism.\"\n\nLoad-Date: November 28, 2001"
