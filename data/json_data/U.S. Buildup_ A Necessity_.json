A war that started as a swift counterattack against those responsible for the murder of 3,000 Americans, a growing number of critics say, is in danger of becoming a quagmire with a muddled mission. \n  In interviews, most counterterrorism experts said they believed that the troops were needed to drive Taliban fighters from territory they had steadily reclaimed. But critics on the right and the left say that if the real goal is to prevent terrorist attacks on the United States, there may be alternatives to a large ground force in Afghanistan. They say Al Qaeda can be held at bay using intensive intelligence, Predator drones, cruise missiles, raids by Special Operations commandos and even payments to warlords to deny haven to Al Qaeda. \n  After all, they point out, the Central Intelligence Agency has killed more than a dozen top Qaeda leaders in the lawless Pakistani tribal areas, disrupting the terrorists' ability to plot and carry out attacks against the United States and Europe. \n  Andrew J. Bacevich, professor of international relations at Boston University, said the alternatives would have at least as much chance of preventing attacks on the United States as a large-scale counterinsurgency effort, which he said would last 5 to 10 years, require hundreds of billions of dollars, sacrifice hundreds of American lives and have a ''slim likelihood of success.'' \n  Despite the Obama administration's assertions that it has a new approach, ''the truth is they want to try harder to do what we've been doing for the last eight years,'' Mr. Bacevich said.\n  But most specialists on counterterrorism and counterinsurgency, inside and outside the government, say terrorism cannot be confronted from a comfortable distance, such as by airstrikes or proxy forces alone. It may take years to turn Afghanistan into a place that is hostile to Al Qaeda, they say, but it may be the only way to keep the United States safe in the long term. Many agree with the classified strategy for a troop buildup that Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the top commander in Afghanistan, has presented to Mr. Obama and the Joint Chiefs of Staff in recent days. \n  They say a large American-led NATO ground force is needed to clear Taliban-held territory and hold it while instructors train sufficient, competent Afghan soldiers and police officers to secure those areas. The allied force, the argument goes, will buy time and space to help the Afghans build more effective local, provincial and national governments, and create some semblance of an economy. Since many polls in Afghanistan show little support for the Taliban, a stable, peaceful country would not be likely to become a home for terrorists. \n  The administration's ''clear, hold, build'' strategy is meant to win over Afghans. It is based on the counterinsurgency principle of protecting the population -- or, in this case, at least Afghan population centers -- to win confidence and support, before isolating remaining insurgents to be killed or captured. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have maintained that the United States cannot fight terrorists from afar.\n  ''The notion that you can conduct a purely counterterrorist kind of campaign and do it from a distance simply does not accord with reality,'' Mr. Gates told reporters last Thursday. ''The reality is that even if you want to focus on counterterrorism, you cannot do that successfully without local law enforcement, without internal security, without intelligence.'' \n  Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University, concurred, saying the argument that terrorism can be prevented essentially by remote control was ''immensely seductive'' -- and completely wrong.\n  ''We tried to contain the terrorism problem in Afghanistan from a distance before 9/11,'' he said. ''Look how well that worked.''\n  Airstrikes risk killing civilians -- as shown by international concern over the possibility that many civilians were among the scores killed in the NATO bombing of two fuel tankers in northern Afghanistan last week -- and making enemies of the very people American commanders are trying to sway. General McChrystal recently tightened rules on airstrikes to try to avert civilian deaths. \n  Mr. Hoffman said the success of strikes from Predators in killing Qaeda suspects in Pakistan depended on accurate information on terrorists' whereabouts from Pakistani intelligence. In Afghanistan, without such sources, ''we'd be flying blind,'' he said.\n  Disengagement from Afghanistan could destabilize Pakistan and ''guarantee'' a future attack on the United States from the region, Mr. Hoffman said. For starters, a pullout could deny the United States bases from which it carries out some Predator missions.\n  By all accounts, Pakistan remains the wild card that complicates all predictions on Afghanistan. Proponents of the increased American force in Afghanistan say a withdrawal would reinforce Pakistan's fears that the United States is not committed to security in the region, encouraging an old Pakistani strategy of maintaining ties to Islamic militants. \n  But Daniel L. Byman, director of Georgetown's Center for Peace and Security Studies, said calculations on Pakistan's role were complicated. ''The more we escalate in Afghanistan, the more we depend on Pakistan for logistics,'' he said, ''and the more Pakistan may feel it can resist our pressure to go after the militants.''\n  As opposition to the war in Afghanistan builds, some of Mr. Obama's strongest supporters say he must do a better job of explaining how deploying a large American ground force there safeguards Americans at home. \n  ''He needs to reinforce that message more frequently and to the point,'' said Senator Bob Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee who just returned from Afghanistan and Pakistan. ''He hasn't made it enough.'' \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO: In July, American soldiers took fire while on patrol in eastern Afghanistan.
