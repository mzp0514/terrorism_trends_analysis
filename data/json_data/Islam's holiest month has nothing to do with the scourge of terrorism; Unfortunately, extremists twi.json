    "full text": "Ramadan began in much of the world Tuesday, when Muslim clerics announced that the new crescent moon sighted the night before had ushered in the holiest month of the Islamic calendar.\nThat spiritual moment was sadly and cruelly undermined throughout much of the world by the fact that, for a violent few, a time traditionally devoted to a focus on worship and introspection has become an excuse for terror.\nIn the Muslim tradition, Ramadan was the month that God began to reveal the Quran, the Muslim holy book, to the prophet Muhammad more than 1,400 years ago. During daylight hours, observant Muslims abstain from food, drink, smoking and sex so that they may concentrate on the spiritual.\nIt is a time to read the Quran and to perform and be rewarded for good deeds. It is a time of self-denial during the day and festivals at night, a time to contemplate what is holy and to celebrate what is human.\nIn that, it is a tradition deserving of respect, even emulation, among members of all faiths.\nFor security forces around the world, however, this is no time for quiet reflection or joyful celebration. From Bali to Cairo, from Lebanon to London, police and soldiers are on special alert, painfully aware that for followers of al-Qaida and other terrorists, Ramadan is an added motivation - an extra excuse - for murder.\nApparently no tradition is so holy, so sacrosanct, that it cannot be used by those who seek to justify their own hatreds.\nSuch behavior does not do justice to this faith, something that should be apparant to Muslims and non-Muslims alike.\nThe traditions and truths of Islam are best observed during this month - if only more people would bother to look.\n\nLoad-Date: October 5, 2005"
