    "full text": "There is a growing movement in Colombia for a peaceful settlement of the decades-long civil war. A major step forward for a viable peace process will take place this August with the National Conference on Peace to be held in Barrancabermeja, Colombia. This process is being spearheaded by Father Francisco de Roux -- a kind, soft-spoken Jesuit priest whom I met back in 2000.\nThe Jesuit Refugee Service, which has expressed concern for the life of Father de Roux and other Jesuit priests threatened by political violence in Colombia, states the problem well: \"With an ongoing conflict that has killed at least 30,000 civilians and displaced 5 million, Colombia continues to endure the largest and most protracted humanitarian crisis in the Western Hemisphere, and is home to one of the largest displaced populations in the world.\"\nSadly, the United States has never been a force for peace in Colombia. Instead, the United States has chosen to give masses of military aid to Colombia -- more than $7 billion since the year 2000 -- ostensibly to fight drugs and terrorism. In spite of this military aid, the drug flow from Colombia has not decreased; terrorism, especially from right-wing paramilitaries aligned with the very military the United States has been supporting, has not ceased; and the civil war continues in a stalemate.\nIt is now time for the United States to actively support a negotiated peace process in Colombia and support the Father de Roux's of Colombia risking their lives to bring a just peace to that country.\nDANIEL KOVALIK\nHighland Park\n\nNotes\n\nThe writer is a labor and human rights lawyer.\n\nLoad-Date: July 8, 2011"
