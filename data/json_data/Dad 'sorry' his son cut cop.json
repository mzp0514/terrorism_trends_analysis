Officers fired 22 times, striking Camovic eight times and critically wounding him.\nNYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said Thursday it wasn't clear if Camovic actually fired at police. Friendly fire has not been ruled out, officials said.\nOfficer Jean Pierre and two cops who were wounded in the hail of bullets were all hospitalized with minor injuries.\nNo criminal charges have been filed yet against Camovic, who is also being investigated for possible links to terrorism.\nCamovic has no criminal history, but the federal Joint Terrorism Task Force is investigating the Bosnian immigrant's background and whether he is linked to ISIS or other terror groups, sources said.\n\nLoad-Date: June 6, 2020"
