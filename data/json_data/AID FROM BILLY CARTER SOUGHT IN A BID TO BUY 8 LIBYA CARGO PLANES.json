But the panel criticized the President's handling of the Billy Carter affair.\nBilly Carter testified that he never saw the businessmen's letter until he was preparing for his public testimony to the Senate committee last August.\nAl Cahill, an Atlanta real estate developer who sent the letter to Mr. Carter, said in his deposition that the President's brother never responded to the offer.\n''It was a shot in the dark and it didn't work,'' Mr. Cahill testified, adding that he and two other men were trying to buy Libya's eight C-130 cargo planes and sell them at a profit.\nLibya bought the planes in 1974 but they are still parked at the Lockheed Company's plant in Marietta, Ga. The United States has refused to allow their delivery to Libya on the ground that Libya supports international terrorism.\nMr. Cahill testified that he wrote Billy Carter a letter on Jan.  28, 1979, saying, ''There is over a million dollars in earned commissions to be shared by the four of us, referring to himself, Mr. Carter, Stan Carlin of Griffin, Ga., a lawyer, and Moseley Collins, a Florida businessman."
