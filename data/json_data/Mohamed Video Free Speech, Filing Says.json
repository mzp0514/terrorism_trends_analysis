They say the charge does not specify which, if any, terrorist groups would benefit from the video.\nMohamed and Youssef Megahed also are charged with illegally transporting explosives. The two were arrested Aug. 4 in South Carolina after they were pulled over for speeding and deputies found what they said were pipe bombs in the trunk of the car. The nature of the devices has been questioned, with the prosecution saying they were explosive materials and the defense maintaining they were homemade pyrotechnic rockets to be used as fireworks.\nThe explosives charge is set to be the center of a trial scheduled for April 28. Mohamed's terrorism-related charge is scheduled for a separate trial to begin May 12.\nMohamed's attorneys have filed a motion asking a judge to order prosecutors to give specific information about the terrorism-related charge, including the identity of the terrorists he is accused of trying to help.\nIn their 30-page motion to dismiss the terrorism-related charge, attorneys cite the prosecution's description of what was said on the video:\n\"Instead of the brethren going to, to carry out martyrdom operations, no may [God] bless him, he can use the explosion tools from distance and preserve his life, [God] willing, the blessed and exalted, for real battles.\"\nThe defense motion states, \"There is no incitement here. The audience exists only in theory.\"\nFurther, the motion states, it appears the video was posted only briefly on the Internet.\nReporter Elaine Silvestrini can be reached at (813) 259-7837 or esilvestrini@tampatrib.com\nCopyright Â© 2008, The Tampa Tribune and may not be republished without permission.
