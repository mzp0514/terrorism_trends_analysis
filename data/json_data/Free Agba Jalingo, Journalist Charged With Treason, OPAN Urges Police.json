On August 30, the police in Cross River state charged Jalingo with disturbance of public peace and treason for his writings and social media posts about the controversial Cross River Governor, Mr.\n Benedict Ayade. Police arrested Jalingo in Lagos on August 22, 2019. Authorities also charged him with two counts of terrorism, stemming from his alleged plans to work with Omoyele Sowore, \"cult members,\" and a local prince to \"commit acts of terrorism\" to remove Ayade from office, according to the charge sheet.\n \"To equate published criticism of government, policies and politicians with treason is absurd, draconian and outrageous. \"Authorities MUST release Agba Jalingo and other journalists, who are currently in state custody for speaking truth to power and demanding accountability from public office holders, immediately and unconditionally,\" the OPAN statement said.\n\nLoad-Date: September 24, 2019"
