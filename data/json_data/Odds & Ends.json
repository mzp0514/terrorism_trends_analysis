The cover is a gloomy shot of the World Trade Center's twin towers with a police barricade.\nThe calendar is the brainchild of Long Island University professor Harvey Kushner, who doubles as a consultant for various government agencies.\n\"We need to know about terrorism to fight it,\" he said.\nNORTH MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP) - Civic leaders are putting a little distance between body piercing parlors and tourists.\nThe idea is that an impulsive person, especially an impulsive young person, is less likely to have a body part pierced if the person has to hike to the piercer.\n\"A lot of people are spontaneous about things,\" said Councilman Terry White Sr. The City Council voted Monday to send any new piercing shops to an area outside the main tourist center.\nBut J. Michael Hill, president of the American Body Art Association, said the move won't do much good.\nHill, whose 250-member group is based in Kingsport, Tenn., said many piercings and tattoos occur on the spur of the moment, but most folks plan in advance.\n\nLoad-Date: December 15, 1998"
