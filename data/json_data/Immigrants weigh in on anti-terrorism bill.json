    "full text": "Members of several Minnesota immigrant communities said Tuesday they're confident that a state House-Senate conference committee weighing an anti-terrorism bill will hear their concerns about driver's license restrictions.\n     After a two-hour meeting with Rep. Rich Stanek, R-Maple Grove, and House Crime Prevention Committee administrator Chuck Noerenberg, Omar Jamal and Jorge Saavedra said they have fresh hope that the proposed legislation will be changed to avoid targeting and penalizing lawful immigrants.\n   \"This was a great step forward in a positive way, after a series of steps backwards,\" said Saavedra, a lawyer and executive director of Centro Legal in St. Paul.\n     The bill would mark driver's licenses of immigrants with a distinctive color to signal their status to law enforcement officials. But Saavedra and Jamal, executive director of the Somali Justice Advocacy Center in St. Paul, said the color could make it harder for immigrants to rent an apartment or get services.\n     They suggested instead that a different code be devised that police could recognize without revealing one's immigrant status to others.\n          Jamal and Saavedra said they hope the bill requires the Legislature to collect information on how it works and return next year with changes.\n\nLoad-Date: April 24, 2002"
