    "full text": "UNITED NATIONS - Iran's president used the world's stage on Wednesday to warn that security in the Persian Gulf could unravel with a \"single blunder\" and its fragile peace be guaranteed only by the region's countries, not through U.S. intervention or Washington's \"merciless economic terrorism.\"\nPresident Hassan Rouhani accused the United States of engaging in \"international piracy\" against his country by re-imposing economic sanctions after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.\nTehran \"will never negotiate with an enemy that seeks to make Iran surrender with the weapon of poverty,\" Rouhani said in his highly anticipated speech at the U.N. General Assembly. \"Stop the sanctions so as to open the way for the start of negotiations.\"\nHis words came shortly after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced additional U.S. sanctions targeting Iran's ability to sell its oil, this time imposing penalties on six Chinese companies and their chief executives for continuing to transport Iranian crude.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. and Japan on Wednesday signed a limited trade deal that will eliminate tariffs and expand market access on farm, industrial and digital products. But the deal does not address autos, a key sticking point during months of contentious negotiations.\n\nLoad-Date: September 27, 2019"
