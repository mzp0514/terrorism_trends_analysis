Suzie Bassi, will feature a panel of local officials talking about what measures are being taken in the Northwest suburbs to ensure the public's safety in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.  \nA question and answer session will follow the presentation.  \nPanelists include officials from Northwest Community Hospital, the Cook County Department of Public Health, a disaster specialist from the American Red Cross, and police and fire chiefs from Palatine and Rolling Meadows.  \nBassi decided to organize the event because so many people are frightened about the possibility of more attacks and are curious to know how local government agencies and hospitals would respond in a crisis.  \n\"It's so people can have a comfort level,\" Bassi said.  \nThe forum also will offer guidance to parents on how to talk to their children about terrorism-related issues.  \nFor more information, contact Bassi's office at (847) 776-1880.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nSuzi Bassi\n\nLoad-Date: November 6, 2001"
