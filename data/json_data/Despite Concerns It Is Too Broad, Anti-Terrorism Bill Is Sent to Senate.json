    "full text": "Utah House members approved a tough new Utah anti-terrorism bill Tuesday, sending it to the Senate for consideration.\nSkeptics said the legislation is too broad, sweeping up some garden-variety crimes in its attempt to get at terrorists or those making hoax threats of mass destruction.\nSupporters acknowledge the bill is harsh but insist it is tailored to focus in on the intended class of criminals.\n\"We're trying to put some teeth in the terrorism law that we have,\" sponsoring Rep. Paul Ray, R-Clinton, told his colleagues.\nAttorney General Mark Shurtleff said his office drafted the measure after the Sept. 11 attacks and it is a valuable tool for prosecutors. While federal prosecutors are aggressively going after terroristic crimes, including anthrax hoaxes, Shurtleff said a state law is needed.\n\"We'd rather have our laws and charge them locally,\" he said.\nShurtleff admitted that the legislation could be used to bring felony charges against bomb threat hoaxers but said prosecutors would use discretion.\n\"The bill appears to make the crime of simple assault a terroristic threat,\" said Rep. Scott Daniels, D-Salt Lake City, a former state judge.\nThe argument failed, with the Republican-controlled House voting down his amendment to delete the section dealing with assault.\nIn the end, the bill passed on a 69-1 vote.\n\nLoad-Date: March 6, 2002"
