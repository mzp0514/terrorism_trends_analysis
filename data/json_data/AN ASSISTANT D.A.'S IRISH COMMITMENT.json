    "full text": "To the Editor:\nAllow me to assure Andrew Hall (letter Nov. 30) that no incongruity arises from my employment in the legal profession and simultaneous service as publicity director for Irish Northern Aid.\nMy commitment to law stems from my belief that in a democratic nation law is the guarantor of inalienable rights and liberties, and is therefore the foundation of peace and freedom as well as justice.\nNew York City assistant district attorney Martin Galvin letter, in response to Andrew Hall's November 30 letter, comments on his Irish commitment\nBritish colonial rule in Ireland is based upon military terrorism and a denial of the primary democratic legal principle, the right of each people to govern itself in freedom. It fosters sectarian privilege rather than equal rights, and its legal procedures are instruments of repression rather than a guarantee of justice. It is British colonial rule that has imposed eight centuries of struggle upon Ireland.\nI fervently wish to see peace in Ireland, which cannot be attained without freedom and justice. I therefore oppose British rule in Ireland and support Irish Northern Aid.\nMy views as a lawyer are not unique. A similar philosophy accounted for more than half of the signatories of the American Declaration of Independence being lawyers. Because of their efforts, I possess the First Amendment right of freedom of speech. I intend to exercise that right until British colonial rule in Ireland is ended, regardless of whether these aspirations are shared by readers or editors of The Times.\nMARTIN GALVIN New York, Dec. 8, 1981.\nThe writer is a New York City assistant district attorney."
