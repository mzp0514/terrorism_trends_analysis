The conference was addressed by prominent leaders and scholars in Indonesia, as well as speakers from many countries in South East Asia, South Asia, North Africa, Middle East, Europe, and USA. This was organized by Malaysia based Islam &Liberty; Network, in partnership with Fatayat Nahdlatul Ulama, International Institute of Advanced Islamic Studies and Religious Freedom Institute. \nAddressing the conference, K.H. Said Aqil Siradi, Chairman of Nahdatul Ulama, Indonesia, remarked that Islam intrinsically embodies the meaning and concept of peace. He said that Islam talks about the Ummah not as separate Islamic states and systems. Ummah is a concept that encompasses civilization, pluralism, diversity and acceptance. The Prophet of Islam built Ummah on the basis of those values and principles. Islam is against terrorism and aggression. It promotes religious pluralism, human dignity and diversity.\nProminent scholar of Islamic law, Dr. Mohammad Hashim Kamali, CEO, IAIS, Malaysia, talked about the Freedom of Religion and Apostasy: Issues, Responses and Developments. He gave a brief overview of the classical, medieval and modern juristic opinions about the religious freedom and apostasy. He said that the Prophetic traditions (Ahadith) quoted in favour of the punishment of apostasy are misunderstood by ignoring the context and background. He also said that the state should distance itself from closely identifying itself with religion.\nAnggia Ermarini, the general chairman of Fatayat Nahdlatul Ulama, and Member of Parliament, said that Indonesia has diversity based on the values of inclusivity and acceptance. Stable constitutional and political institutions have been playing pivotal role especially in this respect. \nAli Salman, CEO of Islam &Liberty; Network, said that this Network is working on exploring and promoting Muslim case of liberty in the Muslim-majority countries. He added that Charter of Madinah is an excellent and inspiring example of Islamic case of freedom which guaranteed religious freedom to all segments of the society and followers of all religious traditions and faiths in the newly established polity in Madinah. \nDr. Tim Shah, Vice President of Religious Freedom Institute, said that religious freedom is good and beneficial for faith, democracy and human prosperity. He said that where there is less religious freedom there exists instability, terrorism and insurgency. He showed concern that no Muslim governments are speaking on the treatment given to Uyghur Muslims in China or Rohingya in Myanmar and Muslims in Sri Lanka. Religious freedom should be manifested in many levels such as the housing system, the education system and the working opportunities.\nAddressing the conference, Professor Robert Hefner remarked that Islam provides several powerful foundations to guarantee religious freedom, such as the possibility of interpretation (Ijtihad) and Sharia Law, which affirms that Islam is definitely for religious freedom. Zainal Abidin Bagir, an Indonesian scholar argued that several Muslim countries fare very poorly on the blasphemy law and showed concerns on what he termed as increasing number of blasphemy cases.   \nSpeakers in the 7th Islam &Liberty; Conference came from different countries in South East Asia, South Asia, North Africa, Middle East, Europe and the USA.
