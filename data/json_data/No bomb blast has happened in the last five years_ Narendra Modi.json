He said, \"We managed to contain terrorism to just two and a half districts in Jammu and Kashmir.\"\n\nSpeaking about Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's statement of trying to approach India after the Balakot air strike Modi said that the leader had to make a public plea to us to pick up the phone.\n\nFurther, while hitting out at the previous Congress-led governments in the country, Modi said that had the Sardar Sarovar project been completed 40 years ago Gujarat would have been much better. He said that in 2014, the Congress came to its lowest rally after Independence and in 2019, it is fighting on the lowest number of Lok Sabha seats but still dreaming of becoming the ruling party. The Prime Minister also said that the tallest statue of Sardar Patel built in Gujarat was not intended to disrespect late Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru adding that \"this is not an election rally for me but a rally to say thanks to people of Gujarat for the grooming I received here.\"\n\nLoad-Date: April 18, 2019"
