    "full text": "To the Editor:\nDomestic terrorism is a terrible paradox. The Department of Justice, through the Federal Bureau of Investigation, has acted with dispatch in seeking the people who bombed the World Trade Center. Yet this same agency has casually ignored the terrorist organizations that we have come to call the antiabortion movement as they have carried out, in the last dozen years, scores of bombings and vandalizings of women's clinics.\nThe murder of Dr. David Gunn in Pensacola, Fla., may at last discredit these violent groups, yet as recently as last summer's Democratic National Convention, New York's John Cardinal O'Connor joined a march sponsored by one of these groups, and not a single member of Congress has yet had the courage to declare that violent protests against women and their physicians exercising their constitutional rights are terrorism.\nThe paradox of terrorism is that we prefer to regard some causes as favorites, as a rebellion against oppression, like the acts of the Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland, while at the same time religious and legislative leaders comfortably ignore, even condone, America's incessant antiabortion terrorism.\nFor the Department of Justice, Congress and religious leaders to sanction terrorism against women and their physicians, shows the double standard our leaders apply to domestic terrorism.\nWho can doubt that the same kind of investigation that led to arrests in the World Trade Center blast would root out the terrorists of the right-to-life movement?\n \nPAUL J. KORSHIN\nPhiladelphia, March 12, 1993\n\nLoad-Date: March 24, 1993"
