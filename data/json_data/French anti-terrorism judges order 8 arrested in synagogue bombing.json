    "full text": "French anti-terrorism judges ordered the arrest Tuesday of eight suspects in a deadly Tunisia synagogue bombing that authorities have linked to the al-Qaida terrorist network. Among those detained were the parents and brother of the suspected bomber.\nNineteen people, including 14 German tourists, were killed when a truck laden with gas tanks exploded outside the Ghriba synagogue on the Tunisian island of Djerba.\nFrench Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy said in a statement that documents seized during the arrests Tuesday near the southern city of Lyon appeared to be directly related to the April 11 explosion.\nFrench authorities believe the driver of the truck was a Tunisian identified as Nizar Naouar. He is believed to have carried out the attack with an unidentified accomplice who also lived in the North African country.\nNaouar is thought to have died in the explosion, but officials have not said what happened to his alleged accomplice.\nAmong those detained Tuesday were Naouar's parents and his brother, Walid Naouar, 22, said prosecutor Christian Hassensrat.\nThree other people close to the family also were detained.\nThe suspects were taken into custody in Lyon for questioning. Under France's new anti-terrorism law, authorities can hold the suspects up to four days without charging them.\nPolice in Lyon said it was too soon to determine if the family played any role in the attack but their arrests had been planned for some time because of their \"peripheral interest\" to the case.\nAt the time of the attack, members of the Naouar family said they were shocked at their relative's alleged connection to the explosion.\n\nLoad-Date: November 6, 2002"
