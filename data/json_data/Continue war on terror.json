    "full text": "We cannot let the terrorists win. The struggle against Islamic terrorism is a noble cause, to save America and the American way of life.\nWe will win despite all the protest marchers and radical leftist groups such as MoveOn.org, and the Cindy Sheehans who think their rhetoric will destroy President Bush's strong resolve.\nSome feel we are making \"sacrifices\" for security. What about the many firemen and policemen and 3,000 innocent people who were sacrificed on 9-11?\nWhat we are being asked to do is so little. We are in for the long haul.\nOur goal in Iraq is against terrorism; to spread freedom and democracy. We cannot appease these terrorists. If this country forgets that, we will lose and suffer the consequences.\nThe more the suffering, the greater the terrorist rejoices. The war on terrorism must go on. This is a battle against barbarism and civilization.\nWe have a great responsibility to win our struggle against insurgent Islamist aggression, as we had to win World War II. If we do not pay with our sacrifices now, our children and grandchildren will pay in greater numbers later.\nWe must not let those pacifists and anti-war, anti-America groups in this country take away our basic right; the right to defend our country and its people.\nAlberta Gamble\nWinterport\n\nLoad-Date: October 18, 2005"
