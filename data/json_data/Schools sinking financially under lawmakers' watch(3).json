EndresPhiladelphiaAre Muslims really the only terrorists?Generally, terrorism is defined as the use of violence against civilians to effect political change.What was the Arlington, Va., shooting all about, if not to effect political change? James T. Hodgkinson was a well-known political activist.He opened fire with a rifle and hit five people because he evidently didn't like the policies of the Republicans and, specifically, President Trump himself. \nHe wanted change; he was making a statement for change through violence. Terrorism - propaganda by the deed.I have yet to read the word \"terrorism\" to describe this incident in any report. If Hodgkinson had yelled \"Allahu Akbar\" before his shots, or if his name sounded Middle Eastern, we'd be all over the terrorism angle of the case.What is Hodgkinson's religion? You can bet we'd know if he were a Muslim. Why do I never hear of a Christian terrorist, or a Jewish terrorist, but only a Muslim terrorist?John WatersHavertown, Pa. \n\nLoad-Date: July 4, 2017"
