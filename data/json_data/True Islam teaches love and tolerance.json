I completely grasp and feel the atrocity of the recent attacks on the nightclub in Orlando, which is by far the worst attack in the recent American history. \nISIS, radical Islam, Islamist terrorism, radical Islamist terrorism, or “just” terrorism, whatever we want to name it, we all need to admit that terrorism is a real threat to the world peace. Whenever these kinds of attacks happen I always see social media going crazy over whom to blame for all these heinous acts of terrorism and violence against humanity. One thing that strikes me most is the engrossment of our young generation in almost all of the incidents. I find myself in a great agony having this very sad realization that most of our young people are leaning towards radicalization and violence. \nFor the sake of our next generation we need to join our forces as Muslims, Christians, Jews, Hindus, Sikhs, or atheists; white, black, yellow, pink, orange, or whatever color, it's time to stop the hate and animosity. The only way to defeat radicalization and especially Islamist terrorism is to stand together and spread the message of love for all and hatred for none; let's coexist. \nNamoode Khokher, Bloomington \n\nLoad-Date: July 15, 2021"
