Cuba said it sent investigators to the home who found no potential source.\nIn all, two individuals are considered \"potentially new cases\" but have not yet been \"medically confirmed,\" a State Department official said. Doctors from the University of Pennsylvania have been evaluating, treating and studying Americans affected in Cuba last year.\n6 terrorism suspects reportedly killed in Iran - Iran's official news agency said members of the powerful Revolutionary Guard have killed six terrorism suspects near the border with Iraq.\nIRNA's Sunday report quotes Gen. Mohammad Pakpour, chief of the Guard's ground forces, as saying that his forces also injured three suspects in the incident Saturday.\nHe said the clashes happened at two locations in a Kurdish area as the suspects tried to cross the Iraqi border.\nSyrian leader says West fueling war - Syrian President Bashar Assad said in an interview published Sunday that the West is fueling the devastating war in his country, now in its eighth year, with the aim of toppling him.\nAssad told The Mail on Sunday that Western nations have lied about chemical attacks in Syria and supported terrorists groups there, while Russia has supported his government against the foreign \"invasion.\"\nAssad reiterated his long-held position that the uprising against his rule was part of a plot to remove a leader that did not go along with Western policies in the region.\nSyria's conflict began in 2011, and has claimed nearly half a million lives.\nIsrael destroys land-to-sea tunnel - Israel destroyed a tunnel dug by Hamas leading from Gaza into the Mediterranean Sea intended for use by the Islamic militant group that rules the territory to carry out attacks, the military said Sunday.\nMilitary spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus said that last week aircraft struck a position belonging to Hamas' naval forces in northern Gaza that incapacitated its first-of-a-kind tunnel to the sea.\nHe said it was designed to allow divers to slip out of Gaza and attack Israeli targets.\nIsrael has placed a high priority on eliminating the tunnel threat since Hamas gunmen infiltrated Israel during the 2014 war. Although they did not manage to reach civilian areas, the infiltrations caught Israel off guard, with one attack killing five soldiers and terrifying the local population.\nThere was no immediate response from Hamas.\nAdvocate for Rohingya wins humanitarian prize - A lawyer from Myanmar who has worked to promote the rights of the country's persecuted Rohingya minority has been awarded the $1.1 million Aurora Prize for humanitarianism.\nKyaw Hia Aung on Sunday received the prize, which was established on behalf of Armenian survivors of a mass killing by Ottoman Turks.\nAn estimated 1.5 million Armenians were killed in 1915-23 in what many historians regard as the first genocide of the 20th century, a claim that Turkey vehemently rejects.\nAung, a lawyer, has worked for decades for Myanmar's Rohingya population. Some 700,000 Rohingya have fled to makeshift refugee camps in Bangladesh. He served 12 years in prison for his work, the foundation said.\nThe prize includes $100,000 for Aung and $1 million for him to donate to organizations of his choice.\nHurricane Bud growing in Pacific off Mexico - Hurricane Bud formed in the Pacific Ocean west of Mexico on Sunday even as former Hurricane Aletta was fading. Neither immediately threatened land, though Bud was expected to kick up high surf along the Mexican coast and potentially could reach the Los Cabos resort region by Thursday or Friday.\nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center said Bud had maximum sustained winds of 75 mph at midafternoon Sunday. It was centered about 255 miles south of Manzanillo, Mexico, and was moving northwest at 9 mph.\nForecasters said Bud likely would strengthen over the next few days but was expected to weaken back to a tropical storm once it reached the cooler waters near the Baja California Peninsula.\nMeanwhile, Tropical Storm Aletta's winds were down to 45 mph. It peaked on Friday as a Category 4 hurricane.\nThousands attend anti-corruption rally in Romania - Some 3,000 protesters gathered in the Romanian capital to oppose official corruption a day after a massive government rally against anti-corruption prosecutors.\nDemonstrators yelled \"Justice, not corruption!\" and lit up the sky with their mobile phones as night fell in Bucharest on Sunday.\nMore than 100,000 supporters of the center-left government rallied in the same spot Saturday, claiming anti-corruption prosecutors had too much power. The anti-corruption agency successfully prosecuted 713 officials in 2016, including 28 mayors and a senator.\nFire engulfs warehouse with Iraq's election ballots - A fire engulfed a depot on Sunday where ballots from Iraq's national elections were being stored ahead of a full manual recount, the latest setback for a process that had already been mired in accusations of fraud and other violations.\nThe blaze sent black plumes that could be seen for miles around the capital. There were fears that the destruction of ballots further risks the legitimacy of last month's election, which saw a major shift in Iraq's political order.\nSaad Maan, a spokesman for Iraq's interior ministry, said the fire had broken out in one of four storage facilities for ballots, and that the three depots with the majority of returns had been spared.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n Iraqi security forces guard ballot boxes after a fire that broke out at Baghdad's largest ballot box storage site, where ballots from Iraq's May parliamentary elections are stored, in Baghdad, Iraq, Sunday, June 10, 2018.
