This a collective fight,\" he said. \"As we always defend the freedom to practice Islam in France ... we are also determined to fight against extremism and terrorism.\"\nThe current controversy, which has seen protests in parts of the Mideast and South Asia, comes amid heightened tensions over the caricatures published in French newspaper Charlie Hebdo, as well as French President Emmanuel Macron's policies toward freedom of expression and Islamism. There were no protests in Cairo and other major Arab capitals.\nThe French diplomat met Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, a close ally of Macron, and Foreign Minister Sahmeh Shukry. During the meeting, El-Sissi emphasized the need to promote \"coexistence and tolerance\" among religions, his office said.\nLe Drian also met with Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, the Sunni Muslim world's foremost religious institution.\nEl-Tayeb reiterated his stance that \"insulting our Prophet Muhammad\" cannot be classified as freedom of expression, referring to the Charlie Hebdo caricatures.\nLe Drian said he held talks with Egyptian officials to reiterate France's respect to Islam and the \"full role\" Muslims play in French society.\nLate last month, el-Tayeb called for a universal legislation criminalizing discrimination against Muslims, and urged Muslims to resort to peaceful and legal means to \"resist hate speech.\"\nHe also condemned the extremist attacks in France, and called the decapitation last month of a French middle school teacher \"an odious and painful murder.\" The teacher had shown caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad for a class on free speech.\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.
