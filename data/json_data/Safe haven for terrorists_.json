The terrorists responsible for this cowardly act were caught and convicted.\n#DANDOLT.LIB#Then in a disgraceful act of greed, former Panamanian President Moscoso granted pardons to these terrorists in exchange for money. It was an act denounced by many in Latin America, yet applauded by a few in both Miami and Washington, D.C.\nThose few included George W. Bush and Cuban criminal elements in Miami who have welcomed these men into the U.S. In a mockery of the U.S. war on terror, they have applied for political asylum, seeking to halt deportation to Cuba, home to the 73 victims.\nGeorge Bush once stated, \"Any nation which harbors terrorists must be held accountable.\" An explanation is owed to the families of victims and those fighting terrorism, as Bush and Homeland Security allow terrorists on U.S. soil.\nThe recent recommendations by the 9/11 Commission were intended to protect Americans from terrorists. Inter-agency cooperation was not meant to protect \"friendly\" terrorists from justice. There cannot be good or bad terrorists, all terrorism is wrong!\nA child killed or maimed in a terrorist attack cannot differentiate between good or bad and, as moral Americans, neither should we. Before the U.S. can stop terror, it must stop offering a safe haven for terrorists!\nDan Dolt\nEast Lampeter Township\n\nLoad-Date: April 21, 2005"
