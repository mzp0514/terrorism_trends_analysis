    "full text": "To the Editor:\n  As a Muslim-American elected official, I am appalled that Rudolph W. Giuliani chose to equate all terrorists with members of the Islamic faith during his G.O.P. convention address. \n  He said: ''For four days in Denver, the Democrats were afraid to use the term 'Islamic terrorism.' '' I imagine they believe it is politically incorrect to say it. I think they believe they will insult someone. Please tell me, who they are insulting if they say, 'Islamic terrorism.' They are insulting terrorists!'' \n  Sorry, Rudy. That statement doesn't insult terrorists; it insults all hard-working, loyal Muslim-Americans. Worse still,  none of the convention pundits or commentators for any major paper or network called him on it.\n  Several Democratic speakers, including Barack Obama, did address the serious issue of the fight against terrorism, but they did it in a way that did not imply that all Muslim people are terrorists. Mr. Giuliani doesn't seem to know better. \n  Every day, Muslim-Americans serve our country in the armed forces, help us create tighter security systems that protect all Americans, and create jobs  for  hundreds of thousands of Americans. \n  The fight against terrorism should be directed toward real terrorists and those who support them, not toward people trying to live the American dream but who follow a different faith.\n  Whatever happened to the principle of religious freedom upon which the United States was founded?  Saqib Ali \n  Annapolis, Md., Sept. 5, 2008\n  The writer is a member of the Maryland House of Delegates.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: September 9, 2008"
