ELF is an underground movement with no public leadership, membership or spokesperson.\nThe British-based SHAC describes itself as a worldwide campaign since 1999 to rescue animals tortured in research labs and shut down the businesses that rely on their use. It says it \"does not encourage or incite illegal activity.\"\nLewis said the FBI concluded that after analyzing all types of cases and comparing the groups with \"right-wing extremists, KKK, anti-abortion groups and the like.\" He said most animal rights and eco-extremists so far have refrained from violence targeting human life.\n\"The FBI has observed troubling signs that this is changing. We have seen an escalation in violent rhetoric and tactics,\" he told the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. \"Attacks are also growing in frequency and size.\"\nSen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., the panel's chairman, said he hoped to examine more closely how the groups might be getting assistance in fundraising and communications from tax-exempt organizations' \"mainstream activists\" not directly blamed for the violence.\n\"Just like al-Qaida or any other terrorist organization, ELF and ALF cannot accomplish their goals without money, membership and the media,\" Inhofe said.\nThe FBI said 35 of its offices have 150 open investigations, with activists claiming credit for 1,200 crimes between 1990 and mid-2004.\n\nLoad-Date: May 20, 2005"
