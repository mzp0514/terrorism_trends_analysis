He said American advisers were training counterterrorism units in the Philippines, Yemen, and the former Soviet republic of Georgia, and have \"captured and interrogated thousands of terrorists.\"\nThe President did not mention bin Laden, whose survival and whereabouts resurfaced as an issue last week with the broadcast of a new audiotape attributed to the Saudi-born fugitive accused of masterminding the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Nor did he specifically mention new FBI warnings that bin Laden's al-Qaeda network may be planning \"spectacular attacks\" inside the United States.\nBush said \"the threat of terror will be with us for years to come, and we remain resolved to see this conflict through to the end.\"\n\nLoad-Date: November 17, 2002"
