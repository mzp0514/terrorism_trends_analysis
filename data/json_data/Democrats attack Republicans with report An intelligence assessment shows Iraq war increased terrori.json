    "full text": "Democrats on Sunday seized on an intelligence assessment that said the Iraq war has increased the threat of terrorism, saying it was further evidence that Americans should choose new leadership in the November elections.\nThe Democrats hoped the report would undermine the GOP's image as the party more capable of handing terrorism as the campaign enters its final six-week stretch.\nTheir criticisms came in a collection of statements sent to reporters Sunday amid the disclosure of a National Intelligence Estimate that concluded the war has helped create a new generation of Islamic radicalism and that the overall terrorism threat has grown since the Sept. 11 attacks.\nThe report was completed in April and represented a consensus view of the 16 disparate spy services inside government, according to an intelligence official. The official, confirming accounts first published in Sunday's New York Times and Washington Post, spoke on condition of anonymity on Sunday because the report is classified.\n\"Unfortunately this report is just confirmation that the Bush administration's stay-the-course approach to the Iraq war has not just made the war more difficult and more deadly for our troops, but has also made the war on terror more dangerous for every American,\" said Rep. Rahm Emanuel, head of the Democratic effort to take control of the House.\n\"Press reports say our nation's intelligence services have confirmed that President Bush's repeated missteps in Iraq and his stubborn refusal to change course have made America less safe,\" said Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid. \"No election-year White House PR campaign can hide this truth.\"\nIn a statement issued Sunday afternoon, Bush's national intelligence director, John Negroponte, said, \"What we have said, time and again, is that while there is much that remains to be done in the war on terror, we have achieved some notable successes against the global jihadist threat.\"\nHe added, \"The conclusions of the intelligence community are designed to be comprehensive, and viewing them through the narrow prism of a fraction of judgments distorts the broad framework they create.\"\nDemocrats said Bush had misled people about Iraq's contribution to the terrorist threat.\n\"It is abundantly clear that we need a new direction in Iraq by strategically redeploying our troops to fight and win the real war on terror and make our country safer,\" said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. \"The American people know it, and our military leaders do as well. It's only the Republican leaders who have their heads in the sand, stubbornly refusing to change course and making the war on terror harder to win.\"\nRep. Jane Harman, of California, the leading Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee and one of a few lawmakers to have read the classified report, said she agrees with the findings.\n\"Even capturing the remaining top al-Qaida leadership isn't going to prevent copycat cells, and it isn't going to change a failed policy in Iraq,\" she said. \"This administration is trying to change the subject. I don't think voters are going to buy that.\"\nThree leading Republicans - Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, of Tennessee, Sen. John McCain, of Arizona and Sen. Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky - defended the war in Iraq and said it is vital that U.S. troops stay in the fight. None of them had seen the classified report, but were responding to press coverage of it.\nMcConnell suggested that the fight in Iraq has stopped terrorists from attacking the U.S. and leaving would only create \"a breeding ground for attacks here at home.\"\n\"Attacks here at home stopped when we started fighting al-Qaida where they live, rather than responding after they hit,\" McConnell said in a statement.\nMcCain told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that if the U.S. were to fail in Iraq, \"then our problems will be much more complicated.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \nHarry Reid John Negroponte\n\nLoad-Date: October 10, 2006"
