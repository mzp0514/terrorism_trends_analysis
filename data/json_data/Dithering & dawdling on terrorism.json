    "full text": "In light of the coordinated bombings in Brussels, the world has a clear understanding regarding Islamic terrorists. They are not individuals or groups of individuals or enemy combatants acting on their own but for a state. We may not recognize ISIS as a bona fide country, but it is a state possessing land, an economy, a military and all the components of statehood. \nISIS soldiers must apply then swear an allegiance, followed by basic and possibly specialized training either within their borders or by someone trained by ISIS or by following an ISIS combat manual. A hierarchical structure provides command and control of strategy, movement, attack, etc. If individual Americans choose to become ISIS soldiers, they forfeit their citizenship and become an enemy governed by the rules of war. \nThere is an abundance of intelligence information publicly reported and we have witnessed the horrific results of orchestrated military attacks by ISIS soldiers operating within the borders of the United States. So why are Congress and President Obama dithering? One of the primary roles of our federal government is to protect citizens from enemies, yet they continue to dawdle regarding border security and active engagement of ISIS's military forces both at home and abroad. \nI have pledged my allegiance to the United States of America. Now the United States of America better step up and protect me from those who pledged allegiance to ISIS. \nRev. James Holland \nThe writer is pastor of Transfiguration Parish in West Deer \n\nLoad-Date: April 3, 2016"
