They don't lock their doors.\nThat's going to have to change, a top U.S. Department of Agriculture official said Monday.\n\"It's going to take a lot to change the mindset of a lot of people,\" said Jim Moseley, deputy U.S. agriculture secretary. \"The threats are real. Nine-eleven was not the end. Nine-eleven was the beginning.\"\nMoseley spoke before a crowd of about 150 representatives from 13 states at the Midwest Governors' Conference summit on agricultural terrorism. Speakers at the two-day summit led by Nebraska Gov. Mike Johanns and Missouri Gov. Bob Holden included scientific experts and federal and state officials.\n\"Located in the Heartland, we have never felt we were the target of our foreign enemies,\" said Moseley, a former Indiana pork producer. \"I have to tell you with all sincerity, this is one farmer who now understands the risk.\"\nThe summit's genesis can be traced more than a year ago to the outbreak in Europe of the fatal livestock disease foot-and-mouth. Then came the terrorist attacks last fall.\n\"We quickly realized the importance of collaboration,\" said Johanns, chairman of the Midwest Governors' Conference.\nSome farm states already have taken steps. Holden noted he signed into law this year a measure that makes agriculture terrorism, such as spreading diseases among livestock, a felony in Missouri.\nOther Midwestern states must also begin building an infrastructure to protect the nation's farms and food supply against terrorist attacks, said Holden, vice chairman of the conference.\nKent Kutnink, a Kansas City, Mo.-based regulatory manager with farm chemical distributor Agriliance LLC of St. Paul, Minn., said farmers can take simple steps to prevent terrorism.\n\"That could mean having a fence around a locked building that contains your chemicals, and locking up your most â€¦ volatile chemicals within the locked building,\" Kutnink said. \"That's three barriers of protection.\"\nMembers of the Midwest Governors' Conference besides Nebraska and Missouri are Kansas, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky.\n\nLoad-Date: July 31, 2002"
