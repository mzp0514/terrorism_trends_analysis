    "full text": "A 29-year-old Jordanian national has been sentenced to 3 1/2 years in federal prison for leading a mortgage fraud and money laundering scheme with several others.\nAlaa \"Alex\" Ramadan, who has lived in Salt Lake City, was sentenced Tuesday as part of a plea agreement struck with prosecutors. Last October, Ramadan pleaded guilty to numerous violations of federal law stemming from mortgage, loan, credit card, wire and mail frauds and money laundering that generated thousands of dollars.\nIn U.S. District Court Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Dale Kimball also ordered Ramadan to pay $23,348 in back taxes for 2000; $2,389 for 2001, and $27,134 for 2002.\nThe case was investigated by the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force for possible ties to terrorism.\nInitially FBI agents said Ramadan and several of his relatives were involved in a money laundering scheme in which funds were being wired back to Jordan. Agents said Ramadan's brother, who had been captured in Iraq, had suspected ties to al-Qaida.\nFederal prosecutors said they have found no evidence that the money laundering and fraud were tied to terrorism.\nRamadan, who has been in federal custody, will serve 60 months supervised release after serving his sentence and will then be deported back to Jordan.\n\nLoad-Date: February 24, 2007"
