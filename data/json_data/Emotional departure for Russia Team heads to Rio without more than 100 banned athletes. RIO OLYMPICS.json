If there were ever a headache for anti-terror forces, it's the Olympics.\nIn the aftermath of deadly attacks by the Islamic State group in France and elsewhere, Brazil, which has almost no experience com-batting terrorism, is beefing up security for the games that start in Rio de Janeiro on Aug. 5. Plans include doubling the number of security forces on the streets, erecting more checkpoints and working closer with foreign intelligence agencies than Brazilians did in the 2014 World Cup.\nBut will it be enough?\nRichard Ford, a retired FBI anti-terror expert who lives in Brazil, said that while the government has a robust program to keep athletes and venues safe, he worries that authorities aren't taking the threat of a lone-wolf or suicide attack seriously enough.\nHe cited comments by Justice Minister Alexandre de Moraes, who surprised many last week by saying the chances of a terror attack at the games were \"next to zero\" and that the bigger concern is street crime. Just a day later, the federal police overseen by Moraes arrested 10 Brazilians allegedly belonging to an amateur cell that had professed allegiance to ISIS over the internet.\n\"It's very naive to think that the risks for terrorism are minimal,\" said Ford, who has worked on security at several Olympic Games.\n\nLoad-Date: July 29, 2016"
