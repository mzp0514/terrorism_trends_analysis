    "full text": "A bomb found Saturday at a construction site at the Home Depot corporate headquarters in Cobb County may have been the work of domestic terrorists, the FBI said Wednesday.\nThe bomb was found atop a piece of heavy construction equipment that, had the device exploded, would have been destroyed, said FBI spokeswoman Celestine Armstead.\nConstitutionInstead, the bomb was rendered inoperative by the Cobb police bomb squad.\n\"Because it was a live device, we have to assume that it was an act of terrorism,\" Armstead said, noting that the FBI has primary investigative jurisdiction in cases involving domestic terrorism. The agency will work with Cobb police and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in the investigation, she said.\nAlso found at the site was the spray-painted name of an environmental protest group, Armstead said. As recently as May, groups including the Rainbow Action Network, Greenpeace and the Sierrra Club held demonstrations at the company's corporate headquarters to protest the sale of \"old growth\" lumber.\n\"No one has actually claimed responsibility\" for the bomb, Armstead said.\nThe FBI is asking anyone with information about the incident, or who may have seen anything suspicious at the site between 10 p.m. Friday and 6 a.m. Saturday, to call Cobb police at 770-499-3900 or the FBI at 404-679-9000.\n\nLoad-Date: July 8, 1999"
