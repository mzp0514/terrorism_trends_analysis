The building supply store has replenished its stock of wood posts.\nBut the investigation into the arson at Stock Building Supply early Monday -- and possible links to domestic terrorism -- is just getting under way.\nOn Wednesday, KSL News Radio 1160 received a fax, whose sender claims to be with the Earth Liberation Front.\nThe fax, received at 4:44 p.m., indicates the ELF started the fires, which destroyed a warehouse at 1300 W. 9000 South, because the company failed to decrease the pollutants released by their forklifts.\n\"We will continue in our mission to stop large companies from destroying the environment,\" the fax reads.\nThe fax also named four Salt Lake area companies that are future targets. The companies include a car dealership and a lumber store.\nKSL gave the fax to the FBI and other law enforcement agencies, which are investigating the arson, said news director Russ Hill.\nInvestigators found the letters \"ELF\" spray painted in green twice on the back of the company's main building and once on a delivery truck when they were called to the blaze at about 1:40 a.m. on Monday.\nThe ELF is a loose alliance of militants who promote illegal actions in defense of the environment and have been linked to vandalism and arson at SUV dealerships, timber companies and construction sites.\nFBI special agent Ray Mey said eco-terrorists have recently become more violent.\n\"We see their conviction becoming more focused,\" he said. \"They are very dangerous.\"\nThe FBI issued a bulletin last week to all of its offices warning about potential ELF attacks, prompted by the recent conviction in Oregon of an arsonist with ties to the ELF.\nFederal authorities say the ELF and an affiliated animal rights group called the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) have committed more than 1,100 illegal acts since 1976, causing more than $ 110 million in damage.\nDetectives say they are not focusing their investigation solely on the group.\nFire officials are asking anyone with information about the case to call 1-877-57-ARSON.\nmcanham@sltrib.com  \n\nGraphic\n\n \nAgent Ray Mey, of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, ducks under police tape at Stock Building Supply, 1300 W. 9000 South in West Jordan.
