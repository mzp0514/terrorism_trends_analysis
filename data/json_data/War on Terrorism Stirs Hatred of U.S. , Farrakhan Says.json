    "full text": "Louis Farrakhan, the leader of The Nation of Islam, has condemned the war on terrorism and says it could ignite hatred of the United States throughout the Muslim world.\n     In a speech here on Sunday to thousands of followers, Mr. \nFarrakhan said the United States' \"insatiable appetite for oil\" had led it to destabilize Muslim governments and back repressive ones. \n He also predicted that the Bush administration would go to war with Iraq, one of three nations the president described last month as a component in an \"axis of evil.\"\n\"President Bush does intend to go into Iraq,\" said Mr. Farrakhan, who has long opposed sanctions against Iraq, a predominantly Muslim state.\nIraq's leader, Saddam Hussein, \"is no more terrible\" than Mr. Bush or previous presidents, he added.\n\"If the truth were known, there would be a Nuremberg trial for American presidents,\" Mr. Farrakhan said. \"I cannot allow them to use the American soldier, black, brown and poor white, to fight a war that is unjust and wrong.\"\nMr. Farrakhan's speech, lasting two and a half hours, was at the annual Saviour's Day convention, observing the birthday of Elijah Muhammad, the longtime Nation of Islam leader who died in 1975. The convention was the first held outside Chicago, the sect's headquarters. \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: February 19, 2002"
