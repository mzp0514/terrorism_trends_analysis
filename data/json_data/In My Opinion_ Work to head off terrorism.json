Although the Russian prime minister says. \"We are entering the 21st century. We have to enter it as friends,\" both he and his country's attitude towards nuclear disarmament are decidedly cool.\nJournal\nEven as Stephashin agreed to further negotiations, his country has yet to ratify the 1993 START II accord. This treaty that agreed to cut our arsenals to a max of 3,500 warheads by 2003 and was ratified by our U.S. Senate. The Russian Parliament has yet to put it to a vote of ratification.\nThe Russian parliament should ratify the 1993 START II accord. Further negotiations regarding future disarmament are moot if they and we do not live up to our agreements. The fewer nuclear weapons in this world, the better off everyone will be.\nAs citizens of the reigning superpower, we must become more aware of the awesome and destructive power that nuclear war represents. In such a war, we literally could destroy our world. Terrorists using death as a means to an end are a particular threat.\nBefore the United States and Russia lose sight of the \"trust\" that we are building between our countries, we should use our combined forces to control the loose cannons of this world. Stop the terrorists and other maniacs before they start something that we --- the United States and Russia --- can't stop. We should utilize our trust, knowing that we know better than to start a war, by working together to stop terroristic agendas.\nLAUREN MORRIS, Marietta\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPhoto\nLauren Morris, 17, a Marietta native, is a senior at Pope High School.
