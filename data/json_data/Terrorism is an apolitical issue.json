    "full text": "After a gunman attacked a Colorado Planned Parenthood clinic, leaving three people dead and nine injured. Every single Republican presidential candidate remained silent until Sen. \nTed Cruz, R-Texas, became the first to express his condolences. His response came more than 19 hours after the attack. The leading Democratic candidates acknowledged the attack about half a day before Cruz. Meanwhile, Republican candidates' Twitter feeds advertised Black Friday sales and discussed the polls. Planned Parenthood expressed regrets that \"extremists are creating a poisonous environment that feeds domestic terrorism.\" In response, Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., complained he expected an apology from Planned Parenthood's director, saying there was no evidence the shooter had specifically targeted the organization. Nevertheless, the suspected gunman has since expressed anti-abortion sentiments, mumbling \"no more baby parts\" while speaking with investigators. This apparently alludes to some heavily edited videos released earlier this year which seem to show Planned Parenthood's medical director discussing the sale of fetal tissue. The FBI has reported increased violence against abortion providers since the videos' release - hence, regardless of the motives behind the Colorado attack it is clear that anti-abortion rhetoric has gone too far in this country. We support Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper's call to \"tone down the rhetoric\" regarding abortion. The rhetoric has fueled hatred not intelligent discussion, and now it has politicized a terroristic attack on American soil. Regardless of their feelings about abortion, Republicans and Democrats alike should have the decency to come together and support the victims of this attack.\n\nLoad-Date: November 30, 2015"
