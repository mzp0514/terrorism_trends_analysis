All copies must be destroyed upon completion.\"\n\"While the information is not classified and from public sources, the analysis of it was compromised more by publication in the Daily News than by being inadvertently discarded,\" said Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\"Sensitive\" terrorism analysis page found outside S.I. precinct.\n\nLoad-Date: October 17, 2008"
