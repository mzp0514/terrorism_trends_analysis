The money is allocated to help communities prepare for what's called a complex, coordinated terrorist attack, similar to those that have taken lives in Boston, San Bernardino, Paris and other global cities.\n\"This grant provides us with a tremendous opportunity to enhance the safety of the entire region by developing a system to identify gaps, educate, train, analyze and implement changes to prepare our area, to first prevent, and, if needed, respond to a terrorist attack,\" Naperville Emergency Management Coordinator Dan Nelson said in a news release.\nNaperville and Aurora police and firefighters already use the same digital radio system to communicate, and the cities have cooperated in the past on Homeland Security training.\nThis grant takes the safety collaboration a step further by allowing the municipalities to jointly pursue a three-year plan to improve readiness for a terrorist strike. Goals in the plan include reviewing critical infrastructure, developing continuity-of-operations plans for all agencies and levels of government that would respond to a terrorist attack and adopting common response tactics for first responders across the region.\nThe cities plan to share all terrorism response processes they approve with local, regional, state and national partners.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nCourtesy of city of Aurora Officials from Aurora and Naperville participate in a Homeland Security training session.
