He said President Bush should consider sending more troops to Afghanistan to stabilize the region.\nIn his new ad, which invokes national unity with images of firefighters at Ground Zero, Marines on Iwo Jima and a space shuttle lifting off, a determined Giuliani says, \"When you try and come here and kill our people, we're one and we're going to stand up to you and we're going to prevail.\"\nAt an Elks lodge in Iowa, McCain challenged Giuliani's claims that 9/11 qualified him to direct U.S. foreign policy.\n\"I think he did a great job post-9/11,\" said McCain. But he insisted Giuliani's performance after the terror attacks was not \"the credential to address national security issues. It has very little to do with national security issues.\n\"As far as I know, Mayor Giuliani's never been to Iraq,\" McCain said in a criticism he has leveled at other GOP candidates. \"I'm not saying he is without credentials. I'm saying I'm the one with the most credentials and the most experience and the most judgment.\"\nMcCain said he'd \"hate for a tragedy like this one to affect anybody's campaign,\" but noted his campaign theme has been \"that I'm the one with the experience, the knowledge and the judgment. So perhaps it may serve to enhance those credentials.\"\nckatz@nydailynews.com\n\nLoad-Date: December 28, 2007"
