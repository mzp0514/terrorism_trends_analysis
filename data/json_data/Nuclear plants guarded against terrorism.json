    "full text": "USA TODAY's editorial, \"Homeland insecurity,\" failed to give a complete account of the results of a study conducted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) on the vulnerability of the nation's energy facilities because the editorial grouped commercial nuclear power plants with oil refineries and chemical factories (Feb. 18).\nCSIS said last October that nuclear power plants are \"probably our best-defended\" industrial facilities against a terrorist attack on the critical infrastructure of the United States.\nCSIS came to this conclusion after Silent Vector, a two-day national-security simulation exercise in which nuclear power plants were among a list of seven facilities identified as potential targets for possible attacks by air, ground and sea. CSIS President and Chief Executive Officer John Hamre, a former deputy Defense secretary, said at a news conference that the nuclear industry \"has taken security pretty seriously for a long, long time.\" Hamre also singled out nuclear power plants for their established communications channels with federal, state and local officials.\nIn contrast with other industrial facilities, the nuclear plants that provide electricity to one of every five U.S. homes and businesses are protected by robust steel and concrete structures designed to resist catastrophes and protect the reactor fuel. The plants are further protected by nearly 7,000 expertly trained, well-armed paramilitary security officers who use state-of-the-art electronic surveillance and sensor technology.\nScott Peterson\nVice president\nNuclear Energy Institute\nWashington\n\nLoad-Date: March 5, 2003"
