We are doing all our best.\"\nDuring an hour-long meeting, Christopher reported on his efforts to persuade other governments to fulfill their pledges to contribute tens of millions of dollars and to outline new U.S. aid to the fledgling Palestinian Authority.\nThe aid includes 200 surplus trucks and the dispatch of teams from the Pentagon and the Agriculture Department for advice on medical, humanitarian and agricultural needs.\nBefore the meeting, Christopher praised Israel and the PLO for setting a July 1 target date for finalizing an agreement to withdraw Israeli troops from the West Bank and hold Palestinian elections.\nHe received a detailed report about the agreement from Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and said it injects \"a new burst of energy\" into the peace process.\n\"There is a sense of revitalization across the entire peace process,\" Christopher said outside Peres' office in Jerusalem.\nPeres briefly admonished reporters for a tendency toward skepticism about the agreement he concluded Thursday with Arafat being implemented smoothly.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nThe Associated Press * PLO leader Yasser Arafat escorts U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher after their meeting in Gaza City today.\n\nLoad-Date: March 10, 1995"
