Instability and the cease-fire agreement in Pakistan \"provided al-Qaida leadership with the ability to conduct training and operational planning\" for targets in the United States and Western Europe, he said.\nSpecifically, the report found that attacks in Pakistan rose from 375 to 887 between 2006 and 2007, and the number of fatalities jumped by almost 300 percent from 335 to 1,335.\nIn Afghanistan, the number of attacks rose 16 percent, to 1,127 incidents last year, killing 1,966 people, 55 percent more than the 1,257 who died in 2006, it said.\nMore than 22,000 people were killed by terrorists around the world in 2007, 8 percent more than in 2006, although the overall number of attacks fell, the report said.\nThe grim news in South Asia was tempered by blows against al-Qaida in Iraq, and a steep drop in terrorist attacks and fatalities in Iraq in the second half of 2007, the report said. The White House has attributed that drop to the troop buildup that President Bush ordered last year, a claim some analysts have challenged.\nMr. Dailey also cited successes in breaking up terror plots in Western Europe and progress against terrorist groups in Southeast Asia, Colombia and elsewhere.\nWhile the U.S. government reports such numbers each year, government counterterrorism analysts say they're a poor yardstick for measuring progress against terrorism.\nPakistan, a U.S. ally, was struck by several large-casualty terrorist attacks in its major cities in 2007. And on Dec. 27, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was killed in a suicide bombing in Rawalpindi.\n\nNotes\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nLoad-Date: May 1, 2008"
