    "full text": "Jimmy Carters vision for an Israeli-Palestinian negotiated peace is far removed from the realities on the ground.\nBilateral negotiations are on hold, not because of Israels actions, but because the Palestinians elected a leadership that has done nothing to further Israeli security and refuses to reject terrorism and accept a peaceful path (Israels new plan: A land grab, The Forum, May 16).\nIsraeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has stated that he is giving the Palestinians time to come to the negotiating table themselves, but they must first combat terrorism and guarantee border security, and Hamas itself must repudiate terrorism and recognize Israels right to exist.\nIn the meantime, Israel needs to go forth with policies that will ensure its own security. Thus, Prime Minister Olmert is considering unilateral measures, specifically its retrenchment from the West Bank, which will include the uprooting of Israeli settlements similar to Israels unilateral disengagement from Gaza. Such a move also aims to improve the quality of life for Palestinians  who will be fully governed by Palestinians and have the ability to build up an independent\nstate with limited contact with Israeli civilians and military.\nCarter should abandon his unrealistic call for immediate bilateral negotiations and instead support creative solutions\nthat aim to improve the situation of the combustible realities on the ground.\nAbraham H. Foxman\nNational director\nAnti-Defamation League, New York\nCarters opinion welcome\nFormer president Jimmy Carters criticism of Israels policies is welcome, but hardly goes far enough.\nCarter objects to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmerts move toward unilateral confiscation and colonization of much of\nthe West Bank, policies that would violate the Oslo Accords of 1993 and United Nations resolutions.\nBut Israel has violated Oslo since it was signed, and U.N. resolutions since Israels birth in May 1948.\nMore important than Oslo is Israels systematic violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which governs Israels conduct\nin the Palestinian lands Israel occupied in 1967.\nU.S. and Israeli human rights groups, such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and BTselem, have documented those violations, some of which are war crimes. Among those responsible for such crimes were Prime Ministers Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, both praised by Jimmy Carter.\nAmericans need to know that Israels policies of confiscation and colonization have been going on since 1948 if they are\nto understand Arab and Muslim anger at the USA, and if they are to support a U.S. policy that works for a just peace.\nEdmund R. Hanauer\nExecutive director\nSearch for Justice and Equality in Palestine/Israel\nFramingham, Mass.\n\nLoad-Date: May 23, 2006"
