    "full text": "Timothy McVeigh was put to death Monday morning for the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995. This was an act of terrorism that if foreseen by authorities may not have taken the lives of 168 men, women and children.\nKathryn Lucchese, a cultural geographer who was recently awarded her doctorate from the College of Geosciences at Texas A&M University, has devised a tool that might aid in predicting terrorist activities.\nTexas A&M U.\nLucchese's tool is called the Terror Grid. The Terror Grid is a \"three-dimensional matrix based on site, situation and time,\" she said.\nEach of these factors has two parts. The two parts of \"site\" are common place and cultural monument. If a common place is attacked and people are killed, people will be morally outraged. If a cultural monument is assaulted, but few people were harmed, then people will feel a great cultural loss.\n\"Time\" indicates whether the area that was attacked was crowded or if it was deserted. Obviously, the more people present at an attack site, the higher the number of casualties and fatalities.\nFinally, \"situation\" describes the accessibility of the area. If the site is very difficult to approach, then the attacker would be called \"suicidal.\" If the area is wide open and easy to reach, then the attack would be described as \"cowardly.\"\nTerrorism may be seen as a form of communicating one's thoughts or beliefs. Jonathan Smith from the Department of Geography said \"these terrorist methods are deplorable and their meaning is often sinister, but terrorism is, at heart, an act of communication.\"\nTimothy McVeigh, for example, was displeased with the actions the government took at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas in 1993 and at Ruby Ridge, Idaho in 1992. He communicated his displeasure through the Oklahoma City bombing.\nLucchese did much of her research though on the Patrimony Bombings in Italy during 1993. The Patrimony Bombings were a series of five car bombs used between May 14 and July 28 where churches and art galleries were the targets in the cities of Rome, Florence and Milan. A total of nine people were killed as a result of the attacks in Florence and Milan.\nWhile no one claimed responsibility for these bombings, Lucchese and Italian analysts agree that it was probably the work of the Mafia.\nAt that time, the Italian government was taking actions which lessened the power of the Mafia in Italy. In retaliation, Lucchese said \"Mafia figures may have been protesting through attacking art museums and churches that held great cultural significance for the Italian people.\"\nUnderstanding the cultural significance of a site that has been attacked tells much of why that target was selected. It also explains the feelings of loss the citizens might have.\nOnce these factors have been understood and implemented in the Terror Grid, it might lead to a prediction as to where the next terrorist strike could happen and what, if anything, could be done to prevent it.\nLucchese finished the Terror Grid only last December, but hopes that the grid will be accepted by government and other agencies as a means to prevent further tragedies resulting from acts of terrorism.\n(C) 2001 The Battalion via U-WIRE\n\nLoad-Date: June 12, 2001"
