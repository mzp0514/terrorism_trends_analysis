    "full text": "THE two airliners that brought down the World Trade Center in New York stunned the nation and the world. The one nation that was the shining light of liberty to the world was clearly vulnerable to attacks by those who would use force and intimidation to get the world to submit to their ways.\nThe 9/11 attack was part of an escalating war on the United States. In 1998, al-Qaida operatives bombed the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. In 2000, terrorists rammed the USS Cole, killing 17 American sailors.\nBut this attack on New York and Washington was, as the Daily Mail headline said, \"Unspeakable horror.\" People leapt from the Twin Towers in desperate attempts to escape the fires and the eventual collapse of those structures.\nTerrorists had declared war on Americans. The inevitability of more attacks was clear.\nThe nation resolved to do everything it could do to prevent that. Never again would such acts of terrorism be treated as merely crimes.\nAmerica met the challenge, ousting the Taliban from power in Afghanistan. Saddam Hussein, who had backed terrorist attacks against Israel, was ousted in Iraq.\nVigilance has so far prevented another attack on the scale of 9/11. But there have been attacks by al-Qaida groups and al-Qaida-inspired groups in Bali, Madrid, London, Mumbia and elsewhere. This is a global war against the West.\nYet over time, Americans have slipped back into their 9/10 mentality, where they felt safe and secure.\nEight years ago, we said we would never forget. Too many of us have.\nThe new Homeland Security secretary, Janet Napolitano, made the ridiculous claim that this is not terrorism but rather man-made disasters. This administration now wants to prosecute those man-made disasters as crimes, rather than acts of war.\nThe United States cannot undeclare a war that has been declared against its citizens. If can only decide not to resist until the list of failed states that harbor hostile regimes grows longer.\n\nLoad-Date: September 11, 2009"
