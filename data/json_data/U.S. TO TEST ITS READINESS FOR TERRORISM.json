    "full text": "In an unprecedented exercise next month, a phalanx of the U.S. government's top officials will engage in a massive field test of the nation's preparedness to respond to a terrorist attack within its borders.\nSometime during 10 still-secret days in May, seven Cabinet leaders will receive a chilling, though mock, alert that unknown terrorists have unleashed chemical or biological weapons simultaneously on two cities -- Denver and Portsmouth, N.H.\nAttorney General Janet Reno; the secretaries of defense, energy, transportation, agriculture, and health and human services; and the head of the Environmental Protection Agency will have to drop whatever they are doing and preside over the federal government's emergency response to such a dreaded mass attack.\nCalled \"Operation TopOff\" -- for \"top officials\" -- the field exercise will involve thousands of participants including the governors of the two states, the National Guard and hundreds of state and local emergency and medical personnel. The directors of the FBI and the Federal Emergency Management Agency also will play a lead role.\nA companion drill, possibly involving a pretend attack involving nuclear weapons, will occur in the Washington, D.C., area.\nUntil the mock weapons of mass destruction attacks are announced, only a handful of organizers will know the nature and dimensions of the planned assault. The type of deadly agent used, where it is released, how many people are felled, who the perpetrators are -- all will remain unknown until the exercise is launched sometime between May 7 to May 29.\n\"The players know very, very little,\" Justice Department spokesman Doug Johnson said.\nColorado Gov. Bill Owens said he is completely in the dark. \"It could be a scenario of anything from Denver's water supplies being poisoned to an airborne particulate being released,\" Owens said. \"We are literally waiting hour by hour for the test.\"\nMindful that real terrorists -- knowing that the government's attention will be focused elsewhere -- might view this as a fine time to stage an actual attack, the agencies are taking special precautions.\n\"We're aware that could occur and we have taken appropriate measures,\" Johnson said.\nAmong the elements to be evaluated in the mock disaster are the time it takes to identify the agent, ability to limit its spread, efforts to treat the wounded without causing further contamination, search for the terrorists, and coordinate the dozens of agencies involved.\nDenver and Portsmouth were chosen as sites of the mock attack because they represent a range of size and preparation. Denver has undergone the training while Portsmouth has not. Officials in each city also were eager to participate in the May drill.\n\nLoad-Date: April 27, 2000"
