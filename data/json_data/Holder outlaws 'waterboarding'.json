    "full text": "WASHINGTON — Attorney General Eric Holder ruled out the use of \"waterboarding\" as an interrogation technique for terrorism suspects Monday, calling it a form of torture that the Obama administration could never condone. \nHolder's declaration underscored President Obama's break with the former Bush administration's anti-terrorist policies, which were condemned around the world by human-rights groups, civil liberties advocates and U.S. allies. \n\"Waterboarding is torture. My Justice Department will not justify it, will not rationalize it and will not condone it,\" Holder, who his heading a review of the treatment of terrorism suspects, said in a speech to the Jewish Council of Public Affairs in Washington. His vow was greeted by applause. \nThe Justice Department sets the legal guidance governing torture standards. Under former President George W. Bush, it was criticized as supporting a policy of cruelty — including the simulated drowning technique known as waterboarding. \n\"Too often over the past decade the fight against terrorism has been viewed as a zero-sum battle with our tradition of civil liberties. Not only is that school of thought misguided, I fear that in actuality it has done us more harm than good,\" Holder said. \n\"We cannot ask other nations to stand by us in the pursuit of justice if we are not viewed as being in pursuit of that ideal ourselves,\" he said. \n\nLoad-Date: March 3, 2009"
