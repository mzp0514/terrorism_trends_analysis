The second bomb exploded about two blocks away.\nThe blasts killed three people and maimed scores of others. A terrorism expert briefed on the investigation told CNN that doctors were \"pulling ball bearings out of people in the emergency room.\"\nThe source told the network that preliminary tests showed no C-4 or other high-grade explosive material was used.\n\"They're most likely improvised,\" Bruce Hoffman, a Georgetown University terrorism expert, said of the bombs.\n\"They were designed to kill people. They weren't designed to bring down buildings.\"\nExplosives expert Jimmie Oxley, who consulted with detectives on the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, said it wouldn't require much explosive material to create such blasts.\n\"A couple of pounds of smokeless powder put into a pipe bomb would do it,\" said Oxley, a professor of chemistry at the University of Rhode Island.\nOxley noted that on Christmas Day 2009, underwear bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab tried to blow up Northwest Airlines Flight 253 over Detroit with just 2.8 ounces of pentaerythritol tetranitrate.\nShe said incendiary devices like the ones used in Boston could be made for $100 with instructions found on YouTube.\nA triggering device could be anything from a simple electronic timer to a cell phone.\nsjacobs@nydailynews.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \nNLVL\n\nLoad-Date: April 16, 2013"
