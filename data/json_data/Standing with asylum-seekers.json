    "full text": "Thank you for the inspiring statement by Church World Service (\"Church World Service stands with asylum-seekers,\" June 22).\nI agree that refugees and immigrants who are fleeing war, violence, terrorism, persecution, drought, famine or extreme poverty must be given asylum and amnesty by all developed nations. And this must be done with the love of Christ - never, never separating children from their families. Such separation is demonic and evil, even very abusive, as Sen. Bob Casey and many church leaders have stated.\nThe more than 2,000 children who have already tragically been separated must be returned to their families fast.\nThank God that Church World Service and other faith based organizations are also working to improve conditions in many developing nations through relief, rehabilitation, long-term self-help development, health care, education and peace projects. Let us give to these fine groups.\nMost refugees and immigrants are hardworking, caring people who have sacrificed and suffered for many long, hard years. They are not criminals, but are people looking for peace, freedom and wholeness.\nPeople of all races, colors, creeds and nationalities are one family loved by God. Let us share God's welcome and service and love equally with all.\nJohn F. Fueller\nMount Wolf, York County\n\nLoad-Date: July 7, 2018"
