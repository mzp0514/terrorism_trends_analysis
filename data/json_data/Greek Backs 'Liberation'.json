    "full text": "Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, who returned today from an official visit to Yugoslavia, said in a speech in Belgrade Wednesday night that a distinction must be made between terrorism and actions of liberation movements.\n''We condemn terrorism as a nonpolitical and uncivilized action,'' Mr. Papandreou said in a toast at a dinner given by the Yugoslav Prime Minister, Milka Planinc.\n''Of course, we always make a difference between terrorism and the struggle of liberation movements.\n''It is a very important difference, and it would be useful if every one in the world made that difference, because each country has the right and duty to struggle for its own independence.''\nThe passage was quoted by Tanyug, the official Yugoslav press agency.\nLess than a month ago in the same city, Secretary of State George P. Shultz clashed publicly with the Yugoslav Foreign Minister, Raif Dizdarevic, when Mr. Disdarevic said that in assessing terrorist acts, ''one must also view the causes that lead to it.''\nLike other European countries who are allies of the United States, Greece was urged by the Reagan Administration to join in economic sanctions against Libya, but Greece rejected participation in sanctions of any kind."
