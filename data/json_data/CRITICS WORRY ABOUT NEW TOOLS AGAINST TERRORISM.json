The legislation would give the government more power to fight terrorism and greater authority to protect the confidentiality of sources in official proceedings.\nClinton also directed the heads of the FBI, the Justice Department and the National Security Council to prepare a memo authorizing \"any and all further steps necessary to combat terrorism,\" presidential aide George Stephanopoulos said.\nJames X. Dempsey, an official of a group specializing in protection of civil liberties, said, \"The FBI already has a very active and very aggressive counterterrorism program. The FBI is awash in information. The problem is sifting through what it already gets.\"\nDempsey is deputy director of Center for National Security Studies., a nonprofit group.\n\nLoad-Date: April 25, 1995"
