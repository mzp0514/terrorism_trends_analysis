    "full text": "This is directed to both Jack Bologna regarding his article \"Trade Muslims for Liberals\" (Sept. 20 and TribLIVE) and to the Trib itself. First, please separate terrorism and the religion of Islam. The two are not synonymous or mutually exclusive.  \nISIS is first and foremost comprised of thugs, many of whom happen to be Muslim. They are not thugs because they are Muslim. Categorizing an entire religion by the actions of a few is small-minded and unfair, and it makes one appear to be a bigoted Islamophobe.  \nAnd the \"condemnation (of ISIS) from other Muslims\" is loud, but one must be willing to listen for it. \nThirty-four Islamic nations formed a coalition against terrorism and are making clear efforts to curb terrorism, which would have been evident to Mr. Bologna had he done any research to back his article. \nImagine if the rest of the world judged Christians by the actions of the Westboro Baptist Church. \nThe suggestion (sarcastic or otherwise) that liberals should be traded for Muslims makes light of a serious crisis and I don't understand why Trib would publish such an insensitive piece. Running sensationalist letters to attract new readers is a betrayal of your current ones. \nMadeline Bordo \nMcCandless \n\nLoad-Date: October 9, 2016"
