Recently, a spokesman refused to commit to Egypt's longstanding peace treaty with the Jewish state.\nWe are \"not against Jews,\" Mohamed Morsy told CNN. \"We are against Zionism.\"\nOn its website, the Brotherhood says it takes a \"middle-of-the-road intellectual line in dealing with various Islamic issues.\" At the same time, it \"seeks to establish Allah's law in the land.\"\nFounded in the 1920s, the Brotherhood battled British colonial rulers and Jews settling in Israel.\nLater, they backed Gamal Abdel Nasser's revolt to free Egypt - but tried to kill him when he balked at forging an Islamic state. Nasser and his successors cracked down hard on the group.\nThe modern Brotherhood pushes a political agenda. One leader said in a 2007 interview that a name change was being considered so that the Western world would not associate it with terrorism.\ncsiemaszko@nydailynews.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \nA boy chants anti-government slogans yesterday as Cairo protesters in Tahrir Square continue calling for the resignation of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
