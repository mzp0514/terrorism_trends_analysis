    "full text": "WASHINGTON-The government last week took another step toward aiding insurers in providing financial relief from future terrorism losses when The House Financial Services Committee approved terrorism insurance legislation by a voice vote.\nThe legislation-H.R. 3210, or the Terrorism Risk Protection Act-would call on the federal government to lend commercial property/casualty insurers money to cover terrorism losses if the industry were to pay out an aggregate $1 billion in terrorism-related claims, with special provisions for smaller insurance companies. Insurers would be required to repay the government loans.\nAlthough the legislation approved by the House panel contains provisions sought by risk managers, it does not meet all of the expectations of policyholders and insurers, which now await the introduction of legislation in the Senate.\nUnder the House proposal, insurers would retain 10% of covered terrorism losses totaling up to $20 billion, with government loans paying for the remaining 90%. If covered losses exceeded $20 billion, commercial insurers could impose a premium surcharge on all commercial policyholders, though the surcharge could not exceed 3% of a policyholder's premium. The proposed loan program would last for one year, though it could be extended by up to two years.\nThe measure could undergo further revision and clarification before it reaches the House floor, which could occur before Congress adjourns for its Thanksgiving recess. No terrorism insurance bill has yet been introduced in the Senate, though leaders of the Senate Banking Committee and the White House last week announced they had reached agreement on the contents of a proposed bill that would provide the industry with catastrophic reinsurance coverage-rather than loans-above $10 billion in industry losses (BI, Nov. 5).\nInsurer trade associations generally prefer the Senate approach, but with a lower attachment point.\nBased on what has been proposed in Congress to date, the National Assn. of Independent Insurers' ideal solution would be the Senate's proposed approach, with an individual company trigger, Jack Ramirez, president of the NAII, said at its annual meeting in New Orleans last week.\nThe Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc. last week released a list of four principles it said need to be incorporated into any federal terrorism insurance legislation. They are:\n* All insurers of U.S. policyholders with domestic and international properties should have access to an industry-driven reinsurance mechanism.\n* ''Acts of terrorism'' and ''acts of war'' need to be clearly defined.\n* Federal support for the insurance industry should be limited to five to six years.\n* Lines of coverage should include business interruption and workers compensation.\nThe House bill was amended from earlier versions to allay the concerns of some self-insured organizations that terrorism insurance legislation would not apply to surety bonds. Surety bonds were omitted from previous versions of the bill but were included in the version approved last week.\nEmployers nationwide rely on surety bonds to meet state mandates that require self-insurers to post security deposits with regulators.\nFailure to make surety bonds eligible for federal protection could have caused the market for these instruments to dry up, making it more difficult for businesses to self-insure, said Theresa Muir, manager of the workers comp division of Southern California Edison Co. in Rosemead, Calif.\nThe House legislation also would aid self-insurers because its passage would help ensure that excess coverage remains available, she said.\nState guaranty funds set up to cover self-insured workers compensation programs typically require self-insurers to purchase excess coverage for their workers comp exposures, Ms. Muir explained.\nMore than 30 states have such guaranty funds. In some states, government agencies oversee them, while in others they are private corporations.\n\nLoad-Date: November 16, 2001"
