Cuba was represented by Vice President Carlos Lage.\nDraft text for the summit's final statement calls the attacks against the United States \"barbarian acts because they are tantamount to an insult to human dignity and a threat to democracy.\"\nWhile the leaders were expected to support the U.S. armed campaign against terrorism, the prepared text also called for such a response be carried out within the rules of the United Nations.\n\"Not everything can be considered acceptable in fighting terrorism,\" Peruvian Foreign Minister Diego Garcia Sayan said.\nUnder discussion was a joint commitment by the leaders to promote legal changes at home aimed at cracking down on terrorists. That includes an agreement to make it easier for nations to extradite suspected terrorists.\nThe leaders were expected to sign off on the statement before the summit concludes.\nToledo earlier made an appeal to his peers to \"give a hand\" to financially troubled Argentina, which is struggling to recover from a lengthy recession that has aggravated a heavy debt burden.\nThe Peruvian leader warned that support for Argentina was necessary not only as a sign of solidarity but also because the crisis could hurt the economies across the region.\nRegional leaders have warned that economic instability may also threaten democratic rule.\nThe summit's draft also included an appeal to developed nations and banks to allow \"a more flexible treatment\" of poor countries' debts.\n\nLoad-Date: November 24, 2001"
