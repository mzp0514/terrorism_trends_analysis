    "full text": "The editorial ''Confidence in the CIA,'' Nov. 3: observes\naccurately that with the end of the cold war the complexity of\ninternational relations and security requires intelligence services\nin which the American people have confidence. These intelligence\nservices must also possess competence.\nThe challenge of a diverse, expanding array of national security\nissues - nuclear proliferation, international terrorism, economic\nespionage, and ethnic conflict, among others - has begun to strain\nthe capabilities of the ossified bureaucracies of US intelligence.\nWithout a complete restructuring of intelligence services\ndesigned to address the proliferation of these new challenges to\nglobal security, the US will be ill prepared to help ensure\nstability and peace in the 21st century.\nIt is urgent for Congress to review and revise the National\nSecurity Act of 1947 and to create an innovative, effective\norganizational structure for our intelligence services.\nW.F. Dunkelberger, Randolph, Vt.\n \n Your letters are welcome. For publication they must be signed\nand include your address and telephone number.
