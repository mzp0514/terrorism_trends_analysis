It added that road travel should be ''undertaken only during daylight hours'' and be confined to main roads.\nAll visitors to Nicaragua are strongly urged by the department to make contact with the American Embassy in Managua. The advisory also notes that upon arrival, travelers are subject to ''military searches.''\nOn Nicaragua the department adds, ''Mariners are advised to avoid the Caribbean ports and waters of Nicaragua until further notice.'' On El Salvador the department says ''acts of terrorism have generally not been directed against foreigners during the past year,'' but cautions against ''traveling by land outside of urban areas,'' since ''many roads are subject to terrorist interdiction.'' It specifically cautions against any travel in the northeastern portion of El Salvador since it is ''considered to be ''very dangerous''.\nThere has been no advisory issued about travel by Americans in Honduras."
