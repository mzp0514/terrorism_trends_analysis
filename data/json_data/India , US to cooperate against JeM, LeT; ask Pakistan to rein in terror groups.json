A lot of the discussions also related to what was happening in Afghanistan,\" he said.\nResolving to fight together against this grave challenge to humanity, the two leaders announced increased cooperation \"to prevent terrorist travel and to disrupt global recruitment efforts by expanding intelligence-sharing and operational- level counter-terrorism cooperation.\"\nThe statement said that the two leaders committed to strengthen cooperation against terror threats from groups including Al-Qaeda, ISIS, Jaish-e-Mohammad, Lashkar-e-Taiba, D-Company and their affiliates.\nThe two leaders recognised that terrorism is a \"global scourge\" which must be fought and terrorist safe havens rooted out in every part of the world.\nJaishankar said the designation of Hizbul Mujahideen leader Syed Salahuddin by the US as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist \"is a strong signal coming out of the administration that it is committed to ending terror in all forms.\"\n\"We should take the step for what it is. It is fixing responsibility, highlighting the problem. There is a signalling out of it, it is focusing on a particular group and particular individual. None of us can really miss that message,\" he said.\nThe two sides also agreed to have a new consultation mechanism on domestic and international terrorist designations and listing proposals.\nModi and Trump welcomed the exchange of information on known and suspected terrorists for travel screening.\n\"They further resolved to strengthen information exchange on plans, movements and linkages of terrorist groups and their leaders, as well as on raising and moving of funds by terrorist groups,\" the statement said.\nThe leaders affirmed their support for a UN Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism that will advance and strengthen the framework for global collaboration and reinforce the message that no cause or grievance justifies terrorism.\n\"They also pledged to work together to prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems and to deny access to such weapons by terrorists and non-state actors,\" the statement said.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MetroVaartha English.
