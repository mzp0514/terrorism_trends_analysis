    "full text": "The likely nomination of John McCain signals the end of the conservative tradition (\"John McCain for president: A hero leader,\" Editorial, Feb. 10 and PghTrib.com). \nInstead, voters will cast ballots for a moderate at best, who opposed the Bush tax cuts, supported amnesty for illegal aliens, restricted free speech in campaigns and favors global warming regulations. \nPat Buchanan says, \"McCain will make Cheney look like Gandhi.\" McCain has an itchy trigger finger, has an unwillingness to negotiate as Reagan did and seems quite ready to fight Iran. \nIt baffles me as to how Iran, a country with no nuclear capabilities, could destroy Israel, a country with more than 200 nuclear weapons and the world's best-trained military. \nWhat happened to the conservative principles of low taxes, rule of law, speech not regulated by \"fairness\" and minding our own business abroad? \nWasn't interventionism the policy of Woodrow Wilson and Bill Clinton? What have we gained from war with a country that had nothing to do with 9/11 in the first place? This is not a conservative war; it is costly and does not make us safer. \nThe candidate (Texas Congressman Ron Paul) who has actually addressed the root of terrorism and been endorsed by the former head of the CIA's bin Laden unit is languishing in the polls and mocked, while the candidate who knows the least about terrorism and conservatism is now the darling of the Republican Party. \nMcCain pledges to cut taxes, while not addressing the economic costs of an empire that aggravates people around the world. This is expected: McCain admits the economy is not his strong point. What is? \nThanks, Trib! \nNathaniel Snider \nLatrobe \n\nLoad-Date: February 12, 2008"
