Sanli, 40, was armed with enough TNT to blow up a two-story building and also detonated a hand grenade, officials said.\nTurkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday that police believe the bomber was connected to his nation's outlawed leftist militant group Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, or DHKP-C. And on Saturday DHKP-C claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement posted on a website linked to the group. It said Sanli had carried out the act of \"self-sacrifice\" on behalf of the group.\nThe group called itself \"immortal\" and said, \"Down with imperialism and the collaborating oligarchy.\" But it gave no reason for attacking the U.S. Embassy.\nMeanwhile, Turkey's private NTV television said police detained three people on Saturday who may be connected to the U.S. Embassy attack. Two of the suspects were being questioned by police in Ankara, while the third was arrested in Istanbul and was being brought to Ankara.\nNTV, citing unidentified security sources, said one of the suspects is a man whose identity Sanli allegedly used to enter Turkey illegally, while the second was suspected of forging identity papers. There was no information about the third suspect.\nEarlier, Turkish Interior Minister Muammer Guler said Sanli had fled from Turkey after he was released from jail in 2001, but managed to return to the country \"illegally,\" using a fake ID. It was not clear how long before the attack he had returned to Turkey.\nNTV said he is believed to have come to Turkey from Germany, crossing into Turkey from Greece. Police officials in Ankara could not immediately be reached for comment.\nDHKP-C has claimed responsibility for assassinations and bombings since the 1970s, but it has been relatively quiet in recent years. Compared with al-Qaida, it has not been seen as a strong terrorist threat.\nSanli's motives remained unclear. Some Turkish government officials have linked the attack to the arrest last month of dozens of suspected members of the DHKP-C group in a nationwide sweep. Speculation also has abounded that the bombing was related to the perceived support of the U.S. for Turkey's harsh criticism of the regime in Syria, whose civil war has forced tens of thousands of Syrians to seek shelter in Turkey. Prime Minister Erdogan has denied that.\nOfficials said Sanli was arrested in 1997 for alleged involvement in attacks on Istanbul's police headquarters and a military guesthouse, and jailed on charges of membership in the DHKP-C group.\nWhile in prison awaiting trial, he took part in a major hunger strike that led to the deaths of dozens of inmates, according to a statement from the Ankara governor's office. The protesters opposed a maximum-security system in which prisoners were held in small cells instead of large wards.\nNYC WOMAN FOUND DEAD\nA woman from New York City who went missing while vacationing alone in Istanbul was found dead on Saturday, and police detained nine people for questioning in connection with the case, Turkey's state-run news agency said.\nSarai Sierra, 33, a mother of two, was last heard from on Jan. 21, the day she was to fly home. Her disappearance attracted interest in Turkey, and Istanbul police had set up a special unit to find her.\nThe state-run Anadolu Agency said that the body of a woman was discovered Saturday evening near the remnants of ancient city walls and that police later identified it as Sierra's.\nThe agency did not say what caused her death. But NTV television reported that she was stabbed to death, while a private news agency, Dogan, said she had a head wound, suggesting she may have been hit with an object.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n Photo by ASSOCIATED PRESS U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Francis J.
