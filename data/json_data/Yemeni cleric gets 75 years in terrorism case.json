    "full text": "A Yemeni cleric who bragged about his ties to Osama bin Laden was sentenced Thursday to 75 years in prison in a terrorism financing case that was nearly derailed when the government's star witness set himself on fire outside the White House.\nA federal judge prefaced Sheik Mohammed Ali Hassan al-Moayad's sentence with a recitation of the events of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\"While the defendant is not being sentenced as a result of the events of 9/11, he came to the attention of the authorities because of 9/11,\" U.S. District Judge Sterling Johnson Jr. said.\nA jury in March found al-Moayad, 57, guilty of conspiring to support and trying to support al-Qaida and the Palestinian extremist group Hamas. He also was convicted of supporting Hamas but acquitted of supporting al-Qaida.\nTwo FBI informers lured al-Moayad to Germany in 2003. He was secretly recorded promising to funnel money to Hamas and al-Qaida. He also boasted that bin Laden called him \"my sheik.\" He was arrested and sent to the U.S.\nOne of the informers, Mohamed Alanssi, set himself on fire in Washington in November in what he later described as an attempt to get more money from the FBI, which paid him at least $100,000. \nAlanssi recovered in time for the trial and described al-Moayad as a dedicated funder of terrorism.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO\n PHOTO - Sheik Mohammed Ali Hassan al-Moayad was found guilty in March. \n\nLoad-Date: July 30, 2005"
