    "full text": "WASHINGTON — Four weeks before the election, Republicans used a politically charged House hearing to confront State Department officials about security at the U.S. Consulate in Libya and assail the Obama administration's early response to the killing of the ambassador and three other Americans there.\nGOP lawmakers refused to accept the department's explanation Wednesday that protection judged adequate for the threat was overwhelmed by an unprecedented assault in Benghazi on the 11th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks.\nThey also rejected Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy's explanation that officials were relying on the best intelligence available in characterizing the attack afterward as stemming from a protest over an anti-Islam Internet video rather than a deliberate, planned act of terrorism.\nA top State official acknowledged she had declined to approve more U.S. security as violence in Benghazi spiked, saying the department wanted to train Libyans to protect the consulate.\n\"I made the best decisions I could with the information I had,\" said Charlene R. Lamb, a deputy assistant secretary for diplomatic security.\nRegardless of allegations of blame, there is no dispute over the tragic result. U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans — including two former Navy SEALs — were killed in what administration officials now describe as an act of terrorism.\nDemocrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee tried to blame Republicans for cutting more than $300 million in diplomatic security funds worldwide.\nRep. Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican, asked Lamb if she turned down requests for more security in Benghazi.\n\"Yes sir, I said personally I would not support it,\" she replied. \"We were training local Libyans and army men\" to provide security, a policy in force at U.S. diplomatic facilities around the world.\nEric Nordstrom, who was the top security official in Libya earlier this year, testified he was criticized for seeking more security. \"There was no plan and it was hoped it would get better,\" he said.\nLt. Col. Andrew Wood, who headed a 16-member military force in Libya, disputed State Department officials who said the special operations troops were replaced by people with the same skill sets.\nThe skills of his troops were \"way above the skill level of local (forces) armed with a pistol,\" Wood said.\n, adding he was he was frustrated that pleas for more security were not met.\n\"We were fighting a losing battle, we weren't even allowed to keep what we had,\" he testified.\nNordstrom acknowledged in response to a question from Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, that while the State Department was refusing more security, his and others' pay was increased because he was serving in such a dangerous area.\n\nLoad-Date: October 11, 2012"
