    "full text": "Legislators joined military officials Thursday in a press conference at the state Capitol to promote \"Vets for Victory,\" a program started in December to send a message of support for the troops fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. Retired Lt. \nCol. Steve Russell said he organized the effort in Oklahoma to send a clear message to the troops that the people in Oklahoma were behind them in their effort to combat terrorism. He said it was important to change public sentiment at a time when polls indicate waning support for U.S. military involvement in Iraq. A concurrent resolution was approved by the state Senate and state House this week showing support for troops. State Sen. Tom Ivester, D-Sayre, a combat veteran who served in Afghanistan, said it was important that troops understood clearly how much support they had back home. \"We will not abandon no matter what course this nation takes,\" Ivester said of the message. State Rep. Paul Wesselhoft, R-Moore, said it was important to recognize the efforts of the troops in putting their lives on the line against terrorism. \"What we don't want to see is what happened during the Vietnam War era,\" Wesselhoft said. The first Victory Rally will be held Saturday on the south steps of the state Capitol as the first of many anticipated events nationwide. Russell said the hour-long event is expected to include speakers, music, and a reading of the resolution.\n\nLoad-Date: February 16, 2007"
