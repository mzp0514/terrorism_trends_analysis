    "full text": "WASHINGTON â€” The Justice Department said Thursday that it has seized millions of dollars from cryptocurrency accounts that militant groups, including al-Qaida and the Islamic State, relied on to finance their organizations and violent plots. Law enforcement officials said the groups used the accounts to solicit donations, including by trying to raise money from the sale of fraudulent personal protective equipment for the coronavirus pandemic. Officials described it as the largest-ever seizure of virtual currency funds related to terrorism. It's also part of a broader Justice Department goal of disrupting the financing of extremist organizations. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are favored for illicit transactions because they are perceived as hard to trace, and one of the groups singled out Thursday explicitly encouraged donations by telling potential contributors that the money trail would be difficult for law enforcement to untangle, the department said. The legal action, which included undercover law enforcement work and a forfeiture complaint filed in federal court, is meant to deprive the organizations of funds needed to buy weapons and training, Assistant Attorney General John Demers said.\n\nNotes\n\nEds: UPDATES: Updates with more details; adds missing letter \"s\" in first paragraph to word \"organizations\" Eds: UPDATES: Adds missing comma in fifth paragraph.\n\nLoad-Date: August 14, 2020"
