Martin Sabo, D-Minn., and Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D. \"Together, we need to build greater tolerance, the only moral response to a spiral of violence and hatred that threatens humanity itself,\" Bondevik said.\n   Elie Wiesel, a Holocaust survivor and 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner, will be co-chairman of the summit.\n   The Norwegian prime minister spoke of his country's commitment to the U.S. war in Afghanistan, saying Norway has offered fighter aircraft, transport helicopters and specialists in winter operations.\n   Minnesota House members at the luncheon commended Bondevik for his plans for a summit.\n   \"Norway is once again, as it does in many initiatives, taking a leadership role in peace,\" said Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum.\n   Sabo also lauded the goals of the summit and said that Minnesota and Norway continue to have a special relationship that began with Scandinavians, including his parents, who immigrated to Minnesota in large numbers in the early 1900s.\n    _ Sarah McKenzie is at smckenzie@mcclatchydc.com.  \n\nLoad-Date: December 5, 2001"
