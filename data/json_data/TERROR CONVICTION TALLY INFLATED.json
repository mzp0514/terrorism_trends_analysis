    "full text": "The Justice Department reported inflated numbers of terrorism convictions as a result of misinformation from U.S. attorney's offices around the country, the General Accounting Office has found.\n The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, found that the number of terrorism convictions reported in 2002 was inflated by 46 percent because of inaccurate and unreliable information from U.S. attorneys.\nAt least 132 of 288 cases the GAO examined were misclassified as terrorism-related, the agency told Congress.\n The numbers are an important tool for Justice and Congress in assessing the performance of law enforcement in pursuing terrorism cases.\n \"We found that DOJ does not have sufficient management oversight and internal controls in place â€¦ to ensure the accuracy and reliability of its terrorism-related conviction statistics,\" the GAO concluded.\n The Justice Department said it agreed with the GAO's findings and plans stronger oversight of terrorism conviction data sent to Washington.\n The GAO examined the conviction numbers after the Philadelphia Inquirer accused the DOJ of inflating them in its fiscal year 2000 performance review.\n At the time, the Justice Department used conviction numbers supplied by the FBI, which included international and local statistics as well as federal convictions.\n As a result of the criticism, the Justice Department in 2001 began using numbers supplied by U.S. attorney's offices.\n\nNotes\n\nTHE ROAD TO WAR\n\nLoad-Date: February 25, 2003"
