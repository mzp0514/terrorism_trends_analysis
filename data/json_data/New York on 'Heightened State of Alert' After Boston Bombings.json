We have 1,000 members of the NYPD assigned to counter-terrorism duties, and they - along with the entire NYPD and the investments we have made in counter-terrorism infrastructure - are being fully mobilized to protect our city.\"\nGovernor Andrew Cuomo issued his own statement announcing that all state agencies are on \"a heightened state of alert as we learn more about this incident,\" the facts of which are still emerging.\n\"I have directed state agencies, including the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services, State Police, the MTA and the Port Authority, to be on a heightened state of alert as we learn more about this incident,\" Mr. Cuomo said.\n(Photo: Anna Silman)\n\"New York National Guard on Sunday sent three vehicles and 6 soldiers to support the Marathon, and they are on hand to assist with emergency response and work together with local authorities following this incident.\"\nSeveral other cities, including Washington D.C., have begun taking similar steps to secure landmarks and high-trafficked areas.\nIn Times Square, bystanders were frightened by the news and the heightened police presence.\nKirsten Andrews and Lauren Adamo, visitors from Maine, had been following the news for the past hour in their hotel room and came out to observe the scene in the square.\n\"I wanted to come down and talk to a cop and see if they have a plan in motion if anything happened right now, because it would be chaotic,\" said Ms. Andrews. \"I'm wondering why subways and buses are still running.\"\nMs. Adamo was concerned about the possibility of more explosions. \"My stepdad's in the military and he says all big cities are under threat right now,\" said Ms. Adamo. \"It's a little unsettling.\"\n\nLoad-Date: April 15, 2013"
