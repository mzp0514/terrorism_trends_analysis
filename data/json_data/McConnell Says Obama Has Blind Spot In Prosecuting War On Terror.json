And, thankfully, Gitmo is still open for business. But this was a dangerous precedent to set.\"\nHe also criticized the administration&apos;s decision to end the CIA&apos;s enhanced interrogation program, saying, \"Rather than looking closely at the implications of shuttering this vital program, the administration simply ended it, without even getting final sign-off from the CIA.\"\n\"The bottom line is this,\" McConnell said in closing, \"Treating terrorism as a law enforcement matter is precisely the attitude that kept us from seeing this threat when we should have. Reverting to it now is not only dangerous, it&apos;s potentially disastrous.\"\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\nCopyright(c) 2010 RTTNews.com, Inc.
