    "full text": "The statement\n\"For four days in Denver, the Democrats were afraid to use the words 'Islamic terrorism.'\"\nRudy Giuliani, Sept. 3 at the Republican National Convention\nThe ruling\nWe won't go so far as to examine the state of the Democrats' emotions - whether they were in fact \"afraid\" - during their quadrennial conclave, but we have reviewed the 179 speeches delivered there to see how often the Democrats discussed terrorism, and it's clear Giuliani is on shaky ground. Indeed, the word ''Islamic'' was never mentioned by the Democrats, but they spent plenty of time discussing \"terrorism.\" Some form of the word was mentioned at least 37 times, and by some of the most prominent speakers, including Barack Obama himself, vice presidential nominee Joe Biden, former President Bill Clinton and New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton. Nevada delegate Xiomara Rodriguez even brought it up saying Obama had exercised sound judgment \"to oppose the Iraq war from the start and is determined to end the war and bring our troops home and win the fight against the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11.\" Giuliani is technically correct that Democrats never used the words ''Islamic terrorism,'' but they discussed terrorism plenty.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO (2)\n\nLoad-Date: September 10, 2008"
