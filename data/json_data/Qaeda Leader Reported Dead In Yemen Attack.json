    "full text": "SANA, Yemen -- A drone fired on a group of people preparing to attack Yemeni troops on Thursday, killing at least nine, including a man identified as a leader of the local branch of Al Qaeda, according to Yemeni and security officials, who said the aircraft was American-operated.\nThe strike took place less than a mile from a Yemeni brigade's position in the southern province of Abyan, the officials said, adding that troops from the brigade found and defused an explosive belt that was wrapped around the waist of one of the dead, identified as Nader al-Shaddadi, one of the top leaders of Al Qaeda in the region.\nThe officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters.\nResidents said that they had identified four other bodies but that the remaining four dead were not known to them.\nThe use of drones to mount attacks in Yemen has been contentious, with critics and some American government officials saying that the strikes cause civilian casualties that can fuel anti-American sentiment.\nAmerican military strikes in Yemen started in late 2009. They were directed at terrorism suspects, particularly members of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the network's branch in Yemen.\nThe drone attacks were suspended here in May 2010, partly because of concerns about civilian deaths, including the killing of a Yemeni deputy provincial governor.\nBut President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi endorsed the drone strike program last month during a visit to Washington, saying Yemen's Air Force could not mount attacks at night and praising the drones' accuracy as ''unmatched by the human brain.''\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/world/middleeast/yemen-drone-strike-al-qaeda.html\n\nLoad-Date: October 19, 2012"
