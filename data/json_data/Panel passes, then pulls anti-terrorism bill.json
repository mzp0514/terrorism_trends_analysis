It was meant to address a recent spate of anthrax scares, which have been inspired by the real anthrax attacks in places like New York and at the Pentagon, Public Safety Secretary Joe Martin said.\nMartin said the hoaxes waste resources needed for real responses and shake public confidence.\n\"It truly is disheartening and unfortunate,\" Martin said.\nThe bill that the Judiciary Committee passed dealt not only with the hoaxes, but with the real events-terrorist attacks involving things like biological or nuclear weapons.\nThe bill should not do both, Amores said.\n\"The intent was specifically to address the huge number of hoaxes that are going on statewide,\" he said.\nFederal law already sets penalties for terrorist acts, Amores said. He said the law is \"unclear, even toothless\" when it comes to hoax terrorist attacks and those are what are really hurting emergency workers.\nAmores said the confusion came in part because the bill \"came from the governor's office in a broader sense.\"\nWise's general counsel, Alex Macia, said the administration's bill had targeted, in addition to hoaxes, real attacks. \"Judiciary has found many other laws that already deal with that,\" he said.\nWriter Sam Tranum can be reached at 348-4872 or by e-mail at samt@dailymail.com.  \n-30\n\nLoad-Date: October 25, 2001"
