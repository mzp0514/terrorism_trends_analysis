Mr. Mubarak extended it for a third year over opposition complaints that the law was too harsh.\nPresident Hosni Mubarak of Egypt defends extension of emergency-powers law which gives sweeping detention powers to Government; it was imposed after assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat in 1981 (S)\n''The emergency law is used against terrorism,'' he said in a nationally televised speech at the opening of Parliament. Looking at opposition lawmakers, he said: ''So why are you afraid? Are you planning on becoming terrorists?''\nWhen some opposition figures protested, Mubarak departed from his prepared text and said: ''I don't mean to insult anyone in person. We are patient as long as the criticism is constructive and does not reach the level of anarchy, and as long as it does not affect the people's interests.''\nPresident Mubarak is the head of the governing National Democratic Party. His criticism was aimed at the most outspoken opposition, the Labor Party, the Liberal Party and the National Progressive Unionists, whose newspapers have harshly attacked Mr. Mubarak and the Government.\nThe Liberal and Labor parties hold 12 seats in the 392-seat assembly. The Unionist Party has no representation."
