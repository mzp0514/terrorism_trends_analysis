    "full text": "The death early today of a town councilman who had been kidnapped and fatally wounded by Basque separatists touched off new protests against terrorism throughout Spain, with tension rising particularly in the Basque city of Pamplona, where riot policemen struggled to control the angry crowds.\nThe councilman, Miguel Angel Blanco, 29, was kidnapped on Thursday and found shot with two bullets to the head on Saturday near the city of San Sebastian in northern Spain. He died there before dawn today, in the hospital of Our Lady of Aranzazu.\nThousands of Spaniards took their protests to the streets in various cities for the fourth consecutive day, shouting that they had had enough of terrorism and calling the Basque separatists assassins. Pope John Paul II and the French Government condemned the killing today.\nIn Pamplona, city officials canceled the running of the bulls today, the first cancellation in 19 years at the weeklong annual bullfight fiesta. More than 1,000 people crowded onto the streets of the old quarter anyway to run silently as a protest against the Basque rebels, who seek an independent homeland.\nBut they were soon taunted by about 50 supporters of the Popular Unity party, which is linked to the Basque separatist group E.T.A., whose initials stand for Basque Homeland and Freedom in the Basque language. Scuffles ensued and the police fired tear gas and rubber bullets, arresting at least one person, while 18 people reportedly suffered minor injuries.\nInterior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja said Popular Unity was an \"accomplice\" in the killing of the councilman. But he appealed for calm and urged Spaniards to keep their protests within the law.\nE.T.A. had claimed responsibility for kidnapping Mr. Blanco and threatened to execute him on Saturday if some 500 jailed Basque separatists were not transferred to prisons closer to their families in the northern Basque region.\nBut the Government refused to alter its policy of dispersing rebel prisoners to jails across Spain as a way to prevent them from communicating effectively while behind bars.\nPrime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said in an interview published today in the regional daily, La Voz de Galicia, that \"with E.T.A., there is nothing to negotiate.\"\nThe Prime Minister's office announced that he would attend the funeral of Mr. Blanco on Monday in his home village of Ermua in northern Spain. The councilman was a member of Mr. Aznar's governing conservative Popular Party.\nLeaders representing all of the political parties that hold seats in the Basque regional parliament except the one linked to E.T.A. held an emergency meeting today and released a statement saying, \"E.T.A. is weaker and more alone today than yesterday. But the society is more united than ever\" in its stand against terrorism.\nNational political leaders picked up the same theme, but similar statements of unity after past attacks by Basque rebels have often given way to divisions among the parties which stand against terrorism.\nTwo weeks ago, after the national police made a spectacular rescue of a prison guard whom E.T.A. had held hostage for 17 months, some Basque politicians grumbled that their own Basque regional police were not allowed to assist the national police in the operation.\nBut the wave of protests against terrorism in the past months has been the most sustained in memory, at first pressing for the release of the prison guard and a kidnapped Basque businessman -- who was freed after his family reportedly paid a ransom to E.T.A. -- and then this week on behalf of the town councilman.\nA nonprofit group in Bilbao, Gesture for Peace, is credited with introducing in 1993 the use of blue bows as a symbol against terrorism. Thousands of Spaniards have since adopted it, pinning little blue bows to their clothing during kidnappings.\nBut in Ermua, the councilman's hometown, the villagers today changed the color of the bow to black.\nE.T.A. has killed nearly 800 people and wounded thousands more in a campaign of car bombings, shootings and other attacks since 1968.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPhoto: After the death of Miguel Angel Blanco on Sunday at the hands of rebels, his fiancee and his sister embraced in consolation as his grieving parents looked on.
