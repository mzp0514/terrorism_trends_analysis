The motive for his rampage remains unclear.\nSounds like onset of schizophrenia that was missed when he came back from deployment. Instead of identifying the shooter as someone who was having breaks from reality and getting him help, they should start treating him like a criminal. He probably was \"fine\" when he got on the plane and had another episode en route. Being confused, he lashed out with this atrocious act.\nNate Walton\nIf you label a veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder a \"terrorist,\" will you label all veterans with PTSD as \"potential terrorists\"?\nThe problem lies with the government failing to adequately care for the mental health needs of its veterans. If you have the motivation and money to wage wars on foreign nations, you should damn well be able to find the money to treat those servicemembers when they return.\nAngela Taylor\nTerrorism? Hah! The guy was mentally ill with little to no access to care and easy access to firearms.\nJoe Tuscano\nRidiculous! This person clearly has a history of mental health. The motive was not terrorism, folks.\nJames Floyd\nWhen a man starts shooting people in the head in an airport, that is terrorism. Be it Islamic terror or domestic terror, it is terror nonetheless.\nJeff Weber\nIt's too early to say PTSD. Let's wait and see. And let's all agree that if we don't start fighting for our way of life, then we will lose it. We're letting lunatics take control.\nLiz Host-West \n\nLoad-Date: January 9, 2017"
