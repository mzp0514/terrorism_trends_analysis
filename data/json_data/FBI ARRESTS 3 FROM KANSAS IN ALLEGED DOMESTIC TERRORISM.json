Prosecutors say the thwarted attack  was planned for the day after the November election.\n The arrests were the culmination of an eight-month FBI investigation that took agents \"deep into a hidden culture of hatred and violence,\" Acting U.S. Attorney Tom Beall said.\n A complaint unsealed Friday charges Curtis Wayne Allen, 49; Patrick Eugene Stein, 47; and Gavin Wayne Wright, 49, with conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction. Their first court appearance is Monday.\n The men are members of a small militia group that calls itself \"the Crusaders,\" and whose members espouse sovereign citizen, anti-government, anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant extremist beliefs, according to the complaint.\n The complaint alleges group members chose the target based on their hatred for Muslims, people of Somali descent and immigrants - and out of a desire to inspire other militia groups and \"wake people up.\"\n The FBI began a domestic terrorism investigation of the group in February, and a confidential source attended its meetings in southwestern Kansas.\n In a June meeting, Stein brought up the Orlando nightclub shooting, and proposed carrying out a similar attack against Muslim refugees in Garden City, according to the complaint.\n They ultimately decided to target the apartment complex because of the number of Somalis who lived there and the fact that one of the apartments was used as a mosque. The complex houses about 120 Somali residents, Beall said.\n\nLoad-Date: October 28, 2016"
