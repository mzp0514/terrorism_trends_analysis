    "full text": "Senator Mitch McConnell doesn't know who the next defense secretary will be, but that person evidently faces a tall order.\nIn a statement urging President Obama to choose a nominee with strong credentials and qualifications, Mr. McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and incoming majority leader, laid out an intimidating list of what he expects from the new Pentagon chief.\nHe said the successor to Chuck Hagel must be ready to confront such daunting tasks as: modernizing conventional military forces to meet the challenges posed by Russia and China; restructure the force after more than a decade of counterinsurgency warfare; maintain American dominance in the air and at sea; invest in the next generation of weapons systems to preserve America's nuclear triad; combat terrorism, whether from Al Qaeda, associated forces, the Islamic State or other groups seeking to exploit the ungoverned spaces created by revolt and unrest, with an all-volunteer force that faces a shortage of resources and investment. \nMr. McConnell also said that the eventual nominee must \"possess a sharp grasp of strategy, a demonstrated ability to think creatively, and the willingness and ability to work with Congress.\"\nInterested candidates should contact the White House.  \n\nLoad-Date: November 25, 2014"
