    "full text": "Hillary Rodham Clinton accused state Republicans yesterday of \"exploiting\" the bombing deaths of 17 U.S. sailors by blitzing voters with phone calls that charge she has \"Arab\" donors who embrace such terrorism.\n\"This is a new low,\" Clinton said, barely concealing anger as she met reporters in Ithaca. She said rival Rick Lazio and the GOP \"owe an apology to the families of the sailors\" killed in the Oct. 12 attack against the destroyer Cole in Yemen.\nThe congressman was unapologetic, even as he sought to distance himself from the phone-bank operation by saying, \"These are not phone calls that are done by my campaign.\"\n\"We don't need any advice from . . . Hillary Clinton how to run campaigns in New York, especially from people who are now forced to return $50,000 to people who associate themselves with terrorism and violence in the Middle East,\" he said after a rally with Gov. Pataki in West Babylon, L.I.\nThe state GOP defended the calls, although a central allegation in them appears to be inaccurate, and the GOP could not provide information to support it.\nIt was a day of harsh rhetoric that was unusual even for the overheated Senate race, and it suggested that Middle East politics will play a key role in the final days of the campaign.\nThe GOP phone banks are targeting more than 1 million voters - one message for Jews, another for non-Jews.\nNon-Jews hear that \"the Daily News reported . . . Clinton attended a $50,000 fund-raiser where she accepted a plaque and money from an Arab organization that openly brags about its support of a Mideast terrorism group, conducting the same kind of terrorism that killed 17 of our sailors.\"\nThe script read to Jewish voters doesn't mention the Cole bombing, but adds lines to say the \"Arab\" group backing her supports \"Hamas,\" which \"our own State Department calls a terrorist organization because of its attacks on Israeli victims. Mrs. Clinton's actions prove she is no friend of Israel.\"\nThe GOP launched the calls after the Daily News reported Wednesday that the American Muslim Alliance took credit for a fund-raiser that produced $50,000 for Clinton's candidacy.\nThe group's leader had told The News that while he backs the Palestinian cause through peaceful means \"first and foremost,\" he also accepts UN resolutions that allow for Palestinians to use armed force.\nClinton then returned the $50,000, saying she was never told of the group's involvement. She said she was offended by remarks attributed to members of the alliance and is a staunch supporter of Israel.\nThe News story did not state that the American Muslim Alliance backed terror groups, as the phone scripts claim.\nIt reported that Abdurahman Alamoudi, who has been supportive of Hamas and is a member of another group - the American Muslim Council - gave Clinton $1,000. Clinton also refunded that money.\nGOP spokesman Dan Allen said the scripts would not be changed. He said of the American Muslim Alliance, \"To get support from somebody like that is wrong.\"\nLazio also charged yesterday that Clinton's campaign tried to hide Alamoudi's donation by describing him in records as from the \"American Museum Council.\" A Clinton aide called the discrepancy a typographical error.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nAP CAMPUS CRUSH    Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton is greeted by fans at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., yesterday.\n\nLoad-Date: October 29, 2000"
