    "full text": "EUREKA - The Chicago-based consul general of Turkey brought a message of alliance and cooperation with the U.S. during a recent visit to Central Illinois. \n\"Turkey and the U.S. are two allies, two strategic partners cooperating in different parts of the world from the Balkans to Afghanistan, from Iraq to points in Africa and the Middle East,\" U. Kenan Ipek said before he talked to about 100 students at Eureka High School. \nThe modern Turkish Republic was formed in 1928, adopted an alphabet, became a secular country and today is a parliamentarian democracy, he said. \nOf its 71 million people, 96 percent are Muslim, but Ipek bragged of a \"togetherness of different faiths and religions.\" \nIpek visited Eureka and Farmington high schools through a program of the Turkish Cultural Foundation. Don Samford, a former Eureka High teacher, and teacher Chris Wells both visited Turkey with groups through the foundation. Samford also is affiliated with the Peoria World Affairs Council. \n\"Hopefully, programs like this will help to recognize the importance of Turkey to our own strategic interests,\" Wells said. \nToday, Ipek said, Turkey and the U.S. fight terrorism and also partnered to bring energy east to west, using Turkey as a hub. He anticipates no changes in that relationship with the new administration in Washington, D.C. \n\"International terrorism is the biggest threat to us now and to our future generations,\" he said. \"We have to keep this in mind.\" \n\nLoad-Date: February 3, 2009"
