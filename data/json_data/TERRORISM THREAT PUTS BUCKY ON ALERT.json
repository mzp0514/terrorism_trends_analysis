That street will be shut down for much of the day.\nBefore the orange alert, Mayor Sue Bauman and others criticized restrictions on Breese Terrace, saying that it is not reasonable to search local residents who drive on the street.\nSome neighborhood residents said the measures are disruptive but they're glad the threat is being taken seriously.\n\"It's kind of an inconvenience but I understand they have security measures they have to take,\" said UW-Madison senior Jill Beattie, 21, who lives on Chadbourne Avenue.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nWSJ graphic\n Source: Uw-Madiosn police\n Orange alert in place for football game\n\nLoad-Date: September 15, 2002"
