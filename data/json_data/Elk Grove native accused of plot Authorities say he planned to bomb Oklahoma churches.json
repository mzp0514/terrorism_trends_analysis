    "full text": "A former Elk Grove Village man has been arrested after police in Miami, Okla., said they found bomb-making materials and notes about destroying dozens of area churches.\nAuthorities on Friday charged 23-year-old Gregory Arthur Weiler II with possession of an explosive or incendiary device and violation of Oklahoma's anti-terrorism law.\nWeiler's family members in Elk Grove Village could not be reached for comment Saturday.\nThe Oklahoman reported Weiler was being held without bail at the Ottawa County jail.\nMiami police said the targets were churches in Ottawa County and that there were no further threats. An arrest affidavit says Miami police found detailed maps and torn-up notes that included a list of 48 churches in Weiler's motel room.\nPolice said empty bottles, duct tape and a gasoline can were found in the motel room.\nIt is unclear if Weiler has a lawyer.\nFBI spokesman Rick Rains in Oklahoma City confirmed Saturday night the bureau has taken over investigation of the case, though Weiler is still being held by state authorities on local charges.\n\"We are not releasing anything further because our investigation is ongoing,\" Rains said. \"They have turned that investigation over to us. It's certainly the norm that they would contact us. We're trying to determine whether or not there's federal violations.\"\nRains would not elaborate whether Weiler could be charged under federal anti-terrorism laws. Charges are likely from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\nMiami police also found a journal in Weiler's motel room. An entry read, \"Self Promote for the next 4 years while beginning list of goals written out in Oklahoma having to do with destroying and removing church buildings from U.S. a tiny bit at a time â€” setting foundation for the years to follow,\" according to the arrest affidavit.\n* The Associated Press and Oklahoman contributed to this\nreport.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nOklahoman Gregory Arthur Weiler II\n\nLoad-Date: October 8, 2012"
