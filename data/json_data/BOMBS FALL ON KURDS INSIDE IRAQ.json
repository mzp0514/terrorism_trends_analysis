    "full text": "BANIK, Iraq - Turkish planes bombed and strafed settlements in northern Iraq Saturday for a second day to try to drive Turkish Kurdish guerrillas from the border area, witnesses reported.  But the witnesses said Iraqi villages also came under attack, and they accused the Turks of using gasoline bombs.\nThere were no immediate reports of injuries on Saturday. At least eight people were wounded in Friday's raid.  Most of them were burned.  Reuters reported that Turkey had sent thousands of troops backed by planes and helicopters to crush the rebels. It quoted a military source.  The source said the soldiers had invaded Iraq near the towns of Cukurca and Uludere.  The Iraqi Kurds had left home after a failed Kurdish uprising against Saddam Hussein following the gulf war, and returned during the summer from the Turkish and Iranian borders with the aid of allied forces.  The air attack marked the second time in two months that Turkey has crossed into Iraq to seek out Turkish Kurdish guerrillas.  The rebels recently have stepped up their campaign for a separate state with strikes at Turkish military posts.  The Turkish government, seeking elections in a week, is under pressure to control terrorism. President Turgut Ozal flew to the Turkish border town of Diyarbakir on Saturday and was briefed by high-ranking army officials.\n\nLoad-Date: October 13, 1993"
