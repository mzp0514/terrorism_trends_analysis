    "full text": "Police said a 43-year-old Dubuque man was arrested Sunday for terrorizing his former supervisor at John Deere Dubuque Works for the past four years.\nRalph Weinbender, 978 Spires Court, faces a charge of fourth degree criminal mischief and a charge of terrorism.\nWeinbender was being held in the Dubuque County Jail on a $10,000 cash bond.  Terrorism carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.\nPolice said Weinbender fired six .22-caliber rounds in 1992 into a home on Clarke Crest Drive where Steven Ressler and his family were sleeping\nNo one was injured in the shooting but several bullets were lodged in the wall of the bedroom where Ressler's children were sleeping.\nRessler was Weinbender's supervisor at John Deere and participated i in an investigation which led to Weinbender's dismissal, police said.\nAlthough witnesses at the scene identified the make of car Weinbender drove, a Toyota Supra, police did not have enough evidence to obtain a search warrant;\nA warrant was obtained in the fall of 1995 for a second shooting incident that took place in 1993. Police said Weinbender used a BB gun to break a window in Ressler's home.\nThe search of Weinbender's home yielded a gun equipped with a silencer. Ballistic tests matched the six bullets recovered from Ressler's home to Weinbender's gun.\nSilencers are banned under state and federal law. Police have alerted the FBI about the silencer.\nRessler installed a security camera after the 1992 shooting and videotaped the BB gun shooting, but police were unable to identify Weinbender on the tape until last year.\nPoliee also said Weinbender on other occasions harassed the family and would often drive slowly past Ressler's house.\n\nLoad-Date: December 9, 1996"
