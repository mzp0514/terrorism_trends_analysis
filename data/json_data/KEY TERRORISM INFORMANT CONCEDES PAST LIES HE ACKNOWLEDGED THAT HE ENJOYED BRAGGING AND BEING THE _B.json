    "full text": "The government's key informant in the biggest terrorism trial in American history acknowledged yesterday that he was a braggart who lied to just about everyone about his background.\nEmad Salem, a shadowy former Egyptian military officer, told a federal jury in Manhattan that he enjoyed being a \"big shot\" and that when he came to the United States in 1987, he frequently lied about his professional past.\nSalem is the government's main informant in the trial of Sheik Omar Abdel- Rahman and 10 other defendants accused of plotting the fatal 1993 World Trade Center blast and of planning to blow up other U.S. landmarks.\nSalem's credibility may play a pivotal role in the trial's outcome. He infiltrated Abdel-Rahman's inner circle and learned of what prosecutors allege was a massive plot to \"wage a war of urban terrorism\" in the United States.\nUnder questioning by Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew McCarthy, Salem, a burly man with glasses, readily admitted lying to his former wife to impress her and said he portrayed himself as a \"big shot.\"\n\"I told her I was a big security (man) for the president of Egypt,\" Salem said in a heavy accent. \". . . I told her a lot of bragging stories.\"\n\"Did you tell these stories to just about anyone who would listen to you?\" McCarthy asked.\n\"Yes, sir,\" Salem said.\nHe testified that among those he lied to was an FBI agent who had asked him for help in an unrelated case. Salem also acknowledged lying during a civil trial involving a traffic accident.\nThe witness also said that he had a $1.056 million contract for helping the FBI in its probe of Abdel-Rahman and the others, and that he was being paid $7,000 every month. He said he had already been paid $116,000.\nBecause he is in the witness protection program, he is also receiving $2,700 a month from the U.S. Marshals Service, he said, adding that he had been relocated 14 times.\nDefense attorneys have argued that Salem had worked as a double agent for Egypt and the United States. They argue that he hatched the plan to entrap Abdel-Rahman, who advocates the overthrow of the Egyptian government.\nThen he lured the defendants into the scheme to earn more than a million\ndollars in fees from the FBI, the defense lawyers alleged.\nSalem testified yesterday that he had been contacted by members of Egyptian intelligence during the investigation but was not working for them.\n\nLoad-Date: October 28, 2002"
