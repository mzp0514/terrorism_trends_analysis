The Saudis also accuse Iran and Hezbollah of fanning the war in Yemen by supporting the Houthi rebels.\n Hezbollah, which has members in Lebanon's parliament and Cabinet, is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. government.\n Also Friday, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on two Yemen-based tribal leaders, Hashim Muhsin Aydarus al-Hamid and Khalid Ali Mabkhut al-Aradah.\n It said the two men facilitated the transfer of weapons and money and the movement of people in support of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, which has plotted attacks against the U.S.\n The Trump administration said the four men have \"committed, or pose a serious risk of committing, acts of terrorism\" and threaten U.S. national security.\n In all cases, the sanctions work to restrict those targeted from accessing funding or property.\n Trump  was scheduled to arrive in Riyadh on Saturday morning at the start of his five-stop trip across the Middle East and Europe.\n\nLoad-Date: July 28, 2017"
