    "full text": "Jan. 6--It's the kind of thing we all know -- and even like -- about Northwest Missouri, but it doesn't usually get printed on travel brochures.\nWe're not a prime terrorism target.\nWe do take the threat of terrorism seriously. With the clarity of distance, we realize that Sept. 11 was not an attack on New York or Washington, D.C., but an attack on the United States. I would venture to say that a lot more of the soldiers fighting terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan come from places like Hamilton, Mo., and Horton, Kan., than Chicago or Los Angeles.\nBut we also understand that if hijackers start flying planes into the Corby Building, they must be 1,200 miles off course.\nFor this reason, the region is an unlikely destination for Homeland Security funding. Some watchdog groups have criticized the way security grants have been distributed, saying too much is given to small towns and not enough to metro areas.\nMaybe we don't have flashing neon signs that attract attention from the caves of Tora Bora. But you know what we do have? Floods. Tornadoes. Heat waves. Ice storms.\nWhen the Great Ice Storm of 2007 hit, the planning and preparation spurred by Sept. 11 paid off for this region. Within hours after the power going off, emergency shelters were opened in many towns. Communities were organized in their response, communicating with residents and with other towns to get resources where they were most needed.\nFifteen counties in the region received nearly $900,000 in 2006 for Homeland Security. Most of it went to training and equipment. The thing we've seen is that equipment and training can be put to use for any type of emergency -- from a dirty bomb to a flash flood to a child kidnapping.\nEven with the federal funding, most of the disaster relief was provided by volunteers. Most shelters were located in community buildings and churches, with volunteers coming in from around the country to help with feeding and clean up.\nTerrorist attacks have been blessedly rare in the United States. It makes sense to spend money on things that allow us to prepare for the inevitable natural disasters and also be useful for the remote possibilities. As the Hurricane Katrina catastrophe showed, it can be useful to have resources deployed around the country.\nJust in case people need to flee the city from a disaster -- caused by an angry terrorist or raging Mother Nature -- they can be sure small-town America will have a shelter open for them.\nBusiness editor Susan Mires writes a weekly column.\nTo see more of the St. Joseph News-Press or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.stjoenews-press.com/.
