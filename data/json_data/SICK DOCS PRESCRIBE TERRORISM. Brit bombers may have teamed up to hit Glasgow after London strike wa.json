Another doctor and a medical student are thought to be from the Middle East.\nAll the suspects worked for Britain's National Health Service, some together at hospitals in England and Scotland.\nThe Guardian newspaper reported today that investigators believe the plotters were directed by a single mastermind based outside Britain, but do not yet know the identity of the \"guiding hand.\"\nExperts and officials doubt the suspects could have hatched the plot themselves overseas before immigrating to Britain, especially because they come from far-flung homelands.\n\"I think that's a planning impossibility,\" said Bob Ayres, a former U.S. intelligence officer. \"A much more likely scenario is they were here together. They discovered that they shared some common ideology, and then they decided to act on this.\"\nDr. Shiv Panbe, former chairman of the British International Doctors Association, said he shared public disgust that medical doctors could be involved in a plot that could have killed scores.\n\"It is very upsetting news,\" Panbe said. \"It is an abuse of trust and respect. Everyone should be able to love their doctor.\"\ndgoldiner@nydailynews.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \nCops bust one of would-be bombers after Saturday attack at Glasgow Airport.
