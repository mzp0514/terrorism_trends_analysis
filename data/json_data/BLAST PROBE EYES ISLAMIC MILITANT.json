They did not identify the sites.\nAlbright and Freeh praised Yemen for its \"early cooperation.\" The FBI was given full access to the sites, and it sent key evidence to Washington for detailed lab tests. But they are seeking more access now.\n\"The next critical phase will require Yemeni and U.S. personnel to work as partners in the collection of information and participants in the interview process of witnesses to this criminal act of terrorism,\" Albright and Freeh said.\n\nLoad-Date: October 29, 2000"
