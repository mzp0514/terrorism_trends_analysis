Thomas, said Cook was not provided treatment for a mental illness.\nIn September, Judge Jennifer Hightower ordered Cook to undergo a mental evaluation to determine his fitness to stand trial, saying at the time that she had \"a bona fide doubt about the Defendant's fitness for trial.\"\nAssociate Judge Phil Alfeld told attorneys this week that Cook was found to be mentally fit.\nCharges were brought by Madison County State's Attorney Tom Gibbons after Gibbons said Cook \"knowingly provided material support or resources with the intention that that material support or resources would be used in the support of a terrorist act by a terrorist organization.\"\nMaterial support for terrorism is punishable by up to 40 years in the Illinois Department of Corrections, and making a terrorist threat is punishable up to 30 years, Gibbons said.\nCook is being held in the Madison County Jail in lieu of $150,000 bail.\n___ (c)2016 the Jacksonville Journal-Courier (Jacksonville, Ill.)
