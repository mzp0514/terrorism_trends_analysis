The jury was deadlocked on nine other charges.\nToday, Al-Arian remains behind bars at the Orient Road Jail. That's where about 150 supporters gathered Sunday to call for the release of the former University of South Florida professor.\nHolding signs that read \"Justice Delayed is Justice Denied\" and \"The Jury Has Spoken,\" the group sang folk songs and listened to speakers, including religious leaders and civil rights activists from across the country.\nBetween speeches, the demonstrators chanted, \"Free Sami now.\"\nSeveral speakers, including Eric Vickers, a St. Louis lawyer, met with Al-Arian before the rally. Vickers said federal prosecutors had abused unlimited power during the trial, and are using that power to trump the jury's decision.\n\"Sami Al-Arian has called into question what this nation is all about,\" Vickers said.\nOther speakers read statements of support for Al-Arian from Amnesty International and the National Council of Churches.\nVicki Walker, a Tampa minister and National Council member, urged the crowd to also offer support for Al-Arian's wife, Nahla, who was among the supporters gathered Sunday.\n\"As long as Sami is not free, she is not free,\" Walker said before returning to the crowd to hug Nahla Al-Arian and clasp her hand for the rest of the rally.\nAl-Arian's three co-defendants - Ghassan Ballut, Hatim Fariz and Sameeh Hammoudeh - also were acquitted of terrorism charges. The jury was hung on several of the charges against Fariz, but acquitted the other men on all charges.\nHammoudeh is in a Bradenton jail awaiting deportation. He was expected to leave for Jordan with his wife and children earlier this month, but his release was delayed.\nAhmed Bedier, director of Central Florida's branch of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said it was a violation of Hammoudeh's and his family's rights to keep him incarcerated when he's been exonerated by a jury.\nHammoudeh's family \"is in a dangerous part of the world without the head of the household to take care of them,\" he said.\nFederal prosecutors say they hope to retry Al-Arian and Fariz on the unsettled charges later this year.\nReporter Julie Pace can be reached at (813) 865-1505.\nPhoto credit: News Channel 8 photo by JIM FARQHAR\nPhoto: Demonstrators chanted \"Free Sami now\" Sunday at the Orient Road Jail as they protested the continuing incarceration of Sami Al-Arian, who has been acquitted of several terrorism charges.\nCopyright Â© 2006, The Tampa Tribune and may not be republished without permission.
