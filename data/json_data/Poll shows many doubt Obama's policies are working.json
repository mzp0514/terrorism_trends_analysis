    "full text": "Apr. 3--HIGH POINT -- Many North Carolinians say President Obama has not handled the economy well despite the claims he made Friday in Charlotte that the economy is turning up after a deep recession.\nThe president hailed a new government report showing stronger job growth and credited his policies with helping businesses rebuild.\nBut results of a High Point University poll show 57 percent of North Carolinians disapprove of how President Obama is handling the economy, compared to 36 percent approving his actions. And 56 percent believe that economic conditions in North Carolina are getting worse while 59 percent believe that the government has not done enough to address the economic crisis.\nObama's appearance at Celgard in Charlotte, a firm that produces material for lithium batteries and has received $49 million from the stimulus program, came just days after passage of health care legislation that 51 percent of North Carolinians opposed before and after passage, according to the HPU survey.\nThirty-eight percent supported the legislation. In addition, 55 percent of those surveyed disapprove of the way Obama has handled health care and 38 percent approve.\nThe survey of 578 residents was conducted over a two-week period in March. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.\nHere are some other survey results:\n--Terrorism: Fifty percent of North Carolinians approve of Obama's handling of the terrorism threat, 39 percent disapprove. While 53 percent believe the U.S. government is doing at least fairly well in reducing the threat of terrorism, a near majority of 47 percent say further attacks on the U.S. are very likely.\n--Education: A 52-percent majority of North Carolinians approve of how Obama is handling education, compared to 32 percent who disapprove. But just 47 percent approve of the national government developing standards for all public schools while 45 percent disapprove. A 64-percent majority rejects paying teachers based on their students' standardized test scores, while 29 percent approve.\ndnivens@hpe.com -- 888-3626\nTo see more of the High Point Enterprise, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.hpe.com.
