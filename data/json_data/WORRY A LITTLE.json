We are very aware that if muggings, assaults, and other crimes against visitors become the story of these Games, then we have failed.\"\nThe Olympic security team did not fail because of any reporting of pickpockets and such. Rather the headlines of the< ze>*'96 Games focused on (1) Michael Johnson exploding to a record-shattering 19.32 seconds in the 200-meter finals, shaving 0.34 seconds from his old mark, and (2) a pipeir15p10,16l>bomb explosion in Centennial Olympic Park, killing two and injuring more than 100.\nWhile Atlanta knew how to stop terrorism, it focused on other things and could not stop a simple pipe bomb. Sydney's cops and the IOC chairman say possible terrorism does not worry them - but it should.\n\nLoad-Date: September 6, 2000"
