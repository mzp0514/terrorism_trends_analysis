    "full text": "Palestinians threw stones and burned American flags in the streets of the West Bank on Wednesday, rejecting a new U.S. attempt to salvage the disintegrating Mideast peace process.\nPresident Clinton sent envoy Dennis Ross to try to stop the rioting and bloodshed that started after Israel broke ground for construction of a Jewish neighborhood in disputed east Jerusalem.\nBut Palestinians have grown suspicious of America's motives in peacemaking, because it blocked U.N. Security Council censure of the housing project.\nSupporters of Yasser Arafat led protests here and in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, hurling stones and bottles at Israeli soldiers. Soldiers responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, injuring 20 Palestinians.\nIsrael demanded Ross tell Arafat to rein in the violence - both the daily rioting in the West Bank and terror attacks, such as a suicide bombing that killed three Israeli women at a Tel Aviv cafe on Friday.\n\"Terrorists will always have a grievance, (but) terrorism cannot exist in a vacuum, it needs a sponsoring government,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at a conference on terrorism. \"They have chosen to use terrorism as a weapon of political coercion.\"\nIsrael also offered an incentive to the Palestinians, with Netanyahu aide David Bar-Illan suggesting in an interview with The Associated Press that Israel might ease its closure of the West Bank if Palestinian security officials resume cooperative efforts to block terror attacks on Israelis. Israel imposed the closure, which keeps tens of thousands of workers from jobs in Israel, after the bombing.\n\nLoad-Date: April 7, 1997"
