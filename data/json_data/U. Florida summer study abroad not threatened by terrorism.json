    "full text": "More University of Florida students are studying abroad this Summer than the last -- even after, or maybe because of, Sept. 11.\nMany students were frightened to travel after Sept. 11, but that fear quickly subsided, said Dennis Jett, dean of the UF International Center.\n\"It [Sept. 11] has even encouraged people to study abroad to learn about the world beyond our borders because they realize what a significant impact it plays on our national lives,\" he said.\nU. Florida\nStudents, Jett said, are beginning to understand the importance of international study for building a resume and becoming exposed to other cultures.\nThe number of UF students studying abroad this Summer is 840, 100 more than last year, said study abroad adviser Lyn Straka.\nThis is significant because 70 percent of UF students who study abroad each year do so during Summer.\nDerek Thomas, a UF history and political science senior, is traveling to Barcelona to study Spanish during Summer B.\n\"I knew I was going to do it at some point,\" Thomas said. \"I want to go in the Peace Corps when I graduate, so it's a good experience.\"\nHe said he was not worried about the threat of terrorism while he was out of the country, but was taking British Airways \"just to be safe.\"\n\"Eighty percent of our students travel to Western Europe, and the situation there is no more dangerous than it is here in the U.S.,\" Jett said. \"Students have to take the kinds of precautions any traveler would take, even in quieter times.\"\nThe International Center conducts orientation each semester to make sure students are aware of possible risks, he said, but the possibility of health problems or common crime are far greater than the risk of terrorism.\nUF will not sponsor study abroad programs to any country where the State Department issues a travel warning.\nThe International Center was faced with a dilemma in November 2000 when the Department of State issued travel advisory for Israel while students were studying abroad there.\nThe center canceled all programs to Israel but allowed the students already in the country to finish the semester, because it was thought to be in their best interest.\nSome situations are even more worrisome.\n\"Obviously, if we had students in India right now we'd advise them to come home,\" Jett said.\n\"If an incident happens overseas, it gets magnified, and puts UF at a greater risk for focus, and we're aware of that,\" he said.\nHe said students, parents and International Center staff are more attuned to security issues this year than in the past.\n\"Our policy has always been to make safety a priority,\" Jett said.\n\"That's not something we discovered after Sept. 11.\"\nAmanda Mulligan, an agricultural and life sciences senior, boarded a plane bound for a summer of learning Spanish in Seville, Spain, although she had never been out of the country before and was worried about the possibility of a terrorist attack.\n\"It's always been my dream to come to Spain,\" Mulligan said in an e-mail from Seville.\nShe said that once she got through the security hassles and the flight, she felt safe and was having a wonderful time.\n(C) 2002 Independent Florida Alligator via U-WIRE\n\nLoad-Date: June 11, 2002"
