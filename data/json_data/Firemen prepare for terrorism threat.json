Trust your buddy.\"\nThere was laughter.\n\"That's OK,\" said Stewart to Jimmy May, the man holding the safety rope attached to his harness. \"I didn't notice that you were late this morning.\"\nMore laughter.\nWhile the atmosphere atop the tower that day was jovial and light, the Brunswick Fire Department was serious about its new special operations program, of which the day's rope rescue program was a part.\n\"We have a saying around the department,\" said Stewart, \"and that is that Murphy was an optimist.\"\nStewart was referring to Murphy's Law, which states that anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.\nIn the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the emphasis on special operations had increased across the nation, but Stewart said that his department was ahead of the curve.\n\"Before 9/11, we did an anthrax training drill, and we had our training tower stand in as City Hall,\" he said. \"It was great because we already had a protocol in place before the real anthrax panic hit.\"\nThe demand for special operations training in fire departments across the country had increased, and so had federal funding for training and equipment.\nStewart was expecting over $100,000 in federal money for the city department in the following year.\n\"With special operations, if you don't use it, you lose it,\" said Stewart. \"The more we learn, the less we realize we know.\"\nTo see more of The Brunswick News or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.thebrunswicknews.com/.
