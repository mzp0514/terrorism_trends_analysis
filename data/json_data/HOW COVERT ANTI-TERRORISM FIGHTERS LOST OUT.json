His observations deserve attention in the wake of the controversy over President Reagan's recent comments on this subject.\nLetter from Reed Irvine on book Our Man Is Inside, by former US Amb to Colombia Asencio, on how damage done to CIA in 1970's impaired US ability to combat terrorism\nAmbassador Asencio states that the only method he knows of to combat terrorism effectively is ''a system of enhanced intelligence collection and analysis.'' He points out that in the 1970's, when the C.I.A. was under attack in our press and in Congress, it ''gave up most of the resources it had devoted to the internal subversive movements of Latin America.'' He says that ''the agency cut loose not only many experienced U.S. agents, but more important, its assets abroad that had formerly been used to penetrate, infiltrate, and collect data on the clandestine political world of the Southern Hemisphere. . .  ''There was a time not too long ago when it was impossible for the proverbial swallow to fall without its being reported by the C.I.A. Since then, its capabilities have been severely compromised . . . . An informational gap formed as a result of this compromised capacity for gathering intelligence, and I almost died as a result of it.'' Perhaps the President was closer to the truth than his critics.\n \nREED IRVINE Washington, Oct. 2, 1984\nThe writer is chairman of Accuracy in Media Inc."
