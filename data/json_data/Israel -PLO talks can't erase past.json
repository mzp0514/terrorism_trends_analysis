    "full text": "Your chronology ''Selected Turns in Israeli-PLO Conflict,'' July\n1, distorts and omits several key incidents.\nMost egregious is the omission of incidents of PLO terrorism\nagainst Israeli civilians that formed the core and defined the\ncourse of Israeli-PLO relations.\nThe PLO's current political\napproach does not erase 25 years of violence and bloodshed. Also\nmissing is the 1964 PLO charter, which called for the destruction\nof Israel, and PLO support for Iraq's 1989 invasion of Kuwait.\nFinally, Israel's invasion of Lebanon in June 1982 did not\nscuttle the rest of the Camp David accords. From the beginning, the\nPalestinians had consistently rejected the autonomy arrangements\nenvisioned in the accords. Today's welcome progress in Israel-PLO\nrelations should not serve as a pretense for rewriting history.\nBluma Zuckerbot, New York\nAnti-Defamation League\n \n Your letters are welcome.
