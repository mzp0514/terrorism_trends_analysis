    "full text": "Islamic leaders ended a summit meeting here today by urging military aid for the Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina and vowing to combat religious fanaticism.\nBut appeals for unity were undercut by issues that remained unresolved at the close of a three-day meeting of the 52-member Organization of the Islamic Conference.\nKing Hussein of Jordan failed to gain a mention in the final document of his country's role in overseeing Muslim holy sites in East Jerusalem; Palestinians objected out of fear that it would weaken their claim to sovereignty over that sector of the city. Iraq was angered by a resolution calling for it to refrain from menacing its neighbors and to comply with United Nations resolutions stemming from its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.\nBut participants did agree on a 182-article communique covering issues from terrorism in the Islamic world to technology and culture.\nPresident Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia attended as an observer and his Government received pledges of aid ranging from $300,000 to $5 million. The Islamic nations said they would cooperate with any United Nations members \"who exhibit a willingness on their own initiative to provide Bosnia with the means for self-defense.\"\nThe leaders also approved a separate document that complained about \"a ferocious campaign to tarnish Islam,\" denounced religious fanaticism and called for an effort to \"rectify misconceptions\" that have associated Islam with violence.\n\nLoad-Date: December 16, 1994"
