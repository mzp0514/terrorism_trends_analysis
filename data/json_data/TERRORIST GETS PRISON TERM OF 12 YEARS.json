    "full text": "FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) - Susanne Albrecht, who rejected her affluent background and turned to terrorism, was convicted Monday in the slaying of a banker and the attempted killing of Alexander M. Haig Jr., then the NATO commander.  Albrecht, 40, was immediately sentenced to 12 years in prison by the upper state court in the southern city of Stuttgart.\nShe could be eligible for parole in six years.  Chief Judge Kurt Breucker cited Albrecht's confession, her cooperation with authorities and her statement renouncing terrorism as factors in the relatively light sentence. She could have been given life in prison.  The judge said Albrecht's testimony about the Red Army Faction, to which she belonged until 1980, ''destroyed a pillar''' of the leftist terror group.  She was found guilty of participating in the murder of Dresdner Bank chief Juergen Ponto in July 1977 and of helping carry out the bombing attack in June 1977 on Haig, also a former U.S. secretary of state. She was found guilty on three other attempted murder charges, too.  The bomb exploded as Haig was being driven to work outside Brussels, but it went off too late and he was unhurt. Three bodyguards riding in a car behind were injured.  Albrecht, daughter of a prominent Hamburg lawyer, was found guilty also of leading two other terrorists into the home of Ponto, a friend of her family.  Ponto was shot while resisting a kidnapping attempt. She had confessed to her role in the murder.  After leaving the Red Army Faction in early 1980, Albrecht hid i n what was East Germany under an assumed name until June 1990, when she was caught in a sweep that netted eight other suspected terrorists.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPhoto; Photo Headshot â€¦ Alexander M.
