    "full text": "The United States did not violate the agreement under which it serves as host country to the United Nations when it barred the P.L.O. chairman, Yasir Arafat, from entering the country to address the General Assembly, Secretary of State George P. Shultz said today.\nThe treaty prohibits the United States from creating any impediment to the entry of those having business at the United Nations, Mr. Shultz acknowledged.\n''But we carefully preserved our right to exclude people who we think threaten the security interests of the United States,'' he said on the ABC News program ''This Week.''\n''There is a law in the United States that finds the P.L.O. to be a terrorist organization and denies visas to members of the P.L.O.,'' the Secretary of State said.\n''Do we have the right to exclude anybody that the U.N. invites? The answer to that is, clearly, yes, we do,'' Mr. Shultz continued. ''And then, second, within the scope of that reservation, given our law, was it proper to exclude Arafat on the grounds of terrorism and terrorism's relationship to our security? And I think the answer to that is yes.''\nHe said he is comfortable with the decision he made a week earlier to bar Mr. Arafat, even though only Israel backed the United States when the decision was condemned by the General Assembly."
