He said Harzi is one of two Tunisians reportedly arrested Oct. 3 in Turkey when they tried to enter the country with false passports.\nThe person spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information. Harzi's alleged role in the attack is not clear.\n- the associated press\nAnwar denied there was any evidence that Ali was implicated in the attacks. He added his client was not using a fake passport, saying he was a \"scapegoat to satisfy the Americans.''\nThe charge against Harzi is punishable by six to 12 years in prison, according to the provisions of the anti-terrorist law in force in Tunisia since 2003.\nThe suspect has ties to both Ansar al-Shariah and Al Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, as do most like-minded militants in the region, the official said.\n- the associated press\n\nLoad-Date: October 25, 2012"
