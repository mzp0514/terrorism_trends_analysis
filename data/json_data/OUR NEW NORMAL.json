    "full text": "Before the war on terror, passing through security at Lambert Field was a simple process. A trip to the Arch meant dodging traffic, not anti-terrorism barriers. Funerals at Jefferson Barracks were rare for active-duty soldiers. In the five years since 9/11, our lives -- from family to faith, from business to politics -- have changed in obvious and subtle ways.\nMourning those killed in war\nMichelle Leonard of Bellefontaine Neighbors visits the grave of her brother, Marco Damian Ross, on Aug. 25 at Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery. Army Spc. Ross, 20, died Aug. 25, 2004, in a military camp in Baghdad, Iraq. \"The world will just never be the same\" since Sept. 11, 2001, she says, \"because I lost my little brother fighting against the war on terrorism.\"\nMiddle East issues at the forefront\nThe image of a woman's eyes peering out of a hijab has stirred up phone calls to its billboard advertiser. Jeff Allen, program director for radio station 97.1 FM Talk, says the station wanted to show that on-air personalities talk about conflict in the Middle East and the war on terror.\nSurging patriotism\nLast month, Hatida Residi (left) and Sue Charlebille, Flag Loft seamstresses, fold a flag that has been repaired and cleaned. After 9/11, the demand was high for flags, says Maureen Kelly, Flag Loft co-owner. Five years later, Flag Loft's residential sales have decreased because, Kelly says, of the availability of flags at bigger retail stores.\nTighter security\nThe Transportation Security Administration collects more than 175 pounds a month of items that are surrendered by passengers at Lambert Field's security checkpoints, says Deborah Craig, screening manager. Immediately after Sept. 11, 2001, she says, screeners were collecting about 300 pounds a month.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO\n (1) PHOTO - Michelle Leonard of Bellefontaine Neighbors visits the grave of her brother, Marco Damian Ross, on Aug. 25 at Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery.
