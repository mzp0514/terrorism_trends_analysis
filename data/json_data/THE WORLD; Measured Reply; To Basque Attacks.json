    "full text": "Although military extremists failed in February to overthrow Spanish democracy, Basque extremists have been taunting them to try it again. In the past 10 days, they have murdered two army colonels.\nBasque extremists attempt to provoke military extremists to overthrow Spanish democracyIn reaction, the Government last week gave in to military pressure and deployed army troops in the Basque provinces and on Spain's porous border with France.\nIt also promised to expedite legislation allowing for the detention of alleged terrorist informants and to introduce a bill defining and authorizing - in order of gravity - a state of alarm, a state of emergency and a state of siege.\nSeeking to provoke repression in the belief that it will lead to separatist revolution, the so-called military wing of E.T.A. (Basque Homeland and Liberty) was probably as disappointed as army hardliners that Prime Minister Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo didn't immediately declare a state of alarm. That step would have suspended constitutional guarantees and throttled fledgling Basque home rule.  However, the Prime Minister is trying to calm the armed forces without alienating the Basque majority, which has grown increasingly opposed to E.T.A. terror.\nThe middle course is strongly supported by King Juan Carlos, who summoned the heads of Spain's armed forces last week and warned them not to rise to provocation. Basque terrorism, he said, was aimed at splitting their ranks ''so that nerves crack and serenity is lost.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nBarbara Slavin and Milt Freudenheim"
