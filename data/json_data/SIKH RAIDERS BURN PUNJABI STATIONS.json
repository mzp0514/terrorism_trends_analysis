    "full text": "Scores of masked Sikh terrorists, armed with guns, bombs and gasoline, set fire to at least 37 small railroad stations in the countryside of Punjab state today.\n Reports from the Punjab quoted officials as saying there had been no casualties in the incidents, which occurred between midnight and 5 A.M. this morning.\nA terrorist group that has taken responsibility for several slayings, including the assassination of a senior Hindu politician, said tonight that it was responsible for the attacks, a new development in Punjabi terrorism.\nPrime Minister Indira Gandhi held an urgent Cabinet meeting today to review the situation. There was no indication any new measures were proposed to contain the trouble.\nA man who telephoned the office of the Press Trust of India news agency at Jullundur and identified himself as a member of the ''Dishmish Regiment'' threatened ''bigger action'' if a ban on a militant Sikh student organization, the All India Sikh Students Federation, was not lifted.\nThe Dishmish Regiment is said to be composed of followers of the tenth and last Sikh guru, Govind Singh, who hastened the militarization of the Sikhs in the late 17th and early 18th centuries.\nEstimates of damage done to railway property in the arson attacks were not available, but officials said many record books and buildings were destroyed. At least four stations were attacked with bombs in the raids, which took place simultaneously in 9 of the state's 12 districts.\n''This appears to be developing into a Northern Ireland type of situation,'' said one opposition politician, a former adviser to Mrs. Gandhi. He added that the Government seemed to have ''run out of ideas on how to tackle Punjab.''"
