Then, he would strengthen security at the nation's borders and entrance points.\nBefore the United States went into Iraq, leaders should have listed six to eight points of what that they wanted to accomplish, Wilmot said. Once those were attained, the United States would withdraw.\n\"The way it's going now, we're never going home,\" he said. \"Come on, taxpayers, wake up. ... It's time to protect our own shores.\"\nA blunt-spoken veteran of Vietnam, Wilmot didn't \"get\" the strategy the United States employed in that war, fighting in the south rather than going after the enemy that was in the north of Vietnam.\nRather than fighting to win, he said, it was, \"a way to kill a bunch of people.\"\nWith the Iraq war, Wilmot wants a national referendum to decide if U.S. troops should stay there or come home. Voters would know that if they approved staying, it would mean reinstating the draft in order to get the troops necessary to squash the terrorists.\n\"Maybe it needs to be that gripping,\" Wilmot said. \"Cut the rhetoric.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \nRichard Wilmot\n\nLoad-Date: July 21, 2006"
