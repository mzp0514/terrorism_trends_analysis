Murrah Building in Oklahoma City, authorities in Richmond began crafting a terrorism response plan.\nThey are reassessing the city's readiness after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.\n\"Nowhere in our plan had we prepared for anything like this. . . . We had prepared for one incident,\" said Richmond Fire Chief Jack McElfish.\nRichmond Police Chief Jerry Oliver said local authorities are not as prepared as they could be to deal with a threat. \"As a result of what happened, we will rethink the way we approach these things,\" he said yesterday.\nLocal police, fire and emergency services officials updated the City Council's Public Safety Committee on terrorism response during a meeting at the Police Training Academy.\nOliver said the city must generate confidence among residents that it can respond to terrorism swiftly, effectively and in coordinated fashion, \"that the government can come in after something like this happens and we can pick up the pieces and roll with it.\"\nMeanwhile, Richmond will remain in constant touch with federal authorities. \"We will never go back to 'at ease,' so to speak,\" Oliver said.\nRichmond is one of 125 cities in the country receiving training, funding and guidance under the Nunn-Lugar domestic preparedness program. Of nine area hospitals, however, only the Medical College of Virginia Hospitals has participated in this training.\nJerry Overton, executive director of the Richmond Ambulance Authority, said there was a communications breakdown among local medical centers as word spread that patients were being transported from Northern Virginia after the Pentagon attack. As it turns out, no patients came to Richmond.\n\"[The hospitals] did lack coordination, and they have unanimously stated they will be involved\" in future training, Overton said.\nPolice responded to the Sept. 11 attacks and subsequent rumors by increasing normal staffing by 33 percent in the two days following the attack, said Richmond Police Major David McCoy. The extra manpower cost $20,000.\nOfficers were immediately assigned to water treatment plants, City Hall, the state Capitol and federal buildings. The FBI passed on a tip that the Federal Reserve was a target but it proved not to be credible, McCoy said.\nThe attack has put on hold the training of 20 Saudi Arabian police officers by the Richmond Police Department, out of fears for their safety. The Saudi government is paying the city to train the officers in areas such as community policing.\nAccording to police Maj. Francis J. Monahan, the door to one Saudi apartment had been kicked, but that could have been a drunken act unrelated to the terrorist attack. Otherwise, there have been no other incidents involving the Saudi visitors.\nDr. Norma Hood Murdoch-Kitt, a licensed clinical psychologist, urged city officials to ensure evacuation procedures for local high-rises, safeguard underground parking beneath those buildings and develop contingency communications, such as hand-held radios, for local schools.\n\"We certainly don't want all 27,000 parents going to the schools to pick up their children,\" Murdoch-Kitt said.\nShe spent last week with colleagues from the American Psychological Association doing a \"crisis debriefing\" of Senate and White House employees.\nLater, Murdoch-Kitt described the evacuation of the Capitol as chaotic. No alarm sounded. Officers did not realize the problem until they saw members of Congress fleeing the floor. Women were told to remove their high heels and run; that a plane was headed for the building. \"Nothing worked,\" she said.\n\"We need to learn from their mess and try to mitigate damage here,\" Murdoch-Kitt said.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPhoto\n\nLoad-Date: September 27, 2001"
