Feldman, the chairman and chief executive of General Physics' parent company, GP Strategies Corp.\nFounded in the 1960s, General Physics' disaster-training business got its first big boost in 1979 when the Three Mile Island nuclear plant accident occurred, showing the need for training employees in how to react to a disaster.\nSince Sept 11, the company's training contracts have skyrocketed. Last week, it was awarded a $15 million deal from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to expand its training of first responders throughout the country.\nSo far, General Physics has trained 28,000 first responders in 150 jurisdictions including Boston, Miami and Seattle, said Tom Davis, a General Physics executive vice president.\nWhile this number appears impressive, it's just scratching the surface of the thousands that still need to be trained.\nPart of the problem has been funding.\nDespite the Department of Homeland Security's $40.2 billion budget request for fiscal 2005, the National League of Cities says the amount is inadequate. The organization argues the current budget is $800 million less than what's needed to pay for municipalities' first responder programs.\nThe U.S. Conference of Mayors and the National League of Cities estimate that more than $3 billion has been spent by cities on terrorism preparedness.\nIn addition, federal grants already approved for such training are commonly distributed slowly rather than all at once, local officials claim.\nA lack of funding at a time when state and local budgets are tight makes it difficult for many cities to justify budgeting for an attack that may never come, Feldman said.\n\"I wish the threat of terrorist attacks would just go away,\" he said. \"But it won't, so we have to be prepared.\"\n\nLoad-Date: February 9, 2004"
