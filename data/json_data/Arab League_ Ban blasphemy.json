    "full text": "UNITED NATIONS - The head of the Arab League called Wednesday for the international community to criminalize blasphemy, warning that insults to religion pose a serious threat to global peace and security. The comments put him squarely at odds with the United States and many of its western allies, which are resolutely opposed to restrictions on freedom of expression. \nAlso at Wednesday's U.N. Security Council session, the U.S. and Russia offered starkly differing assessments of the situation in Syria, underscoring the global body's inability to unite around a strategy to end the Arab country's civil war. Whereas Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton decried Syrian President Bashar Assad's \"murdering of his own people,\" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused the U.S. and other countries of encouraging terrorism. But perhaps the most controversial argument came from the Arab League's Nabil Elaraby, who told the U.N. Security Council that if the west has criminalized acts that result in bodily harm, it must also criminalize acts that insult or cause offense to religions. He condemned the violence that erupted throughout the Muslim world in response to an anti-Islam film produced in the United States. But, he said that unless blasphemy laws are enacted and enforced, similar incidents could happen again. \"While we fully reject such actions that are not justifiable in any way, we would like to ring the warning bell,\" Elaraby said. \"We are warning that offending religions, faiths and symbols is indeed a matter that threatens in international peace and security now.\" \"If the international community has criminalized bodily harm, it must just as well criminalize psychological and spiritual harm,\" he said.\n\nLoad-Date: September 27, 2012"
