The French deployment against terrorism in the region is called Operation Barkhane.\nFrance, the former colonial power, is the only Western country with a significant military presence waging counterinsurgency operations in Mali and the wider Sahel, the arid region of West Africa south of the Sahara. Islamist militants, some allied with the Islamic State, have carried out attacks in several countries, terrorizing populations and undermining governments.\nThe French Army command confirmed the death toll in the operation on Saturday, which it said took place overnight near the Mauritanian border, about 90 miles northwest of the town of Mopti in Mali.\nLast month, 13 French soldiers died in a helicopter crash in another part of Mali, near the border with Niger.\nPHOTO: President Emmanuel Macron of France speaking in Ivory Coast on Saturday.
