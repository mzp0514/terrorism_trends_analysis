Tunisia has said to have opened up their own investigation into the crime \"'outside national borders.'\"\nThe Associated Press reported that, because of the attack, the country had increased their threat level to maximum and that the number of boots on the ground to \"protect schools and religious sites\" would be increased from 3,000 to 7,000 soldiers. \nFrance, Germany, the United kingdom and many others have raised their terrorist levels following a string of attacks against citizens in several European cities. (Envato)\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has strongly condemned the attacks, vowing that the country would \"'never give in'\" to them, according to BBC. In addition, he expressed support for cartoonists in the country that published cartoon depictions of Mohammed, something that is forbidden in the Islamic religion.\nA few days later, on Nov. 3, a proclaimed \"ISIS sympathizer\" committed a terrorist attack in Vienna, Austria that left four people dead, according to NPR.\nNPR reported that the shooter, 20-year-old Kujtim Fejzulai, who was a dual citizen of North Macedonia and Austria, had attempted to travel to Syria last year to join the Islamic State. Fejzulai was arrested and sentenced to 22 months in prison, but was released seven months later due to laws regarding prison tenures for young adults. \nAccording to the Associated Press, the man opened fire on people who were out patronizing restaurants before a lockdown went into effect due to the coronavirus. One of the locations included a synagogue that was closed due to restrictions for the virus as well. \nAustrian Prime Minister Sebastian Kurz said, according to the Associated Press, that it is possible that the attack was anti-Semitic due to the shooting taking place outside of a synagogue. Kurz further praised police for their response and echoed statements similar to Macron. \n\"'We will not never allow ourselves to be intimidated by terrorism and will fight these attacks with all means,'\" Kurz said.\nIn anticipation of potential attacks spreading across Europe, according to NBC News, the U.K. has raised their terror threat level to \"severe,\" which is the second-highest level. The decision, announced by Home Secretary Priti Patel, stated that it was a precautionary measure and did not indicate any imminent attack on the country. \nNBC News reported that Neil Basu, the assistant commissioner of Counter Terrorism Policing in the U.K., urged the public to remain vigilant and to expect an increase in police presence in the near future.\n\nLoad-Date: November 20, 2020"
