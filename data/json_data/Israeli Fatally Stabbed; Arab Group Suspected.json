    "full text": "An Israeli farm worker was found stabbed to death today just hours before Israel shut down for Yom Kippur, the most sacred Jewish holy day.\nYigal Vaaknin, 21, was the first Israeli killed since Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization signed an accord in Washington on Sept. 13. His body was found in a field outside the town of Ranana. The police said that they suspected Arabs opposed to the accord in the killing and that an autopsy indicated that Mr. Vaaknin had been killed two days before.\nMr. Vaaknin lived in the southern town of Dimona and worked on a farm near Ranana just north of Tel Aviv, a police spokeswoman said. A note from the Islamic Resistance Movement, known as Hamas, was left on the body, she added.\nBefore the signing of the accord, the P.L.O. chairman, Yasir Arafat pledged to call for an end to terrorism and violence. But Hamas, other militant Islamic groups and radical P.L.O. factions vowed to sabotage the accord, which they say is a sellout of the Palestinian cause.\nMr. Vaaknin's body was found hours before Israel sealed itself off from the world for Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, during which Israeli radio and television transmissions and all transportation, including international flights, are halted for 24 hours.\n\nLoad-Date: September 25, 1993"
