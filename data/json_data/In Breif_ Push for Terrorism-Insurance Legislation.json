    "full text": "In the latest effort by politicians to kick-start federal terrorism insurance legislation, Sens. Jack Reed, D-R.I., and Judd Gregg, R-N.H., are collecting signatures on a letter they plan to send today to Senate Majority Leader Thomas Daschle and Minority Leader Trent Lott.\nThe letter urges the leaders to \"bring a terrorism insurance bill to the Senate floor as quickly as possible\" because the high rates and limited coverage for terrorism is having a \"deleterious impact on our economy.\"\nSeparately this week, 18 state governors wrote to congressional leaders asking for action.\nWith insurance companies providing only limited terrorism coverage at high rates, there is a \"grave risk to the solvency of the insurance industry, state insurance facilities, economic development initiatives, and the ability of our states to recover from the impacts of the Sept. 11 attacks,\" the state executives said in the letter dated April 15 and released Wednesday.\nThe governors of Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, South Carolina, Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming, all signed the letter.
