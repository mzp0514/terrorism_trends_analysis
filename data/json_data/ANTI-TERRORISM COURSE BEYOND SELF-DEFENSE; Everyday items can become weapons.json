He shows students how to use hand-to-hand combat techniques and basic, everyday weapons.\nMore than a dozen police officers, marital arts instructors and others attended Dill's anti-terrorist course Saturday at Dees Taekwondo Ltd. in Centerville.\n\"I give a lecture before we start to make sure everyone understands a terrorist is different from a criminal,\" Dill said.\n\"This is not self-defense.\"\nBefore the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Dill focused on martial arts and self-defense courses.\nHe started teaching the anti-terrorist class two weeks after Sept. 11, and travels nearly every weekend demonstrating techniques to law enforcement officers and business executives.\nDill, a Vietnam veteran now of Bartlesville, Okla., studied martial arts for 40 years and holds black belts in several disciplines.\nHe served in the U.S. Navy as a naval intelligence agent, in the Marines and taught courses in firearms and police defensive tactics.\nIn class, Dill is careful to show his students the difference between a move that will hurt and one that will kill. Thumbs, cell phones, airplane blankets and ballpoint pens become deadly weapons. Students learn numerous ways to break a person's neck.\nThe techniques go beyond the standard self-defense course, teaching students to possibly kill, rather than just debilitate, the aggressor.\nTerrorists have long been a threat abroad, Dill said, and U.S. citizens still are adapting to the elevated threat.\n\"People don't want to feel like a helpless victim,\" Dill said. \"Any place can be a target.\"\nContact Shannon Joyce Neal at 225-2436 or sjneal@coxohio.com  \n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTOS, (1) INSTRUCTOR GARY DILL (right) shows those attending his course Saturday how to handle an attacking terrorist.,(2) ROY BARNETT GRABS John Lowe as they practice moves taught by Gary Dill.,CREDIT: PHOTOS BY RON ALVEY/DAYTON DAILY NEWS\n\nLoad-Date: April 22, 2003"
