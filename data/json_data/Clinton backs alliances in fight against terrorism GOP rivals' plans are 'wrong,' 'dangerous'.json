    "full text": "Clinton\nHillary Clinton broadened her critique of Republicans Donald Trump and Ted Cruz and their responses to the terrorist attacks in Brussels, calling them \"wrong\" and \"dangerous\" approaches that would alienate U.S. allies and proliferate the terrorist threat.\nIn a foreign policy address Wednesday at Stanford University, Clinton took aim at both presidential candidates, while also proposing intensified air\nstrikes, more support for Arab and Kurdish ground fighters and greater efforts to apprehend those who enable Islamic State jihadists.\nThe former secretary of State, in rebuking Cruz, said it would be a \"serious mistake to begin carpet bombing civilian areas into oblivion\" in Syria and Iraq and \"treating American Muslims like criminals.\" The Texas senator is proposing stepped-up \"patrols\" of Muslim areas, something Trump said he agreed with.\nClinton also argued that the U.S. must reinforce critical alliances, particularly with NATO. The day before the terrorist strike that killed at least 31 in the heart of the European Union, Trump said the U.S. should rethink its involvement in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Clinton called NATO \"one of the best investments America has ever made\" and cited European solidarity with the U.S. after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. \"Now it's our turn to stand with Europe,\" she said, adding, \"If Mr. Trump gets his way, it'll be like Christmas in the Kremlin.\"\nTrump said the United States was \"taking care\" of Ukraine and \"paying disproportionately\" to major European countries. He later clarified that the U.S. should decrease its spending and not its role.\n\nLoad-Date: March 24, 2016"
