There was shouting. There were angry words and finger pointing.\n\"No hate in Hillsborough,\" one sign read. \"Racist jerks go home,\" said another.\nThe event started out as a quiet anti-CAIR march by school board candidate Terry Kemple. He and about two dozen supporters walked from a Sept. 11 prayer rally at a downtown park to the steps of the school district headquarters a few blocks away, where a news conference was planned.\nThey were met there, however, by a similar-sized group unhappy with the message they have been hearing the past nine months about the Council for American Islamic Relations. The CAIR group has been under fire since its executive director, Hassan Shibly, spoke to a Steinbrenner High School class last year.\nShibly and CAIR have been criticized by Kemple and others as having terrorist ties.\nSamantha Bowden, 24, of Tampa showed up as a \"voice of reason and tolerance\" to counter the Kemple protest.\n\"If Terry Kemple is elected, I truly feel sorry for our students' futures,\" Bowden said. \"The company he keeps is small-minded.\"\nMichael Freincle agreed.\n\"I feel as a Jew, I need to stand up when I see hatred,\" the 25-year-old Brandon resident said. \"They've lost the moral high ground. What this group has a problem with is another religion.\"\nKemple and other supporters of the anti-CAIR movement dismissed any notion of hatred.\n\"This is not anti-Muslim, this is talking about groups with ties to terrorism,\" said Kemple, who is running for a countywide school board seat. \"We want to let the school board know there's more than a few of us who believe that. We want the people in America to wake up.\"\nKemple and others said there was no better day than Sept. 11 to speak out about the threat of CAIR in the classroom.\n\"It's a day of awareness,\" he said.\nHad there been more awareness and discussion 11 years ago, Kemple said, the \"chatter\" that took place before that deadly day might have been picked up on and the calamity prevented.\nSchool board member Stacy White, who has backed Kemple's plan, heard the protests firsthand. He joined Kemple and others who spoke out on the issue about an hour before the school board meeting.\n\"These folks are true patriots,\" White said. \"No one but school staff has an inherent right to be in our classrooms.\"\nDuring the school board meeting, the controversial issue came up only during the public comment section near the end, when three speakers addressed it. The board took no action.\nIn other matters, the board:\nGave final approval to a policy designed to cut down on student transfers for athletic purposes.\nApproved next year's $2.8 billion budget, which calls for slightly lower school property taxes for Hillsborough residents.\nAppointed Julie Hasson as principal of Symmes Elementary. Principal Patrick LaLone of Davis Elementary and Principal Cecilia Troutt of the LaVoy Center are switching positions.\nrshaw@tampatrib.com\n(813) 259-7999\nCopyright Â© 2012, The Tampa Tribune and may not be republished without permission.
