Obama made the comments Saturday during his visit to France.\nThe Bush administration agreed to remove North Korea from the U.S. list of terrorist states after the North said it would dismantle its nuclear weapons facilities. It later refused to go forward with the dismantlement.\nClinton was asked on ABC's \"This Week\" about a letter that some senators wrote Obama about returning North Korea to that list.\n\"We're going to look at it. There's a process for it,\" Clinton said in the interview, taped Thursday in Egypt. \"Obviously we would want to see recent evidence of their support for international terrorism.\"\nShe added, \"We're just beginning to look at it. I don't have an answer for you right now.\"\nNorth Korea, she said, was \"taken off of the list for a purpose and that purpose is being thwarted by their actions.\"\n\nLoad-Date: June 9, 2009"
