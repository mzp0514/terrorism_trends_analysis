    "full text": "Russia and China called Thursday for the United Nations to take the lead in the global fight against terrorism. The nations' leaders spoke on the second day of a U.N. summit.\nThe demands for a bigger U.N. role underlined how central terrorism has become around the world since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\"There is a need to adjust this organization to the new historical reality,\" Russian President Vladimir Putin said. \"Who else will take the role of coordinating and organizing this work but the United Nations?\"\nHe was echoed by Chinese President Hu Jintao, who called for a new global security concept that puts the United Nations at \"the core\" of efforts to fight terrorism and settle disputes and conflicts.\nAlso, a U.N. treaty to fight global corruption got its 30th ratification and will go into effect in 90 days. The convention empowers countries to prosecute officials accused of stealing public funds. \n\"This dream has become a reality,\" said Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of the U.N. Office of Drugs and Crime.\nThis summit was called for two main reasons -- to review progress toward achieving eight goals meant to improve the plight of the world's poor and to consider a raft of proposals to overhaul the U.N. itself.\nMost of the speeches focused on those efforts.\nLeaders generally expressed support for the draft document, which was expected to be adopted today, the summit's last day. But they said they were disappointed that some elements were left out, including Security Council reform and nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation.\nA near constant refrain was that the United Nations should play a larger role in world affairs.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO\n PHOTO - Russian President Vladimir Putin (left) said the United Nations must adjust to \"the new historical reality.\"   His comments were echoed by  Photo - Chinese President Hu Jintao. \n\nLoad-Date: September 17, 2005"
