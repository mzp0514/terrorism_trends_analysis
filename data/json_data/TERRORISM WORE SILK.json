    "full text": "Would this make the Food Network akin to Al Jazeera?\nCelebrity chef Rachael Ray quickly became the target of the right-wing blogosphere and an apparent national security threat after she appeared in an online commercial for Dunkin' Donuts wearing a black-and-white paisley silk scarf.\nThe company pulled the ad after conservative bloggers said the scarf looked like a kaffiyeh, the Middle Eastern headdress used to protect its wearers from sun and sand.\nThe bloggers saw the scarf as a show of support for terrorism. Maybe Ray was trying to signal terrorists waiting in line for donuts and iced coffee. Or maybe Dunkin' Donuts was trying to raise its profile among extremists. Clearly the scarf could not be just a fashion accessory.\nKaffiyehs are commonly worn throughout the Middle East, so automatically linking them with terrorism is, among other things, stupid and racist. Even some U.S. soldiers in Iraq have worn them to keep the sand out of their mouths.\nDunkin' Donuts insisted that it had no ill intentions, but took the ad down because \"Scarf-gate\" was detracting from the promotion of the company's iced coffee. Islamic groups have responded angrily to the move, and the company's reaction is likely to hurt sales in the Middle East.\nAll Americans should be grateful to the right-wing bloggers who have exposed Rachael Ray as the poster girl of kitchen terrorists. Score one for the fruitcakes over the doughnuts.\n\nLoad-Date: June 1, 2008"
