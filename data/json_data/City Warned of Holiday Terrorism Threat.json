    "full text": "Federal law enforcement officials said on Friday that they had issued new warnings to their counterparts in New York and other large American cities about the possibility that terrorists might try to strike during the holiday season.\n     They stressed that intelligence suggesting an attack was fragmentary and that its credibility was in question. \nBut they said they wanted city and state law enforcement agencies to be aware of a recent increase in intercepted electronic communications among people who appear to be associated with Al Qaeda. \n \"The U.S. intelligence community is aware of a reported threat to New York, and we are in the process of determining its credibility,\" said an American intelligence official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \nHe said that fragmentary evidence suggested the possibility that a suicide bomber might try to strike in New York during the holidays. \"But that information is uncorroborated,\" the official said, adding that he did not know the source of the threat.\nThe New York City Police Department released a statement on Friday that it had \"no credible intelligence pointing to a specific or imminent terrorist threat\" in the city. \nOfficials at the Department of Homeland Security in Washington said there were no plans to raise the national color-coded terrorist alert level, now set at yellow, reflecting an \"elevated\" risk. \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: December 20, 2003"
