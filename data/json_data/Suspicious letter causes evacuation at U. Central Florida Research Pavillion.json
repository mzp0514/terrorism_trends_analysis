In some cases, the death penalty can be applied.\nThe FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force is leading the investigation. It is also in charge of the similar incident that occured Monday.\nMoffitt could not disclose any other contents of the mail in question because it is involved in an ongoing investigation.\nDomestic terrorism could include anything that disturbs the community.\nAccording to information from the FBI's Web site, \"JTTFs are teams of state and local law enforcement officers, FBI Agents, and other federal agents and personnel who work shoulder-to-shoulder to investigate and prevent acts of terrorism.\"\n(C) 2008 Central Florida Future via UWIRE\n\nLoad-Date: September 11, 2008"
