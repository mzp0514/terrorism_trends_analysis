    "full text": "William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence, has ordered a review of C.I.A. contracts to develop what he called ''additional protections'' against the transfer of technology and information by former agents to such countries as Libya and the Soviet Union.\nIn the text of an 11-page speech prepared for delivery to the Central Intelligence Agency's employees, Mr. Casey specifically referred to the recent episode in which two former agents, Edwin P.  Wilson and Frank Terpil, used their agency connections to travel to Libya to train terrorists and transport explosives there illegally.\nMr. Casey said that Stanley Sporkin, the C.I.A.'s general counsel, ''is reviewing our contracts to develop additional protections against the kind of moonlighting and use of our contractors and technology which occurred in the Wilson-Terpil situation.''\n \nTries to Reassure Employees\nThe purpose of Mr. Casey's speech was to reassure the agency's employees that he intended to weather the current controversy over his past financial practices and management of the agency, which have led to calls for his resignation by three key Republican Senators, including Barry Goldwater, Republican of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.\nCIA Director William Casey orders reviews of CIA contracts to develop more protections against technology transfers by former agents\nIn the speech, Mr. Casey said he had taken steps to improve the agency's operations and that there would be additional measures.  Asserting that past intelligence estimates had not reflected ''the full range of threats which our policy makers need to protect against,'' he said that he had, on occasion, refused to accept estimates prepared by agency analysts. He said that estimates prepared on Africa and Latin America, specifically, had ''not addressed Soviet interests, activities and influence.''\n \nAssails Intelligence Reports\nIn the past, Mr. Casey said, agency estimates had failed to address these aspects. ''Worse still,'' he continued, ''I have seen drafts of estimates prepared a year or more ago by analysts in this building which accurately predicted what has happened in Nicaragua and Cuba's new aggressive policies in Central America at a time when those developments certainly should have been carefully considered.''\n''Sadly,'' he said, ''these analytical insights were strangled in the clearance and coordinating process so that they did not reach policy makers in a national estimate. I intend to see that that does not happen as long as I am D.C.I.''\nThe speech marks the first acknowledgment by Mr. Casey that he had declined to accept intelligence estimates prepared by the agency's analytical unit. There have been published reports that Mr. Casey, for example, rejected a C.I.A. draft assessment on terrorism that, according to intelligence officials, failed to conclude that the Soviet Union was directly involved in fomenting international terrorism.\nIn his speech, Mr. Casey said he had ''revised timetables and procedures for doing national estimates to get them out more quickly, making them more crisp and more relevant to policy needs.''\n \nHugel Affair Mentioned\nMr. Casey also said he had moved to improve coordination between the intelligence community and policy makers. He said that he and his deputy, Adm. Bobby R. Inman, were now having weekly meetings with Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. and Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger and ''regular meetings'' with President Reagan and the National Security Council.\nSome of Mr. Casey's remarks related to a reorganization of the agency's clandestine operations that led to his original selection of Max C. Hugel as director of clandestine operations. Mr. Hugel resigned two weeks ago after former business associates accused him of misconduct in financial dealings, charges that Mr. Hugel denied.\nMr. Casey acknowledged in the speech that the Hugel episode had ''turned out badly.'' He said there had been ''strong views that someone with more experience should be at the top,'' and he said he had decided that ''the required operational experience'' could be provided by two ''career deputies'' working under Mr. Hugel, whom he identified as John Stein and Clair George. Mr. Stein, a former agent who was Mr.  Hugel's deputy, was named by Mr. Casey to replace Mr. Hugel.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nIllustrations: photo of Intelligence Committee"
