    "full text": "WINNING BACK THE SKY: A Tactical Analysis of Terrorism. By David G. Hubbard. (Saybrook, $14.95.) Today's terrorist is neither Superman nor Satan, says David G. Hubbard in ''Winning Back the Sky,'' a 140-page book that is slim on facts but fat on pronouncements. Dr. Hubbard, a Dallas psychiatrist who says he has interviewed hundreds of skyjackers and terrorists over the last 20 years, is a former consultant to the Federal Avia-tion Administration and author of an earlier book on skyjackers. Dr. Hubbard writes that the first skyjackers were usually personal failures who wanted to stage a dramatic act but were not necessarily great planners.\nThe newer breed, he says, is from the same mold but has often found religion (Islamic fundamentalism is one) and is therefore more treacherous though not invincible. If one is unfortunate enough to end up in a terrorist's hands, one might not want Dr. Hubbard planning a rescue operation. There probably would not be any. He writes, ''To risk a hundred lives of soldiers to save that one is questionable logic; to jeopardize our standing as a world power to save that one life is even more unrealistic,'' One way to attack terrorism is to bash the news media, which Dr. Hubbard does, repeatedly. ''Excessive media coverage,'' he says, ''is almost entirely responsible for creating and perpetuating the 'monster' of terrorism.'' This is not to say that such thoughts should go unexplored. Unfortunately, this book bounces off recent acts of terrorism rather than studying them in any depth. ''Winning Back the Sky'' lacks an index but does have a final note soliciting reader correspondence. Maybe for the next book."
