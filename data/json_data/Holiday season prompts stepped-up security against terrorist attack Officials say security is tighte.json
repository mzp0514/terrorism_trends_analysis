Mr. Abdulmutallab had been in a terror database, and his father had tried to warn officials that the young man might be a danger.\nImprovements over the past year\nAmong other things, according to Mr. Brennan, gaps in analysis and data collection have been closed, the criteria used to create terrorist watch lists and \"no fly\" lists have been revised, some 500 of the controversial \"Advanced Imaging Technology\" scanning machines for passengers have been deployed at more than 75 US airports, and additional steps have been taken to screen cargo shipped by air (or checked by passengers).\n\"We are in a much better position today than we were last year at this time,\" he said.\nExperts on terrorism often point out that security agencies need to prevent all attempted attacks in order to be successful but that terrorists need to succeed just once. Of particular concern is the possibility that a home-grown \"lone wolf\" attacker - seen as expendable to terrorist groups overseas - might be able to avoid detection.\nThis is why the FBI and other law-enforcement agencies increasingly employ sting operations to thwart potential attackers.\nRecent terrorist attempt in Oregon\nMost notably, that includes Mohamed Osman Mohamud, arrested recently for allegedly plotting to explode a bomb at the Pioneer Courthouse Square in Portland, Ore., where thousands of families had gathered for the traditional Christmas tree lighting.\nIn October, a Pakistani-born US citizen was arrested on charges of plotting to carry out a coordinated bombing attack on Metrorail stations in suburban Virginia near Washington.\nEarlier this month, US Attorney General Eric Holder told Muslim Advocates, a San Francisco community group, that sting operations \"have proven to be an essential law-enforcement tool in uncovering and preventing potential terror attacks.\"\nThey may be essential to law enforcement, but they're not infallible, say terrorism experts.\nSooner rather than later?\n\"We haven't had a successful terrorist event, but there's a lot of luck involved in that,\" says Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. \"It's my belief that we are going to have a successful, moderate intensity, significant casualty attack sooner rather than later. Those of us in the monitoring community are completely flummoxed by the fact that it hasn't happened yet.\"\nOfficials base their concern this holiday season on \"increased chatter\" among individuals and organizations associated with terrorism.\n\"There is a lot of chatter in the intel world ... that references the holidays,\" Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano told ABC on Monday. \"We know that things have already happened in Europe, and we're watching that very closely as well.\"\nOn Monday, British police arrested 12 men allegedly in the final stages of a major bomb plot. Those arrested - in their teens and 20s - were mostly British citizens. Some are of Bangladeshi origin.\n\"We're not going to bat 1,000 necessarily,\" Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told ABC. \"We can't guarantee that. But we're certainly doing everything we can to ensure that we do thwart any kind of an attack.\"\nIN PICTURES: American Jihadis\n       \n\nLoad-Date: December 28, 2010"
