    "full text": "To the Editor:\nIn his bizarre letter of May 28, Representative Connie Mack wonders ''by whose definition'' must the U.S.-supported contra war against Nicaragua be characterized as ''terrorism.'' That's an easy question.\nHere is a definition published by the U.S. Department of State: ''Terrorism is premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine state agents.''\nThere is no reasonable doubt that this accurately fits the contra forces in Nicaragua. Independent observers report that the contras have ''routinely attacked civilian populations,'' that ''their forces kidnap, torture and murder health workers, teachers and other government employees.'' This quote is from the human-rights organization Americas Watch, but many others report the same things.\nUsing our Government's own definition, then, the counterrevolutionaries who have killed thousands of Nicaraguans, including babies, children and old people, and who murdered U.S. citizen Benjamin Linder, are terrorists.\nI hope Representative Mack and other Administration supporters find these facts troubling. If it is painful for them to be identified, accurately, as accomplices to terrorism and murder, perhaps they will join in trying to set this country on a better course.\n \n JOHN LAMPERTI\n   Hanover, N.H., May 28, 1987"
