    "full text": "TO THE EDITOR:\nI am a Democrat, but I am upset with the negative partisan attacks by Democrats unwilling to credit Republican administrations for any positive achievements.\nWe need a spirit of unity as a nation.\n#KOSMELA.LIB#We need to look for ways we can work together to fight the war on terrorism - not look for issues to criticize and divide. We do not want to fight terror in our back yard.\nWhen President Clinton took office and the economy improved, Democrats were quick to take credit and criticize 12 years of Republican administrations. It takes several years for new economic policies to have a substantial long-term effect. Clinton should get no more credit for improving the economy &tstr; it was already improving and on an upswing when he took office.\nBoth Republicans and Democrats must work together to tackle the problems of job-loss overseas and unfair trade agreements like NAFTA.\nWe also must work together to tackle the problem of terrorism. It is clear fighting terrorism was not a high enough priority of the Clinton administration.\nHow can we listen to Richard Clarke who did little for eight years? What good can come of second-guessing what Bush's priorities were?  Lou Kosmela, Lancaster\n\nLoad-Date: August 20, 2004"
