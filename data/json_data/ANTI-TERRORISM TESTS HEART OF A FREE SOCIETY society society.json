    "full text": "WASHINGTON (AP) - Terrorists based in the Middle East or elsewhere\nwill someday almost certainly use chemical, biological and possibly\nnuclear weapons of mass destruction against U.S. targets, the CIA and\nFBI say.\nMany of these same suspected terrorists today roam U.S. streets,\ncommunicate through U.S. Internet sites or send U.S. dollars to their\ncells overseas.\nCan't anything be done?\nYes, and some things are. The military has improved technology to to to\ndetect the threats. Experts are training emergency personnel to\nprevent deaths. The FBI's counter-terrorist staff has been beefed up.\nCongress has enacted laws to crack down on visas and finances.\nBut there are no easy technological fixes. And the legal solutions\nalmost inevitably run up against the Constitution and the core values\nof a society that treasures its freedom.\nLast month, the Pentagon launched the $ 46.5 million Chem-Bio Quick\nResponse Force aimed at training police, doctors and fire officials in\n120 cities to react to attacks by weapons of mass destruction.\n\"The first responders in this country are not prepared to handle a\nterrorist attack - we just aren't there,\" says Robert Canfield, a\nblunt-talking former Massachusetts state police official who now\nconsults on emergency planning with federal and local agencies.\nEmergency exercise results support Canfield.\nThe first 100 emergency workers to arrive on the scene of a 1995 New\nYork City exercise were \"killed\" because they were unprepared to deal\nwith the toxins, according to a Senate report. In a similar exercise\nin Los Angeles, doctors conceded defeat after discovering their\nhospitals \"would have become hopelessly contaminated by the injured\npatients.\"\nThe U.S. military has an alphabet soup of units - NEST, TEU, SOC -\nslated to be first on the scene of a chemical or biological attack.\nThe Army's Technical Escort Unit stationed in Aberdeen, Md., boasts\nequipment that can detect 75,000 compounds.\nBut a congressional report found the Aberdeen unit \"lacks the depth\nand robustness to maintain the readiness status expected of this\nunique national capability.\"\nAnd an internal Pentagon study said that, in many cases, the vital\ndetectors used by such units are one-of-a-kind instruments.\nFalse alarm?\nAs the U.S. military discovered in the gulf war, spreading detectors\naround preventively has its limitations. Many alarms were false, and\nsome accurate readings were apparently ignored. Such failures could be\ndisastrous in a civilian society.\n\"What happens when a detector goes off in the New York City subway and\nit's a false alarm?\" asks Maj. Gen. George Friel, head of the U.S.\nArmy Chemical and Biological Defense Command.\nThere are other technical - and human - limitations to what can be\ndone to stop terrorist attacks before they occur.\nSan Jose International Airport uses state-of-the-art baggage X-ray\nmachines for boarding passengers. But twice in March, slow-acting\nsecurity guards allowed passengers to pick up carry-on bags even thou\ngh the machine showed a gun inside. One case turned out to be a\nchild's toy. Guards and police failed to find the second gun, which\npresumably flew to its destination on a commercial airliner.\nFBI Director Louis Freeh has warned of another danger - virtually\nunbreakable security programs that protect terrorist computer files.\nIt took a year to decode some of the files of Ramzi Yousef, the World\nTrade Center bomber.\nAside from the technical problems, terrorism-battling proposals such\nas the Pentagon's new Chem-Bio Quick Response Force also raise\ntroubling constitutional issues.\nBright line\nFrom its birth, the United States has drawn a bright line between the\nmilitary and police.\n\"We think it is a very dangerous idea involving the military in law\nenforcement,\" says Louis Bogard of the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\"Countries where the military serves in civil police enforcement have\ntraditionally been the most repressive regimes in the world.\"\nSimilar constitutional issues arise in the flurry of anti-terrorist\nlaws and regulations adopted in the wake of the 1993 World Trade\nCenter attack and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.\nIn January 1995, President Clinton signed an executive order freezing\n$ 800,000 in the accounts of Middle East terrorist groups undermining\nthe U.S.-brokered peace process. The effectiveness was questionable,\nsince few terrorists openly label their accounts \"Hezbollah\" or\n\"Islamic Jihad.\"\nBut the president's order troubles civil libertarians.\nBefore Nelson Mandela became president of South Africa, his\nanti-apartheid group, the African National Congress, was officially\nlisted as a terrorist organization, notes David Cole, a law professor\nat Georgetown University.\n\"If the law was in place a few years ago, thousands of Americans would\nhave faced prison terms for giving to the African National Congress,\"\nhe says.\nThe president not only froze bank accounts, he also effectively\nchilled the right to free speech for many Muslims in the United\nStates, says Muhammad Mehdi, head of the National Council of Islamic\nAffairs.\n\"People felt they were being watched, and they should not talk about\ntheir views,\" Mehdi said. \"The freedom of speech is the most precious\nthing they have, not the money they don't have.\"\nWhile some worry about abuses, others say the FBI and local police are\nhobbled by restrictions left over from the 1970s domestic spying\nscandals.\nThe FBI is barred from collecting information on people or\norganizations not yet suspected of any specific crime, notes John\nO'Neill, former head of the FBI's counter-terrorism office.\n\"I can't even keep a newspaper clip about a subject in my office if I\ndon't have an active case,\" O'Neill says.\nOther limits\nThere are other limitations. The FBI has few Arabic-speaking agents.\nMounds of documents seized from an institute at the University of\nSouth Florida that have possible connections to Islamic Jihad still\nawait translation.\nMore ominously, the FBI failed to translate the documents found in the\nBrooklyn apartment of an Islamic militant arrested in the 1990\nshooting of Jewish Defense League founder Meir Kahane. Only after the\nsuspect, El-Sayyid Nosair, was linked to the 1993 World Trade Center\nbombing did the FBI go back to those papers and find a chilling call\nfor the destruction of \"the towers of the West.\"\nBut things are changing. Congress has approved and the president has\nsigned laws to increase FBI and CIA cooperation, notes Victoria\nToensing, head of anti-terrorism efforts in the attorney general's\noffice under President Bush.\nShe cautions, however, that the FBI and CIA have different,\npotentially conflicting missions.\n\"The FBI has to bring a case to trial - their information will\neventually be made public,\" she says. \"But at the CIA, you're going to\nfind people who are still protecting their sources. The CIA is afraid\nof a public trial.\" trial.\" trial.\"\n\nLoad-Date: May 28, 1997"
