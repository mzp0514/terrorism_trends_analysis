Police and fire officials from the county had to restrain the terrorists as well as protect a hostage.\nA successful response must include police and firefighters working together, which can sometimes be problematic, Young said.\n\"Police always try to keep the crime scene clear, but you can't do that if you have a hundred firemen running around,\" he said.\n\"Allowing these people to learn how to work with each other to accomplish their goals is why we did the drill.\"\nEmergency responders were not given the details of the drill beforehand.\n\"We try to keep it as real as possible,\" said Jerry Lautz, who is the southwest Ohio regional coordinator for Terrorism Preparedness and served as a controller for the event. \"That way you get a true response to it.\"\nLautz has been involved in about a dozen similar drills.\nThe drill tested the existing emergency procedures as well as the flexibility of the emergency workers.\nLautz, who has been involved in about a dozen drills, said the drills are encouraging.\n\"(Responders) usually remember the emergency responses very well,\" he said.\nSimilar drills have been run in Hamilton and Butler counties, said Young, who said he thought the simulation was successful.\n\"A well-oiled machine operates better,\" Young said.\n\nLoad-Date: July 12, 2003"
