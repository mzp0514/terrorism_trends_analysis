    "full text": "NEW YORK -- President Clinton, speaking at the United Nations\ntoday, will call on countries around the world to act on a \"common\nobligation\" to battle terrorism.\nIn the annual opening address to the General Assembly, Clinton\nwill repeat his call to tighten international banking controls,\nstrengthen extradition laws and improve airport security.\nWhite House officials describe the speech as a major appeal to\nother countries to join in the campaign against terrorism.\nIt comes a month after Clinton launched military strikes in retaliation\nfor embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania that were linked to\nIslamic fundamentalists.\nIn the speech, he notes the growing number of Muslims in the United\nStates and denies there is any religious justification for Islamic\nfundamentalists' attacks on Americans.\nThe United States has more than 1,200 mosques and Islamic centers\nand 6 million Muslims, Clinton says. He calls for stronger ties,\nnot violent conflict, with Islamic nations.\nBut as Clinton steps to the rostrum at 10:45 a.m., his message\nis likely to be overshadowed by the broadcast of his videotaped\ngrand jury testimony to special counsel Ken Starr.\nIn the U.N. speech, Clinton will say, \"When it comes to terrorism,\nthere should be no dividing line between Moslems and Jews, Protestants\nand Catholics, Serbs and Albanians, developed societies and emerging\neconomies.\n\"The only dividing line is between those who practice, support\nor tolerate terror and those who understand that terrorism is\n. . . murder.\"\n\nLoad-Date: September 21, 1998"
