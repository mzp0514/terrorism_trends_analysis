    "full text": "13153 Terrell Ridge\nLiberal extremists, who embrace communism and coddle the destructive behavior of abortionists, degenerates, criminals and terrorists, are consumed with hatred for President Bush and contempt for national unity, patriotism and traditional family values.\nThey lie or distort facts to drive opinion polls, influence elections and rile an undiscerning public against their enemy, American Christians and conservatives.\nUnfortunately, civility and national security mean nothing to partisan liberals, who scheme for power and control and the destruction of Bush in a ridiculous \"get-even\" plan to impeach him after the elections.\nMeanwhile, the world and this nation are increasingly threatened by the evil of terrorism and nuclear destruction threatens our very existence. But Democrats' only solution is to downplay terrorism, undermine our military, malign our president and distract the country with unbelievable pettiness.\nLiberals sow division, rebellion and strife and demand we surrender to terrorists who are emboldened by their defeatist rhetoric. Islamic fascists repeat their treasonous propaganda to escalate the war, recruit more terrorists and hasten America's annihilation while laughing at our emasculation.\nChronically unhappy liberals rage against Bush despite our security, tremendous national economy, declining federal deficit and lowest unemployment in decades, all unreported by the never \"fair and balanced\" liberal media.\nThis deception provokes hate in blind adherents, who inconceivably want to assassinate Bush and oust the less corrupt in favor of worse politicians. Trusting instead liberals, who offer no hope, no direction and no core values, but know how to defame rivals and plunder supporters with heavier tax burdens.\n\nLoad-Date: October 27, 2006"
