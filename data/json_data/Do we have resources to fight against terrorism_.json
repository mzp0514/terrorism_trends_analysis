Limbaugh's opinion that we'll begin the reverting back to politics as usual by the end of September.\nIn the meantime, while we are still emotionally charged, let us ask ourselves one important question. Since it is the federal government's main job to provide for the defense of our country, doesn't Bill Clinton deserve the same punishment, for cutting our military and rejecting improved airport security recommended to him and thereby inviting attack, as we have in store for Osama bin Laden?\nMichael J. Reach\nLancaster\n\nLoad-Date: September 20, 2001"
