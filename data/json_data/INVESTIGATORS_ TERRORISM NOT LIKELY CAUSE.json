    "full text": "Terrorism probably was not involved in the Swissair crash in Canada, U.S. authorities said yesterday as American investigators joined in a search for the cause.\nAmong the 229 who died when Flight SR111 plunged into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Nova Scotia were 136 American passengers and one U.S. crew member from Delta Airlines.\nThe Clinton administration, nervous about possible retaliation against U.S. targets following missile strikes on suspected terrorist facilities in Afghanistan and Sudan, was quick to discount the likelihood of such a cause for the crash.\n\"We have no indication that terrorism was involved,\" said P.J. Crowley, a White House spokesman in Northern Ireland with President Clinton, who was being kept advised of developments.\nAttorney General Janet Reno said \"all initial information indicates that it was an accident.\"\nFBI Director Louis Freeh was more noncommittal, telling a Senate Judiciary subcommittee his agency was examining passenger manifests from the plane.\n\"A lot of things are being done at the [New York] airport to secure what could be evidence or information that is required to make decisions,\" he said. \"We don't have any indication at this point what caused that tragedy.\"\n\nLoad-Date: October 17, 2002"
