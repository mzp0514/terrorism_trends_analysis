    "full text": "April 20--The interrelationship between tourism and terrorism and how people can protect themselves will be discussed by Peter Tarlow, director of the Center for Latino-Jewish Relations and president of Tourism & More, during a special John Ben Shepperd Leadership Roundup on Thursday.\nThe lecture, titled \"Terrorism: How It Will Affect Your Future,\" is scheduled for 6 p.m. Thursday in room LL001 of the Library Lecture Hall at the University of Texas of the Permian Basin. Bob Brescia, executive director of the John Ben Shepperd Public Leadership Institute, will moderate.\nIn his presentation, Tarlow will examine the correlation between tourism and terrorism, why terrorists tend to target tourist areas, a little bit about what people can do to protect themselves and what the tourism industry can do to protect tourists.\nBeing a rabbi and becoming a terrorism and tourism expert may not seem to go together, but Tarlow noted there is a concept in the Jewish faith called a mitzvah, or a good deed.\n\"The most important godly deed we can do is save someone's life,\" Tarlow said. Paraphrasing a quote from the Talmud, he said, he who saves a life, it's as if he's saved an entire world and he who destroys a life, it's as if he destroyed an entire world.\n\"That's where I bring the Jewish part and the anti-terrorism part together,\" Tarlow said.\nTo read the rest of this story, become a subscriber to the premium news website myoaoa.com.\nRuth Campbell covers education for the Odessa American.
