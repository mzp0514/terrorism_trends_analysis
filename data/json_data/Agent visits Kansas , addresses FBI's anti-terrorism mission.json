    "full text": "Adam Angst is not your stereotypical Federal Bureau of Investigation agent. But then again, no agent is, he said.\nAngst, a former Abilene, Kan., resident and Riley County Police Department officer, spoke Monday evening at the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library and Museum auditorium about his job and the FBI's role in combating terrorism.\n\"Hollywood has stereotyped FBI agents and their relations with law enforcement,\" he said. \"These misperceptions can be dangerous.\"\nAngst used humor to relay his points to the audience, with frequent clips from movies like \"Men in Black.\"\n\"I'm not a terrorism expert, because the subject is too vast,\" he said. \"I spent three months in Afghanistan, and my little boy thinks I'm not a very good agent because I didn't come back with Osama bin Laden.\"\nAccording to the FBI, terrorism is \"the unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to coerce a government or its citizens to further certain political or social objectives.\"\nAngst elaborated on the definition, saying a person can terrorize without being a terrorist. In order to be a terrorist, he or she must have a political agenda.\nThere is confusion about the FBI's role in the Department of Homeland Security, but Angst said the FBI is not part of that department, since it belongs to the Department of Justice.\n\"Homeland security protects borders, and the FBI hunts the terrorists down,\" Angst said.\nThe mission of the FBI is to prevent, disrupt and defeat terrorist attacks before they occur, and Angst said the bureau definitely is doing its job, as it has thwarted more than 100 terrorist attacks since Sept. 11, 2001.\nHe also spoke about the two types of terrorism: domestic and international.\n\"Domestic terrorism is often overlooked,\" Angst said. \"It's home-grown Americans throwing the flag out the window. The attacks that we've managed to avoid since 9/11 have been international, not domestic.\n\"The Constitution gives everyone the right to dislike the government, but the second you pick up a bat and force others to believe the same, you become a domestic terrorist.\"\nAngst said the biggest threats to the U.S. are Islamic fundamentalists with extremist views, also known as fanatics. He mentioned numerous terrorist attacks in the United States and expressed his fear for the future.\n\"America is starting to falter in its resolve,\" he said. \"It's easy to remember what happened in New York and Washington D.C., today on this anniversary, but I think we all just want to put it behind us and forget.\n\"I could tell you that because of what the FBI and other organizations have done, we'll have no more days like that one, but I can't promise that. There are more days coming, and we need to stand strong in our resolve.\"\nAngst played a movie montage to remind the audience of the events of Sept. 11, 2001. He said he believes the U.S. cannot win this war, and life will never go back to the way it was.\n\"It's not a traditional battlefield anymore; it's a lifestyle,\" he said.\nEd Aldrine, Topeka, Kan., resident, said his career in law enforcement brought him to hear Angst speak.\n\"I thought it was very well-formatted and excellently put together,\" Aldrine said. \"I enjoyed the speech because it was obvious the thought and care put into it.\"\nDan Holt, director of the Eisenhower Library, introduced Angst to the audience, saying it is important the public is informed and updated about the threat of terrorism.\n\"The world faces terrorism on a daily basis,\" Holt said. \"We, as individuals, need to do whatever we can to combat this threat.\"\n(C) 2006 Kansas State Collegian via U-WIRE\n\nLoad-Date: September 12, 2006"
