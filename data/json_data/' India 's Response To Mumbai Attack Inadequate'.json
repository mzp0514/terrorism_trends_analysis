He observed that creation of the NIA is important, but post-Mumbai attacks, it does not help India with its perennial problem in terms of prevention.\n\"They still have to create something like the equivalent of NCTC. They have not done that yet,\" Tellis said. Indian officials, he said, are still struggling with the issue of classification.\nHe warned that despite better preventive and response systems in the U.S., a Mumbai-like attack on America by the Islamic terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) was \"not inconceivable.\"\nHe asserted that it would be a gross error to treat the terrorism facing India--including the terrible Mumbai terrorist attack allegedly by Pakistani nationals with links to the LeT--as simply a problem for New Delhi alone.\nIn a very real sense, the outage in Mumbai was fundamentally a species of global terrorism not merely because the assailants happened to believe in an obscurantist brand of Islam but, more importantly, because killing Indians turned out to be simply interchangeable with killing citizens of some 15 different nationalities for no apparent reason whatsoever, Tellis added.\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\nCopyright(c) 2009 RealTimeTraders.com, Inc.
