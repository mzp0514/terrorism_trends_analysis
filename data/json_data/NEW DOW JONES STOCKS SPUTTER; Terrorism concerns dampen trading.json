    "full text": "The Dow Jones industrial average didn't get much help Thursday from its three new stocks on their first day in the historic index - but then it didn't get much help from the other 27 either.\nDisappointing corporate news and concern about terrorism in advance of a three-day holiday weekend dampened the market, leaving all the major indexes down slightly for the week.\nAmerican International Group, an insurance company, was the only winner among the three new Dow stocks, trading at a 52-week high of $76.97 before closing at $76.27 with a gain of 2 cents.\nPfizer, the drug company, fell 7 cents to $35.60, and Verizon Communications, the phone company, was unchanged at $37.31.\nThe three former Dow stocks did even worse, all declining: telecom giant AT&T by 29 cents to $19.23; photo equipment supplier Eastman Kodak by 5 cents to $25.44; and paper products producer International Paper by 39 cents to $42.01.\nDow Jones & Co., which owns the 108-year-old index, announced the change in membership last week. It's the first such swap since 1999 and was designed, the company said, to bring the index more in line with overall market and economic trends.\nThe Dow was hurt especially by Wal-Mart Stores, which announced that its revenue growth is expected to slow during April. Wal-Mart shares fell $1.29, or 2.2 percent, to $56.69.\n\nLoad-Date: April 10, 2004"
