The drill was to put that training into practice.\n Cass County is not alone. Bismarck agencies also have practiced disaster scenarios, and 30 officials from across North Dakota have been trained to teach people they work with how to handle catastrophic situations, said Doug Friez, director of the state Division of Emergency Management.\n 'At the state level, and certainly at most local governments, there are procedures that have been established in terms of initial response to these sort of things,' Friez said.\n He cautioned that the training does not reflect any known threat. 'We want to reassure people that we're prepared' without raising false fears of any real risk, he said.\n 'Being ready for war is a difficult thing,' he said.\n McDonald said federal grants aimed to encourage terrorism-response training will cover the $ 12,000 cost of the Fargo drill when it is rescheduled.\n The canceled scenario: An explosion releases poison at the Fargodome.\n The Fargo Fire Department would likely be the first agency on the scene and would be in control until the fire is out and the last injured person is removed from the building. Then control shifts to law enforcement agencies, as the disaster becomes a crime scene, McDonald said.\n A hazardous-material team that serves Fargo and neighboring Moorhead, Minn., has devices to detect and clear poison, McDonald said.\n The Air National Guard has similar devices and planned to participate in the drill, Master Sgt. David Somdahl said.\n The terrorism drill would not be the only disaster response practiced. Hoover said airports are required to hold regular drills with emergency workers on how to respond to plane crashes.\n In the number of people and agencies involved, however, the canceled event 'probably would have been the biggest drill done in the area,' Hoover said.\n Somdahl said the drill prepares for a scenario that appears more realistic than it was one week ago.\n 'I never anticipated thousands of people dying in the middle of Manhattan,' he said. 'But it has happened.'\n\nLoad-Date: September 17, 2001"
