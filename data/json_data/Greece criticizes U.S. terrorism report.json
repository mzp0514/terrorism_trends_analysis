    "full text": "ATHENS -- Greece said Monday a U.S. congressional report condemning its record on fighting terrorism was unrealistic and anti-Greek.\n\"The report's content bears no relation to reality,\" government spokesman Dimitris Reppas told reporters.\nThe report by the National Commission on Terrorism is said to classify Greece as \"not fully cooperating\" against terrorism, and could in theory draw sanctions such as barring Athens from buying U.S. weapons.\nThe commission was set up by the U.S. Congress two years ago in response to the bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa.\nThe report, leaked by the Washington Post and due for release later Monday, suggests sanctions against friendly states Greece and Pakistan.\n\"Those who come up with and publish such reports view matters through anti-Greek glasses and offer a very negative service,\" Reppas said. \"Officially, the U.S. government does not adopt this position.\"\nSecretary of State Madeleine Albright said Sunday that the United States would not impose sanctions on the two countries, despite terrorism concerns.\n\"We're pressing them on terrorism,\" she told CNN. \"But we are not considering sanctions.\"\nWashington has often complained to Athens about its failure to arrest or convict any suspects in several guerrilla attacks against U.S. or Greek targets in recent years.\nGreece's most deadly guerrilla group, November 17, emerged in 1975 with the killing of the CIA station chief in Athens and has operated with impunity since.\nA police cooperation pact between the two countries that was due to be signed during President Bill Clinton's trip to Athens in November was set aside mainly because of leftist protests against the visit, Western diplomats said.\n\nLoad-Date: June 5, 2000"
