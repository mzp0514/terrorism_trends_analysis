The video was spotted by Vocativ deep Web analysts on the social media service Telegram, which is reportedly used by the Islamic State. \nThe extremist group says it’s responding to growing efforts by Facebook and Twitter to suspend accounts and remove posts that they say incite violence and promote terrorism. \nThe video shows hackers changing profiles and posting Islamic State propaganda. They allege they have hacked more than 10,000 Facebook accounts, more than 150 Facebook groups and more than 5,000 Twitter profiles. \nSons of the Caliphate is a small offshoot of the Cyber Caliphate that analysts speculate is an “apprentice” division. \nTwitter declined to comment. Facebook could not be reached for comment. \nInternet companies are under growing pressure to more effectively police the presence of the extremist group in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris and in San Bernardino County, Calif. \nTwitter said this month that it suspended 125,000 accounts connected to the Islamic State, or ISIL, over the past six months. \nThis is not the first time ISILlinked groups have made such threats. \nAfter Twitter began cracking down on terrorists in 2014, then-CEO Dick Costolo told Vanity Fair that ISIL fighters threatened to “assassinate” him and other Twitter employees.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nEPA\">Twitter CEO Jack DorseyUSA TODAY\">Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\n\nLoad-Date: November 30, 2023"
