    "full text": "ISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN - Suspected militants attacked and set fire to about 20 tankers carrying oil for NATO and U.S. troops in Afghanistan today, the third such strike inside Pakistan in as many days, police said.\nThe attack took place on a supply line that has been closed by Pakistani authorities in protest of a NATO helicopter attack that killed three Pakistani troops on the border last week.\nThe attack on the tankers will raise the stakes in the closure, which has exacerbated tension between Washington and Islamabad but has been welcomed by Islamist groups opposed to Pakistan's support of the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan.\nPolice officer Umer Hayat said three people were killed and blamed today's attack on \"terrorists.\"\nThe trucks were en route or waiting to travel to the Torkham border crossing along the fabled Khyber Pass, which is used to bring fuel, military vehicles, spare parts, clothing and other nonlethal supplies for foreign troops in Afghanistan.\nPakistan's other main route into landlocked Afghanistan, in Chaman in the southwest, has remained open. Although NATO and the United States have alternative supply routes into Afghanistan, the Pakistani ones are the cheapest and most convenient. Most of the coalition's nonlethal supplies are transported over Pakistani soil from the port city of Karachi.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n GRAPHIC - U.S. MILITARY WAR DEATHS | AP \n\nLoad-Date: October 5, 2010"
