Maybe they'll stop a few more people.\nHolshouser doesn't believe that's enough to stop terrorists. He wants to train local first responders and anyone who is interested to think like a terrorist.\nNew courses at Lamar Institute of Technology, which kick off in April, will teach students about terrorism, counterintelligence and weapons of mass destruction, among other topics.\nStudents can take nine classes in one subject area to earn a certificate.\nEach of five programs contains 12 courses, for a total of 60 courses. Students can take any of the $ 75 courses, but to earn a certificate they must complete nine courses in one program area. A final general program also is offered.\nThe five programs are Understanding and Combating Terrorism; Investigating, Preventing and Surviving Terrorists for Law Enforcement; Homeland Security Intelligence Operations for Law Enforcement; Weapons of Mass Destruction: Anticipation, Preparation and Prevention for First Responders; and Emergency Management.\nOne eight-hour course will be offered on Saturdays. Each course will be offered about once each year and the courses in each program will be offered about once every five weeks.\nHolshouser hopes the courses attract about 100 people each Saturday.\n\"These 60 courses are really teasers,\" Holshouser said. \"Eight hours on a topic will not make you an expert.\"\nHolshouser hopes the program continues to grow. By fall, he hopes LIT will offer an associate degree in homeland security. Students will take eight weeks of each course by computer and then meet for eight hours on a Saturday, Holshouser said.\nFarther down the road, he hopes LIT and Lamar University will hook up to offer bachelor's and graduate degrees in homeland security.\nThe National Institute of Technology in San Jose, Calif., already offers a homeland security program. Sandia National Laboratory and Monterey's Naval Postgraduate School offer master's degree programs in homeland security.\nHolshouser also believes other community colleges throughout the state will adopt the LIT curriculum. He would not say what schools were examining the program.\nWhen other colleges adopt it, people can drive to different locations to complete their hours quickly, Holshouser said.\nTrained law enforcers will teach the courses, said Holshouser, a former U.S. Army intelligence officer. Some instructors, located all over the nation, will fly into Southeast Texas to teach the courses.\nHolshouser expects firefighters, law enforcement officers and health-care workers to take courses through LIT. He hopes members of the community jump in as well.\nHolshouser, who also will teach, said many of the courses will be hands-on rather than \"death by Power Point.\"\nStudent in the document fraud class will handle identification tags when looking for clues of fraud. In the explosives class, they will examine explosives so they can recognize them.\nHolshouser believes Beaumont is a great spot to start the program. In Southeast Texas, there are big-value oil refineries, correctional facilities and ports all potential targets of a terrorist attack, he said.\n-----\nTo see more of The Beaumont Enterprise, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.southeasttexaslive.com \n\nLoad-Date: March 13, 2003"
