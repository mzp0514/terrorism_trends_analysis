    "full text": "Several years ago I attended an exhibit of Rob Rogers' work at a small gallery in Shadyside. There, I had an opportunity to meet him and thank him for what I personally considered one of the funniest cartoons I'd ever seen. Today I have to write in some sense of disappointment for one of the most pathetic, which ran yesterday.\nThe inane comparison of our use of the atomic bomb to end the war in the Pacific with terrorism is a sad reflection of the tragic state of education in this country, and more importantly the collective short attention span of the society we've become. Anyone with even the most basic grasp of history (or the combination of the ability to read and a little initiative) knows that comparing cowardly, modern-day terrorism to nation-states at war is specious at best and idiotic at worst.\n The debate over the propriety of the use of the atom bomb will continue forever. There is no shortage of firsthand accounts of the events in the Pacific war that demonstrate quite clearly the horror that awaited both the allies and the Japanese people in a continued conventional war. One need only complete the Herculean task of getting a library card to actually learn and understand this.\n In the name of all that is holy, people, crack open a damn book once in a while. I shudder to think of the number of people whose opinions are influenced by the inanity of a cartoon like this.\n I will continue to enjoy and appreciate Mr. Rogers' talent and sense of humor, but I wonder if the myopic and naive nature of yesterday's cartoon is not more an embarrassing indictment of the intelligence of the editorial staff at the PG.\n\nLoad-Date: August 11, 2005"
