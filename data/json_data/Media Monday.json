Us?: \"Well, first of all, (President Obama's) a fascinating life story. ... But, you know, don't confuse attention with love. I mean, here is a new president who has promulgated one huge, ambitious program after another. So, of course, he gets a lot of big, page-one headlines. But I don't think, at least up until now, it's been unskeptical or uncritical.\" \n-- New York Times Executive Editor Bill Keller on ABC's \"This Week.\"  \nToo liberal for Moyers: \"I can tell you this is the kind of Valentine every White House press secretary yearns to hand the boss. And it's not all that hard to achieve, because many of our watchdogs are as housebroken as Bo the White House puppy.\" \n-- PBS' Bill Moyers, referring to NBC News' prime-time special \"Inside the Obama White House.\" \nTutorial on terrorism: \"Many people in America believe that the reason there is terrorism is because extremists hate the way Americans live. It's never connected to the Palestinian/Israeli situation. They believe it's cultural. But, perhaps, if they understood the link to the Palestinian/Israeli situation, they might understand terrorism differently.\" \n-- ABC's Chris Cuomo to Gamal Mubarak, son of the  Egyptian president, on \"Good Morning America.\" \n\nLoad-Date: June 29, 2009"
