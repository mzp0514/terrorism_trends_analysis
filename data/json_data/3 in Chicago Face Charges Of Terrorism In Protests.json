    "full text": "CHICAGO -- Tensions were increasing here on Saturday, the eve of a NATO summit meeting, after three men were accused of planning attacks on President Obama's re-election campaign headquarters, the house of Mayor Rahm Emanuel, police stations and financial institutions in downtown Chicago, according to prosecutors.\nThe men, who were among thousands of people from out of town who traveled to Chicago for a weekend of NATO-related protests, were charged with criminal acts relating to terrorism, conspiracy to commit terrorism, and possession of explosives. Bond for the three men -- Jared Chase, 27, of Keene, N.H.; Brent Betterly, 24, of Oakland Park, Fla.; and Brian Jacob Church, 22, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla. -- was set at $1.5 million each. The state's attorney, Anita Alvarez, said that this was the first time she knew of that defendants had been charged under the state's antiterrorism statute. She declined to comment on possible federal charges.\nDuring a news conference on Saturday, officials said that there was no imminent threat to the city, describing the defendants as self-identifying anarchists.\n''The individuals we charged are not peaceful protesters, they are domestic terrorists,'' Ms. Alvarez said. ''The charges we bring today are not indicative of a protest movement that has been targeted.''\nBut lawyers for the defendants and many demonstrators who have been marching in the streets here claim that the arrests are an effort to scare the thousands of people who are expected to protest while world leaders are in town for the meeting on Sunday and Monday.\n''This is just propaganda to create a climate of fear and to create this public perception that protesters are violent,'' said Michael Deutsch, a lawyer with the National Lawyers Guild, which is providing legal advice and representation to protesters during the summit meeting protests.\nBen LaBolt, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, declined to comment and referred questions to the Chicago Police Department.\nAccording to prosecutors, an investigation into the defendants' plans began in early May. Nine people were detained on Wednesday night, when police officers and F.B.I. agents obtained a no-knock search warrant and raided an apartment in Bridgeport, a neighborhood on Chicago's South Side.\nThe three defendants, prosecutors said, had already assembled four Molotov cocktails from empty beer bottles, with cut bandannas as fuses. The Molotov cocktails were to be used in attacks against police stations, which would divert attention from other attacks around the city, they said.\nThe defendants also had plans to buy several assault rifles and build a pipe bomb at the time of their arrests, prosecutors said. Throwing stars, swords with brass-knuckle handles, a hunting bow, a shield with protruding nails, gas masks and a map with details of escape routes from the city were also said to have been found in the apartment.\nBut lawyers for the defendants said that it was a case of entrapment, and that a man and a woman who were either informants or undercover law enforcement officials had come up with the plans and provided the materials for explosives.\nAccording to a statement, the National Lawyers Guild also believes that police officers, who broke down the doors of the apartment with their weapons drawn, did not have a search warrant or consent.\n''They raided my home illegally to intimidate us, and to stop us from doing the important stuff that we're doing,'' Zoe Sigman, a resident of the apartment that was raided, said during a ''solidarity march'' for the defendants here on Saturday.\nUntil Saturday, police had declined to comment or even confirm that arrests had been made, citing a continuing investigation.\nChicago has long been bracing for a weekend of political protests, and by Saturday, at least 16 people had been charged with crimes since Monday. A mass ''anti-NATO'' march that is planned for downtown on Sunday is expected to attract the largest crowd.\nEven as prosecutors announced the new charges on Saturday, several hundred protesters gathered in Mr. Emanuel's neighborhood for a march to his North Side family home.\nThe demonstrators, some wearing hospital gowns and carrying signs that read ''Health Care Not Warfare,'' planned the march to raise awareness about clinics that had been closed and to stress the need for strong mental health services for veterans.\n''The fact that our society continues to spend for the war in an age when people are told they're going to be losing lifesaving services shows our priorities are completely skewed,'' said Matt Ginsberg-Jaeckle, one of the organizers of the march.\nPolice officers, some wearing riot helmets, lined the mayor's yard as protesters arrived and sat in the middle of the residential street for a while, before marching on.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTOS: Jared Chase\nBrent Betterly\nBrian Church (A14)\n People gathered outside Mayor Rahm Emanuel's house to protest clinic closings and support mental health care for veterans.
