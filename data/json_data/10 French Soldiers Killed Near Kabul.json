He said he would travel to Kabul later in the day.\n  The ambush took place on Monday, when French parachutists were on a joint reconnaissance mission with the Afghan Army, the president said. They were quickly pinned down, and eventually fought off the attackers when allied air support arrived. \n  ''I acknowledge with respect and emotion the courage of these men, who fulfilled their duty to the point of the supreme sacrifice,'' Mr. Sarkozy said. ''My determination is intact. France is determined to pursue the struggle against terrorism, for democracy, and freedom.'' \n  Afghan officials told The Associated Press that the ambush took place in the Surobi district of Kabul Province, about 30 miles east of Kabul, the Afghan capital. One official said that four of the French soldiers who died were first captured by the attackers, and then were killed. \n  France has about 3,000 military personnel in Afghanistan, operating as part of a NATO-led coalition. The A.P. said the ambush on  Monday was the deadliest attack against international troops in the country since June 2005, when 16 American troops were killed in Kunar Province.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: August 20, 2008"
