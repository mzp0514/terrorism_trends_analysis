    "full text": "Dear Editor: Observing the incompetent and criminal stumblings of the Bush administration, many people assume the Democrats have already won the election in 2008.\nNot really. The Democrats' penchant for defeating themselves is far greater than the Republicans'. Look at all the opportunities they are missing now.\nWhile the disaster in Iraq rages on, the Democrats never bother to remind people of the Project for the New American Century, which was supposed to topple Muslim governments across the Middle East and replace them with democracies - a piece of foolishness hard to match.\nWhen it was reported in even the mainstream media that a panel of retired generals and diplomats had announced that Bush's invasion of Iraq was fueling al-Qaida's recruitment drive rather than fighting terror, that was an opportunity for the Democrats to impeach him. Gross incompetence in a head of state is a misdemeanor, if not a high crime. Instead, the news made barely a ripple and disappeared.\nWhile the Democrats criticize Bush's war on terror, they offer no alternative of their own for ending terrorism. Because they have none. There is a solution to terrorism. It's only the politicians who are clueless.\nIf the tragedy of Iraq spreads and engulfs the entire Muslim world, the Republicans will simply crank up their spin machine, and blame it all on the \"obstructionist\" and \"defeatist\" Democrats for sabotaging their glorious plan.\nTwo hundred and thirty-one years after the Declaration of Independence, this is what our republic has sunk to.\n\nLoad-Date: July 18, 2007"
