    "full text": "Atwo-year Islamic uprising against Algeria's army-backed regime has killed 3,000 people in the northwest African nation, with many more being threatened unless the government and militant Muslims can come to a peace agreement.\nLamine Zeroual took office as president last week and vowed to keep fighting militant Muslims while also offering talks on ending the rebellion.\nThis is how the war started:\nIn January of 1992, an army coup blocked an expected victory by Islamic fundamentalists in Algeria's first multiparty parliament elections. The government also canceled all non-religious activities at Algeria's 10,000 mosques.\nUnrest has persisted despite curfews, army sweeps and trials in secretive anti-terrorism courts.\nThe French Foreign Ministry condemned the slaying and renewed its warnings to French citizens still in Algeria. Thousands have returned to France, Algeria's former colonial ruler.\nTwenty-seven foreigners have been slain since militant Muslims declared last year that foreigners would be targets.\nThe Armed Islamic Group, considered the most radical of a handful of radical groups, warned foreigners in November to leave Algeria or risk death.\nMuslim militants have targeted foreigners partly because their skills and investment are vital to the economy. They also have attacked Algerian intellectuals and journalists.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO, Goitia-Bounhar/Associated Press: An Algerian tank waits near Parliament in Algiers in January 1992.\n\nLoad-Date: September 15, 1994"
