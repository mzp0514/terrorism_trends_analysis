    "full text": "The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center raised a question that few Americans have spent much time considering: What can we do to prevent and combat terrorism?\nTom Preston, a part-time instructor at University of Kentucky, has been grappling with these questions for years.\nPreston is CEO of Preston Global, a Versailles firm that specializes in crisis management and anti-terrorism.\nU. Kentucky\n\"We provide programs for the prevention and response to any aggressively defiant acts,\" said Preston. These programs can include workplace violence, violent protests and terrorism.\n\"The first thing we do is make a vulnerability assessment,\" said Preston, explaining the work of his firm. \"We look at the organization as though we were the adversary. How would a terrorist try to attack the organization?\" To accomplish this, Preston Global examines the motives, philosophies and techniques of potential terrorists.\nPreston gave as an example \"certain zealous environmental groups\" who attack animal laboratories. These groups often resort to arson as a means to release the animals, so Preston would first work to make the laboratory safe from arson.\nPreston Global is unique because it combines several types of services, such as those provided by public relations and security firms. Preston said, \"We blend the issues of security, reputation management with intelligence gathering and analysis, with communication and media training and litigation abatement.\"\nPreston Global began as a public relations firm and continues to provide these services. Intense media scrutiny often follows a violent incident. \"We work to protect the favorable reputation of the company and to prevent and correct false rumors,\" said Preston.\nWhile Preston does not release the name of his clients, he said, \"We represent corporations and institutions, and sometimes government agencies or even individuals.\"\nPreston Global once protected a former British prime minister. A non-profit group asked the prime minister to give a speech in the Midwest. When they learned a terrorist group planned to violently disrupt the speech, they called Preston Global. \"We provided counsel and advice for the safety of the event and the prime minister,\" said Preston.\nThey also worked for one of the largest religious organizations in America, when the organization learned that a militant splinter group was planning to bomb a televised Christmas pageant. \"We provided a plan to intensify security, to protect from and also [to] discourage the attack. The situation calmed when the opposition realized it was the worst thing they could do, that we were too well-prepared,\" Preston said.\nMany of Preston's clients come after a violent incident has occurred. However, Preston said, \"We are seeing an increase of those who think prevention rather than response and reaction. They are finding that prevention is more cost effective.\"\nPreston believes that the recent terrorist attacks will make services such as his more visible. \"When an incident occurs, there is always increased attention from both existing and potential clients.\"\nPreston says that America's response to these attacks may eventually help prevent terrorism. \"I believe that, in the long term, there is a good chance that President Bush's activities will have a dramatic impact on the ability of terrorists to inflict damage.\"\nPreston's optimism did not come without a warning. He said, \"This is not to say that we will not experience one or more terrorist events in the near future. We are dealing with a huge network of people who hate the U.S.\"\n\"Bush is definitely on the right path, however,\" Preston continued. \"He is moving aggressively, properly and with absolute determination.\"\n(C) 2001 Kentucky Kernel via U-WIRE\n\nLoad-Date: October 1, 2001"
