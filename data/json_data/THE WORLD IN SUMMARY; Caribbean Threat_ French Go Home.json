    "full text": "Although a majority of Guadeloupeans have repeatedly voted against independence, a tiny fraction of frustrated proponents have turned to terrorism to further their aims.\nSince March, a group calling itself the Guadeloupe Liberation Army has claimed responsibility for 15 incidents of violence on the sevenisland French Caribbean state, including an explosion that shattered the passenger terminal at the airport on Dec. 28, the day before French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing returned home from a vacation on Guadeloupe.\nGuadeloupe Liberation Army bombs perfume and fashion shop in Paris\nLast week, the terrorists followed Mr. Giscard d'Estaing to the French mainland, setting a bomb that destroyed the Chanel perfume and fashion shop in central Paris and slightly injured a watchman.  The group demanded the immediate departure of ''French colonial forces'' from Guadeloupe and warned: ''From now on, we will fight on the soil of the Continent for national independence.''\nThe violence has surprised French officials who note that Guadeloupe, as an overseas French department or state, has the same political rights as Normandy or Brittany. Guadeloupeans are eligible for all French social services and their standard of living exceeds that in former British Caribbean colonies that have gained independence since World War II. However, unemployment in France has reduced work opportunities for islanders who used to migrate and find work in the French Army or civil service. Unemployment on Guadeloupe is about 40 percent."
