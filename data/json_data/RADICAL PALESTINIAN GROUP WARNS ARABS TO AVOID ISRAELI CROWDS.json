    "full text": "A day after claiming responsibility for a bombing that killed five people, a Palestinian group warned Arabs to avoid \"crowded Israeli areas,\" emphasizing that it was planning three more attacks.\nThe warning leaflet was circulated by the Muslim fundamentalist group Hamas, the leading opponent to the PLO-Israeli peace talks.\nIt also scorned PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat for condemning Wednesday's bombing and a similar one April 6.\nArafat, under American pressure to condemn the attacks, phoned Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Wednesday and disavowed violent acts by Palestinian opponents of the peace talks. On Tuesday, he sent a letter to President Bill Clinton, in which he said he strongly condemned attacks on Israeli civilians.\nRabin said earlier that Arafat's failure to condemn terrorism had called into question his sincerity in the negotiations and was fueling Israeli opposition to the PLO-Israel accord. The agreement provides for an Israeli withdrawal and Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho.\nBut Rabin made clear that he would continue the negotiations. Otherwise, \"there will be an increase in the number of organizations that will be involved in terrorism, in violence and terror,\" he said on Israel radio.\n\nLoad-Date: April 16, 1994"
