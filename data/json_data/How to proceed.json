    "full text": "All of us were appalled and angered by the bombing in April of the federal building in Oklahoma City. Our hearts and prayers go out to the victims and their families.\nWords cannot express our horror and anger at this act of terrorism, or our determination to prevent such terrorism in the future. We have to prevent such terrorism and we have to act quickly and decisively to do so.\nBut we have to approach it objectively and with reason and common sense.\nIf our efforts in this are guided only by our pain and anger, born of the immediacy and intensity of the moment, then they will be done without due regard for how our efforts could return to haunt us in the future.\nI'm concerned about giving government and law enforcement agencies more power and authority to intervene and restrict our lives and actions. We could erode even basic liberties. That could happen if we're not careful. Once such powers are granted, it is very difficult to limit them, and very easy to expand them.\nI'm also concerned about possibly adding more fuel to the fires of fringe groups and radicals who are angry at the government to begin with. That too could happen if we're not careful here.\nIf we deal with terrorism by crawling into our shells and living in fear, then the forces of terrorism will have won. If we give up our liberty in return for safety, the forces of terrorism, again, will have won.\nBut if we deal with terrorism in a calm, reasoned way, guided by common sense, as good stewards of our government and of liberty, then the forces of terrorism will lose, and we and the forces of liberty will win. That is how we must deal with this.\n\nLoad-Date: June 5, 1995"
