    "full text": "MIAMI - An accused al-Qaida bomb-maker who went to college in Arizona told military officials at the U.S. base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, that he believed an unnamed member of the Saudi royal family was part of an effort to recruit him for violent extremist acts before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, according to a newly released transcript.\nGhassanAbdallahal-Sharbi said a religious figure in Saudi Arabia used the term \"your highness\" during a telephone conversation with the man, just before urging al-Sharbi to return to the U.S. and take part in a plot against the U.S. that would involve learning to fly a plane.\nThe Sept. 11 commission found there was no evidence to indicate that the Saudi government as an institution or Saudi senior officials individually had supported the attacks, and the kingdom's government has consistently denied it had any role in the plot.\nIt was early 2001, and al-Sharbi had only recently returned from the United States, where he had taken some flight school courses in Phoenix with two men who would become hijackers in the 9/11 attacks.\nAl-Sharbi described the conversation in June to the Periodic Review Board, which assesses whether Guantanamo prisoners can be released. The Pentagon on Thursday posted a transcript, with parts blacked out, on the website of the board, which includes representatives from six U.S. agencies and departments.\nThe statement is convoluted and lacks important details, such as whether the \"religious figure\" might be close to any Saudi officials. It also does not indicate who the Saudi royal might be. The term can be used for thousands of members of the Saudi royal family; al-Sharbi did not say he met the man.\nAl-Sharbi also appeared to be struggling with illness. He told the board he had just come from the detainee hospital, was \"really exhausted, and nauseous and lethargic,\" and used what was described as a \"manual breathing device.\"\nHis statement adds to a list of suggestive but hardly definitive clues about possible involvement by members of the Saudi establishment in the Sept. 11 attacks, in which 17 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi.\nThe Saudi Embassy in Washington declined to comment on the al-Sharbi transcript. In the past, the Saudis have pointed to the 9/11 Commission, FBI investigations and other probes that found no Saudi government or royal family involvement in the attacks.\nIn the transcript, Al-Sharbi said he listened as the \"religious figure\" spoke to the man - whom al-Sharbi believed was a royal - as they discussed al-Sharbi's qualifications for returning to the U.S. for jihad.\n\"I remember, 'yes, your highness, yes your highness,' and he was talking to him about me,\" al-Sharbi said.\nSaudi Arabia has battled with al-Qaida over the years, but there have been consistent allegations, including by Guantanamo prisoners, of financial and other support by officials and members of the royal family for al-Qaida-linked charities, said terrorism consultant Evan Kohlmann, who reviewed the 28-page transcript.\n\"The Saudi royal family is quite large and diverse, and it is no secret that various members were once reputed for their patronage of Islamist causes and charities,\" Kohlmann said. \"In that light, it is hardly ridiculous that al-Sharbi would have encountered a Saudi royal who sympathized with al-Qaida and Osama Bin Laden.\"\nThe prisoner's candor about his health also may add to what is otherwise a plausible allegation, said Max Abrahms, an assistant political science professor at Northeastern University who studies terrorism. Abrahms also reviewed the transcript.\n\"He is very open that he is really struggling physically, that he's exhausted, that he has been under serious medication,\" Abrahms said. \"But on the other hand it lends additional credibility to his statement because it's not very deliberate and not memorized.\"\nThe review board declined to approve al-Sharbi's release from Guantanamo, where he is among 61 prisoners still held.\n\nLoad-Date: September 18, 2016"
