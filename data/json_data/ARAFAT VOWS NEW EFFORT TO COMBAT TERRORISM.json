    "full text": "U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher won a fresh commitment from Yasser Arafat Saturday to try to stem political violence by Palestinian groups. Christopher also hailed the \"important steps\" the PLO chief already has taken.\n\"I was very pleased this morning to have Chairman Arafat emphasize his complete commitment to combatting terrorism in all the territories of the West Bank and Gaza,\" Christopher said after a one-hour meeting with Arafat in Gaza.\nChristopher is on a Middle East shuttle aimed at pushing forward negotiations between Syria and Israel.\n\"The chairman has been speaking out against terrorism and has been taking very important steps to work with authorities in the region to ensure that violence and terrorism shall be kept to a minimum,\" Christopher said at a news conference.\nFormer Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon charged in a Jerusalem Post article Friday that Arafat had \"consistently broken\" his commitment to stop Palestinian acts of violence. Since 1993, 162 people have been killed in such violence.\nA U.S. State Department report last month credited Arafat with helping to avert violence, although it criticized him for appearing to support guerrilla actions in some speeches.\nArafat did not mention the issue at the news conference and evaded a question about last week's assassination of Yahya Ayyash, a master bombmaker for the militant Hamas movement.\nThe cellular telephone that exploded and killed Ayyash is widely assumed to have been booby-trapped by Israeli intelligence agents. Israel declined to officially comment on the case.\nLater in the day, Christopher briefed Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres on his four-hour meeting Friday in Damascus with Syrian President Hafez Assad.\nChristopher said the leaders of Israel and Syria were determined to reach an agreement by the end of the year.\nt Talks are scheduled to resume near Queenstown, Md., on Jan. 24.\nPeres took a more restrained view of the outlook for an accord. \"Things are moving ahead,\" he said. But he added, \"You cannot achieve everything in one jump.\"\nChristopher was to fly back to Washington on Sunday.\nPope's Warning\nIn Vatican City, Pope John Paul said Saturday that Middle East peace could be dashed if differences persisted over the status of Jerusalem. He called for international guarantees to preserve its multi-religious nature.\nIn an annual state of the world address, he criticized Muslim states that he said denied religious freedom and said that African leaders would condemn their continent to pariah status unless they mended their ways.\nHis speech, to ambassadors from more than 160 countries that have relations with the Holy See, included a call for a swift end to nuclear testing. French President Jacques Chirac will visit the Vatican this week.\nDiscussing Jerusalem, the pope said the city, sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, should be the subject of negotiations between Israel and the new Palestinian Authority during 1996.\nWhile the Vatican and Israel established full diplomatic relations in 1994, both sides are still formally at odds over the status of Jerusalem. Most countries, including the Vatican, do not recognize Israel's claim to Jerusalem as its \"united and eternal capital\" following annexation of the Arab eastern sector in 1980.\n\nLoad-Date: January 14, 1996"
