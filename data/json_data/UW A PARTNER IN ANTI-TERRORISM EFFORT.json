    "full text": "UW-Madison will help protect the nation's food supply from terrorist attack under a federal grant announced Thursday.\nThe Department of Homeland Security is spending $15 million over three years on an anti-terrorism center at the University of Minnesota.\nPartners in the effort include UW-Madison, Michigan State and North Dakota University, as well as investigators from private industry and federal agencies.\nUW-Madison's piece of the work will focus on the detection of toxins and contamination using biosensors. These devices can detect the presence of certain chemicals or biological materials, along with changes in their levels. In medicine, for example, they are used to measure glucose levels in blood.\nBut adapting biosensors to food protection, especially to defend against tampering by terrorists, requires new thinking, said Lawrence Casper, an assistant dean in the College of Engineering and a leader in the project.\n\"We're looking at creating new devices that can be made fairly easily and inexpensively, and that can be deployed in the field and don't require a lot of expensive equipment for testing,\" Casper said. \"They will be things that can be operated by emergency responders, as opposed to technology that requires very highly trained scientists.\"\nUniversity engineers will work closely with campus biologists and chemists.\n\"Our role is to develop methodologies to rapidly detect toxin and pathogen contamination at any level in the food supply,\" said Michael Pariza, a professor of food microbiology and director of UW-Madison's Food Research Institute.\n/ Contact Karen Rivedal at krivedal@madison.com or 252-6106.  \n\nLoad-Date: July 10, 2004"
