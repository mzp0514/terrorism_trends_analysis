MontanaJohnson, who has spent time in the Middle East as a diplomat, said the forum will be organized within the next two weeks.\nAlthough the panel has not been confirmed, Johnson said he hopes to invite experts on terrorism and people who have survived tragic events as well as using insight from his experiences.\nJohnson said Tuesday's terrorist attacks made him feel sick.\n\"The last time I felt like this, I was a sophomore in high school in Great Falls, and it was because the U.S. might go to nuclear war -- the Cuban Missile Crisis,\" he said.\nDuring those days, before the Soviet Union backed down, Malmstrom Air Force Base outside of Great Falls was on \"full alert,\" he said, and Tuesday may have been the first time it was on full alert since those days in 1961.\nJohnson said he is no stranger to violence, due to his experience in the Middle East, but said he's faced nothing of this scope.\n\"This is a faceless, nameless, horrible attack,\" he said. \"A scene from a living hell.\"\n(C) 2001 Montana Kaimin via U-WIRE\n\nLoad-Date: September 12, 2001"
