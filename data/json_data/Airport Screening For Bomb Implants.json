    "full text": "Osama bin Laden is dead. Other top al-Qaida operatives have been targeted and killed. Terrorism worldwide has lost momentum.\nBut the war against terrorism is far from over.\nThe U.S. government has warned airlines that terrorists are considering surgically hiding bombs inside humans to evade airport security.\nSuch implants could be difficult to detect, experts warn.\nTherefore, passengers flying into the United States this summer may notice additional security. In addition to the use of full-body scanning and hand pat-downs, security measures may include more intensive verbal interaction with passengers.\nThose who have complained about scanning and pat-downs now have something else to gripe about: Is it really necessary to answer an intrusive battery of questions before boarding a plane?\nWell, yes, it is. The safety of many passengers may be at risk.\nTerrorists are continually looking for new ways to get around security. Remember the fellow who hid a bomb in his underwear at Christmas 2009?\nExplosive experts say surgery to implant bombs could be done a couple of days before a planned attack. An explosive could be implanted in a woman's breast, for example, and the detonator hidden beneath the breast.\nBombs inside the body are not a brand new idea, but recent intelligence indicates a fresh interest in them. Unfortunately, body-scanning machines in airports cannot detect explosives hidden inside humans.\nOnce a terrorist finds a willing suicide bomber and implants a bomb, carrying out a mission would not be so difficult, according to Chris Ronay, a former chief of the FBI explosives unit.\n\"It's rather easy and the damage could be rather severe,'' he says.\nOn the other hand, getting the device to function properly once secured inside a body might not be so simple, says Leo West, a retired FBI bomb expert.\n\"There are more practical ways of doing it,'' he says.\nAnd they also have been tried.\nTerrorists have concealed bombs in printer cartridges and may have considered placing explosives in the insulated lining of beverage containers and carrying them aboard airplanes.\nThe point is that practically anything the human mind can imagine can be tried - as Americans discovered to their everlasting sorrow on Sept. 11, 2001.\nAdditional airport security has slowed down the boarding process and invaded privacy.\nIt also has saved lives.\nAirport security agents must do whatever it takes to stop terroristic maniacs who are willing to explode themselves in order to kill others.\n\nLoad-Date: July 15, 2011"
