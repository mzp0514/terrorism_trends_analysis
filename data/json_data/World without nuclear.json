    "full text": "The congressional Republicans have labeled the Obama administration's plan to reduce the number of deployed nuclear weapons \"reckless lunacy,\" despite the fact that the biggest cuts to our nuclear arsenal have come from Republican presidents (\"GOP pushes back against any further cuts in nukes,\" Feb. 15). Many of us remember too well the national security policy of the Cold War, aptly referred to as MAD (Mutual Assured Destruction). This doctrine theorized that if the nuclear stockpiles of the United States and the Soviet Union were large enough, a full-scale nuclear war would result in reciprocal mass destruction. Lunacy indeed. While the Cold War has ended and the major threats to our national security have changed, the thinking of our current GOP lawmakers evidently has not. What in the world do we plan to do with 1,500 nuclear warheads in fighting terrorism? Imagine what would happen if even one nuclear bomb were exploded in any city anywhere in the world. The consequences are unimaginable.  As President Obama has indicated, it is time to put an end to \"Cold War thinking.\" Policy-makers, national security experts, academics and religious leaders are joining with Obama in calling for \"the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.\" Christine G.
