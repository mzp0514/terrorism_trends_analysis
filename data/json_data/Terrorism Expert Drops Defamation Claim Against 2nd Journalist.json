    "full text": "PLAINTIFF SAYS SUIT WAS WASTE OF MONEY\nTAMPA - After nearly 41/2 years, the final portion of a defamation lawsuit filed by Washington journalist Steven Emerson was dropped.\nIn 1999, Emerson sued the Tampa-based Weekly Planet, its senior editor John Sugg and Associated Press reporter Richard Cole.\nThe weekly newspaper and Sugg, who now works in Atlanta, were dropped from the lawsuit in May. Last week, Cole was dropped.\n\"I was wasting my money in this lawsuit at this point,\" Emerson said Wednesday. \"I think [Sugg and Cole] demonstrated their lack of credibility a long time ago.\"\nThe defendants said Emerson's withdrawal of the lawsuit proves he would have lost had it gone to trial.\n\"I never had any doubt, nor did my attorneys, nor did anyone else,\" Cole said. \"I knew we would win.\"\nIn 1998, the Weekly Planet published a story written by Sugg that criticized The Tampa Tribune's terrorism coverage, saying it relied too heavily on Emerson as a source. Emerson had produced a PBS documentary on the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\nIn Sugg's article, Cole said Emerson was unreliable. Cole had written a series of articles on terrorism for The Associated Press. He said Emerson offered him a terrorism document purported to be from the FBI. When Cole received it, the information seemed to be procured by Emerson and others who worked with him, not the FBI, Cole said.\nAfter the article was published, Emerson filed the defamation lawsuit and sought $33 million in damages. In the lawsuit, he denied misleading Cole.\nWednesday, Emerson said the dropped lawsuit does not mean Sugg and Cole were justified. Restraints on his time and money were his only considerations, he said.\n\nNotes\n\nTAMPA BAY AREA\n\nLoad-Date: September 19, 2003"
