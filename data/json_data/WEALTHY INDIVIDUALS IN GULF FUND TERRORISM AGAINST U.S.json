    "full text": "Wealthy people in Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf countries are providing much of the money for terrorists who attack Americans and Israelis, news reports say.\nAlthough in recent years the United States has focused its anti-terrorism efforts on rogue countries, current and former U.S. officials say the emergence of sophisticated, privately financed networks of terrorists is creating new diplomatic challenges.\nOfficials quoted in The New York Times on Wednesday believe that, among other things, businessmen in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates fed funds to Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, who is charged with being the brains behind the World Trade Center bombing in New York in 1993 and a plot to blow up 11 U.S. jetliners.\nU.S. intelligence agents also are checking the movements of Osama bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi businessman stripped of his Saudi citizenship in 1994, The Daily News and New York One television have said.\nQuoting official sources, the Times said bin Laden paid for terrorism i n Europe, Africa and the Middle East against Americans and other Westerners.\nPhilip C. Wilcox Jr., head of the State Department's counterterrorism office, recently told Congress that people in the Persian Gulf and the United States provide significant support to Hamas and Islamic Holy War, two Palestinian extremist groups.\nSome contributors believe that they are underwriting legitimate charitable organizations, while others knowingly give money to terrorist groups, Wilcox said.\n\nLoad-Date: August 15, 1996"
