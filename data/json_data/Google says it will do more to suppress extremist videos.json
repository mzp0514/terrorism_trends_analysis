The company will also be more aggressive in putting warnings on and limiting the reach of content that, while not officially forbidden, is still inflammatory.\n\"While we and others have worked for years to identify and remove content that violates our policies, the uncomfortable truth is that we, as an industry, must acknowledge that more needs to be done,\" Walker wrote.\nGoogle and other social media and search sites are facing pressure to quickly remove posts by terrorist groups such as Islamic State.
