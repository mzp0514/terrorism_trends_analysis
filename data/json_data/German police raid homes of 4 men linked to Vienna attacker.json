Twenty others, including a police officer, were wounded.\nGerman federal prosecutors said that two of the men whose premises were searched were believed to have met the attacker in Vienna this summer. A third man had contact with him online, while the fourth had no direct contact to the attacker but was in touch with people who knew him.\nProsecutors said they were trying to collect possible evidence during the searches and that nobody was arrested.\nAuthorities in Austria have identified the attacker as 20-year-old Kujtim Fejzulai, a dual national of Austria and North Macedonia who had a previous conviction for trying to join IS in Syria and had been given early release in December.\nAn investigation has been launched into why Austria didn't put Fejzulai under observation despite being tipped off by Slovakian authorities that he had tried to purchase ammunition at a shop in Bratislava in July.\nAustrian authorities detained 16 people in the country in connection with the attack. Four of them had previous terror-related convictions and several others also had criminal records.\nEight of them have now been ordered held in custody pending possible formal charges, while six have been released, news agency APA reported.\nAuthorities in neighboring Switzerland also took two people into custody this week.\nAmid concerns that authorities missed warnings signs leading up to the attack, officials said Friday that the head of the Vienna regional anti-terrorism agency has stepped aside from his post and several other officials involved in the investigation are also being replaced.\n\"There were, in our view, intolerable errors made in the investigation,\" Interior Minister Karl Nehammer told reporters.\nAustrian authorities also announced that they have ordered the closure of two mosques in Vienna that were frequented by the attacker. About 70 police were involved in shutting down the two mosques Friday.\nSusanne Raab, Austria's minister for integration, said the mosques were deemed to have provided what she described as \"a breeding ground for dangerous ideology.\"\n\"I want to emphasize that it's not a fight against Muslims in Austria,\" she said. \"We're all fighting together, because Muslims in Austria are also among those who are particularly threatened by political Islam and radicalism.\"\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.
