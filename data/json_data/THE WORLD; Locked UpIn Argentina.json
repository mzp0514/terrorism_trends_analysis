General Videla led the coup that brought the military to power in 1976 and was President for the next five years, the time of almost all of the more than 8,000 disappearances, hundreds of executions and uncounted instances of torture.\nIt was the first indictment of an officer brought by a military court over the abuses, and came half a year after President Raul Alfonsin accused General Videla and eight other junta members of spreading ''terror, pain and death throughout Argentine society.'' The former leader joined two other officers - one the head of a torture center, the other a police chief - being held by the military on human rights charges. Another officer, Air Force Brig. Orlando Ramon Agosti, was questioned last week by the top military tribunal. Several hundred officers have been charged with human rights abuses by civilian courts, but many of the cases are being transferred to military jurisdiction in a gamble by Mr. Alfonsin to allow the armed forces to cleanse themselves.\nGeneral Videla had rejected appeals from worried officers to take the blame for the abuses, instead leading a campaign defending the junta's actions as necessary to combat terrorism. Even his conviction, however, would be unlikely to satisfy human rights groups, which last week submitted a list of 896 military officers they contend were involved in the disappearances.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nphoto of Jorge Rafael Videla"
