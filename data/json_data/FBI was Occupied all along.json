    "full text": "FBI counter-terrorism agents were investigating Occupy Wall Street before protesters even erected the first tent in Zuccotti Park last year, new documents show.\nThe FBI met with New York Stock Exchange officials to tip them off about the coming protest as early as Aug. 19, 2011, about a month before the \"occupation\" began, according to internal bureau documents, which were obtained and released by the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund.\nThe records show an agent notified officials at Federal Hall and the Museum of American Finance that each of their buildings were \"a point of interest\" for the protest.\nThe documents are heavily redacted, but show the agency improperly gathered information on Americans involved in legal activities, the head of the civil-rights organization in Washington said.\n\"(It's) a window into the nationwide scope of the FBI's surveillance, monitoring, and reporting on peaceful protestors organizing with the Occupy movement,\" said Mara Verheyden-Hilliard, the partnership's executive director.\nThe investigation included cities across th e country, all of which followed the New York protest.\nMembers of the movement said they weren't surprised at the new report.\n\"While we were down there, we were very sure we were being surveilled,\" said Rebecca Manski, a member of the Occupy Wall Street press team.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nNLVL\n\nLoad-Date: December 26, 2012"
