    "full text": "Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on Thursday delegated to his top deputy the final word on which terrorism suspects are to be tried by a military tribunal.\nThe deputy, Paul Wolfowitz, also was given the authority to decide who will serve on the tribunals, which the Pentagon calls commissions.\nAfter President George W. Bush determines which terrorism suspects in U.S. custody are subject to be tried under his Nov. 13, 2001, military order, a chief prosecutor will draft charges against any or all of those suspects. Wolfowitz then would decide which actually go to trial, according to Air Force Maj. John Smith of the Pentagon's Office of Military Commissions.\nThis authority had rested with Rumsfeld, but he chose to delegate it to Wolfowitz, Smith said.\nThus far, Bush has not determined which, if any, terrorism suspects are subject to potential prosecution.\nThe criteria for such a presidential determination are that a suspect be a member of the al-Qaida terrorist organization; or that he or she c ommitted or conspired to commit a terrorist act against the United States; or that the suspect knowingly harbored an al-Qaida member; and that it is in the best interests of the United States that the suspect be subject to military trial.\nBush's military order does not apply to American citizens.\nThe Pentagon has spent months preparing for tribunals to hold trials for terrorism suspects who are not U.S. citizens. Candidates for the tribunals include some of the alleged al-Qaida leaders in U.S. custody and the 680 or so al-Qaida and Taliban suspects held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO; Photo Headshot - (Paul) Wolfowitz, Deputy secretary of defense\n\nLoad-Date: June 27, 2003"
