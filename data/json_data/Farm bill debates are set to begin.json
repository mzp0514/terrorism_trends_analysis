The study's authors acknowledge the figure understates the anti-terrorism effort by the Homeland Security Department's immigration agencies.\nIn addition, because no one knows how many terrorists are in the United States or tried to get in, there is no way to say whether the figure of 12 is too low, too high or about right.\n\"The right number is unknowable,\" co-author David Burnham said in an interview. \"But the budget and powers of this agency are influenced by all their talk and rhetoric about terrorism and criminals and if that isn't what they are doing, it should be considered by Congress and the public.\"\nHomeland Security spokesman Russ Knocke said the study failed to appreciate record-setting enforcement totals.\nSee story on Page 2A\n* Washington\nFarm-state members of Congress are facing a tough reality as they begin to consider the next six-year farm bill - a tight budget environment, and the lack of money to significantly add or expand popular programs.\nTwo House Agriculture subcommittees approved parts of the legislation last week, but several amendments were deferred as committee leaders worried about spending too much money.\nTo start, Congress will have less money to work with this time around. This is because the last bill, written in 2002, saved the government billions of dollars.\nThat law pays farmers more when prices are low, and commodity prices have been high. So Congress must start with a lower baseline.\nSee story on Page 3B\n\nLoad-Date: May 29, 2007"
