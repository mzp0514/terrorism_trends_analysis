    "full text": "CAIRO, EGYPT - Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi on Saturday in a fresh push to strengthen relations as Egypt enters an unpredictable era in which an untested political Islam is clashing with a secular military over control of the nation.\nClinton's talks with Morsi signaled a stark contrast to the days when U.S. diplomats visited President Hosni Mubarak, a stalwart American partner on countering terrorism and preserving Egypt's peace treaty with Israel. With Mubarak toppled by popular revolt last year, Washington is recalibrating its approach to a new Islamist president suspicious of American designs on the Middle East.\nClinton focused on calming the intensifying power struggle between Islamists - Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood - and the army, which seized control after Mubarak's ouster.\nClinton stressed support for Morsi - Egypt's first freely elected president - and today is expected to meet Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, Egypt's top military commander.\n\"Democracy is hard,\" Clinton told reporters after her meeting with Morsi. She added that \"it requires dialogue and compromise and real politics. So we are encouraged and we want to be helpful, but we know that it is not for the United States to decide. It is for the Egyptian people to decide.\"\n\nLoad-Date: July 15, 2012"
