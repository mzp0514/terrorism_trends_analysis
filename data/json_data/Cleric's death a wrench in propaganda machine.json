Riedel said the U.S.-born al-Awlaki understood American culture.\nFor example, in one sermon that has been viewed more than 40,000 times on YouTube, al-Awlaki used an anecdote about  pop star Michael Jackson to make a point about the inevitability of death and to suggest jihadists should not fear dying for their faith.\nThe drone strike also killed Samir Khan, editor of al-Qaeda's Inspire, a colorful online magazine that carried lengthy articles and sophisticated graphics.\nKhan, like al-Awlaki, was a U.S. citizen whose messages were often directed at Muslims in the United States and Europe. In Issue 6 of the magazine, Khan praised the \"sacrifice\" of Osama bin Laden, who was killed in May by Navy SEALs in Pakistan.\n\"Propaganda has become an end in of itself,\" Brachman said. \"They do it because they are good at it and they get attention for it.\"\nAl-Awlaki's rhetoric may have inspired Maj. Nidal Hasan, an Army psychiatrist charged with killing 13 people during a shooting rampage at Fort Hood in Texas. The two had exchanged e-mails before the shootings.\nThe United States said al-Awlaki had taken an operational role in planning attacks on America, moving beyond a job as chief propagandist.\nFred Hoffman, a terrorism analyst at Georgetown University, said al-Qaeda  has always seen the value in spreading its message. When al-Qaeda was established in 1988, it set up divisions that included  communications, he said.\n\"They've given it a priority from the start,\" Hoffman said. \"Their survival is dependent on propaganda.\"\nOsama bin Laden even considered changing al-Qaeda's name because he was worried the terrorist organization's reputation had been tarnished because it was linked to killing Muslims. \"Bin laden was concerned about the al-Qaeda brand,\" Hoffman said.\nAl-Qaeda and its affiliates aggressively use the Internet, establishing chat rooms, message boards, videos and websites to engage Internet-saavy people around the world. They have produced documentary-style videos, Brachman said.\nThe production value of the videos and websites is often sophisticated, analysts say. But the U.S. successes against al-Qaeda hurt  its ability to produce quality videos and other media products.\n\"In their heyday, they were as good as any indie documentary filmmaker,\" Brachman said. \"Those days are gone.\"\nAs al-Qaeda's central leadership has weakened, affiliates have used public relations to build their status.\nAl-Awlaki's propaganda skills elevated his affiliate, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, among militant groups. \"It catapulted al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to first among equals,\" Brachman said.\nContributing: Mona Alami in Beirut and Aamer Madhani \n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO, B/W, AP\n\nLoad-Date: October 3, 2011"
