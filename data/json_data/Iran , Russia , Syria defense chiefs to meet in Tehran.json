At home, they'll have a raucous crowd behind them and last change so DeBoer can get the matchups he wants.\nDehqan also strongly denounced United States and Saudi support for what they call \"moderate rebels\" as further proof of the falsehood of their anti-terror slogans.\n\"For over five years Syria has been confronting Takfiri terrorism led by the USA which exerted enormous efforts to fight Syria, making it imperative for us to confront terrorism\", he explained.\nAl-Freij described the results of an earlier meeting he held with his Russian counterpart Sergey Shoygu as \"excellent\", adding that a recent array of measures is expected to yield even better results.\nThe defense ministers are to exchange viewpoints on the latest regional developments and ways to strengthen and extend the fight against terrorism during the trilateral meeting, the IRNA news agency reported.\nIt is not clear exactly what the major themes of the meeting were, but most likely one possible agenda have been coordinating offensives and plans now that the Syrian army is nearing Raqqa.\nIran has also been offering advisory military assistance to the Syrian government.\nSyria has been the scene of a conflict since March 2011.\nLike this:\nGawker files for bankruptcy, to sell itself to Ziff DavisNiger, Chad to fight in Nigeria against Boko HaramCristiano Ronaldo fit, ready to lead Portugal in Euro 2016: CoachCliffs Natural Resources Inc Upgraded to \"Outperform\" by MacquarieCourt: No right to carry concealed weapons in publicHockey Legend Gordie Howe Dies at 88Keiko Fujimori concedes defeat in Peru presidential voteTurkey blames Kurdish militants for Istanbul vehicle bombingHello, Nihonium.
