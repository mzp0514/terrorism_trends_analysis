Mr. Beringer is completely off target.\nThen, as now, success in suppressing state-sponsored terrorism (or piracy) depended on decisive action by the European powers.\nIn 1801 Europe was absorbed in the Napoleonic wars. The American action went almost unnoticed and was indeed inconclusive.\nHowever, the true precedent for 1986 was not 1801, but 1815, when a U.S. naval task force entered the port of Tripoli and forced its ruler to sign a treaty abolishing all tributes, freeing all American hostages and paying an indemnity. This bold and successful raid galvanized the European powers, which had just defeated Napoleon. The Congress of Vienna, then in session, decided to combat piracy, and within several months powerful European naval assaults put an end to this scourge.\nAs in 1815, the 1986 raid has prompted Europeans to take a unified stand against terrorism (the Tokyo statement) and begin undertaking serious measures to combat it. The outcome of the 1815 precedent is hardly an ill omen for the prospects of this endeavor.
