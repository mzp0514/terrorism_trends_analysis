    "full text": "MOSCOW (AP) - Russia's prime minister promised Friday to pursue peaceful ways of ending the war in Chechnya even as other reports indicated the rebels were planning a new terrorism campaign to avenge their leader's death.\nPrime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said his government will use ''all mechanisms and all possibilities to settle the Chechen conflict,'' the Interfax news agency reported.\nHe said Russia was committed not to return ''to the blood and terror of the war,'' and that President Boris Yeltsin's peace initiative would go forward.\nYeltsin has been eager to put the unpopular war on the back burner until after the June 16 election, in which he is seeking a second term. But the death of rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev this week has created new uncertainty about a slowing of fighting or possible peace talks in the 16-month war.\nChechen rebel leaders said Dudayev was killed Sunday in a Russian air strike and was buried in southern Chechnya at a site they refuse to reveal.\nHis successor, Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, has ruled out peace talks with Moscow until Dudayev's killers are found and punished, Russian television said.\nSergei Stepashin, former head of Russia's Federal Security Service, said rebels were planning at least a dozen acts of terrorism to avenge Dudayev's death.\n\nLoad-Date: April 28, 1996"
