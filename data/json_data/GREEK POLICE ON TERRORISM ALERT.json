Greek officials said there had been anonymous calls threatening terrorist attacks if extradition is granted.\nOfficials said that the Athens diplomatic mission of the Palestine Liberation Organization had reacted strongly to legal developments this week involving the Palestinian, Mohammed Rashid, who is 35 years old.\n \nSpecial Vehicles and Police Units\nThe United States wants Mr. Rashid to face charges in connection with the bombings of two American airliners in flight in which a total of five people were killed.\nThe officials said armored vehicles and special police units were stationed around the Athens airport, the offices of American airlines and United States bases.\nAn Athens court this week dismissed Mr. Rashid's claim that he had been mistaken for someone else.\nIt proceeded with the extradition hearing, but then postponed it until Sept. 5 at the request of Mr. Rashid and to get additional documentation.\nMr. Rashid, who was arrested in Greece and charged with traveling under a false passport, has admitted to being a supporter of the P.L.O. He is wanted by the American authorities in connection with the attacks on the airliners in 1982 and 1986."
