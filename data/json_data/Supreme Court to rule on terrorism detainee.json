    "full text": "WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court agreed Friday to hear the case of a U.S.-born man captured during fighting in Afghanistan and held without charges, the latest setback for the Bush administration and its assertion of broad new powers to prosecute the war on terrorism.\nOver the administration's objections, the court said it will consider the treatment of Yaser Esam Hamdi, a suspected Taliban foot soldier held at a U.S. naval brig in South Carolina.\nThe government calls Hamdi an \"enemy combatant\" and says he is ineligible for ordinary legal protections. The administration says it is reluctant to allow enemy combatants access to lawyers because that could greatly inhibit efforts to obtain information from them about potential terrorist operations.\nUnlike almost all the others picked up overseas since the Sept. 11 attacks, Hamdi is an American citizen. He was born to Saudi parents living in Louisiana but was raised in Saudi Arabia.\nOther terrorism cases are still at or near the high court's doorstep, including the case of another U.S.-born terror suspect held indefinitely without access to lawyers. Jose Padilla, a former gang member and convert to Islam, was picked up in Chicago in 2002 and detained in connection with an alleged plot to detonate a radioactive \"dirty bomb.\"\nThe Supreme Court could choose to consider the two cases together, simultaneously addressing the rights of U.S. citizens captured abroad as well as those picked up in the United States.\nThe cases raise basic legal and constitutional questions.\n\nLoad-Date: January 13, 2004"
