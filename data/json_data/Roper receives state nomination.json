    "full text": "Montpelier Police Chief Russ Roper has been nominated by the Idaho Chiefs of Police Association for appointment to the Statewide Interoperability Executive Council (SIEC). Governor Otter has confirmed Chief Roper as a member. Roper is also a candidate for chairman of the council. The governor will make a candidate decision and appointment in the near future.\nThis council promotes interagency cooperation and provides policy level direction to support efficient and effective use of resources to achieve interoperable communications for public safety in Idaho. This includes radio and telecommunications infrastructure for police, fire and medical personnel.\nThe SIEC functions under the Bureau of Homeland Security and the Military Division of the State of Idaho. It deals primarily with radio communications which are interoperable between all public safety responders, meaning they have the ability to communicate with each other during a crisis or emergency. This mandate is a result of the lessons learned during the domestic terrorism attacks of Sept. 11, 2001;\nEach county has a public safety answering point (PSAP). Bear Lake County's is at the Sheriff's Office and includes the 9-1-1 system. The SIEC will support the establishment of a statewide radio system for all public safety responders to those 9-1-1 calls.\n\"It is a great opportunity to serve at this level\" Roper said, \"I am looking forward to contributing to the state's communication system and the benefits it can bring to our Bear Lake valley.\"\n\nLoad-Date: May 7, 2014"
