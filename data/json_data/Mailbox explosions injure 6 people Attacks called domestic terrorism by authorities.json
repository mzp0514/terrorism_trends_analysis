The bombs appeared to be triggered by being touched or moved.\nMail delivery in all rural areas of Iowa east of Cedar Rapids and in northwestern Illinois was suspended today while authorities investigated the origin of the bombs.\nDennis Schoening, manager of the Quad Cities mail processing and distribution plant in Milan, said it's the first time in his 24 years of service mail delivery was canceled\n\"Even in blizzards, we try,\" he said. \"There may be pockets we can't get to, but we make the effort.\"\nJon Petersen of the ATF said late Friday that officials from an FBI multi-agency terrorism task force and the U.S. attorney's office in Iowa's northern district had a number of leads.\n\"We are working with our profilers,\" he said.\nJensen said the way the bombs were placed suggests they are linked, but more than one person could be involved. She said it appears rural mailboxes were chosen to lessen the chance of someone seeing the bomber tampering with mailboxes.\nThe communities where the bombs were found are within a circular area roughly 120 miles across.\nJensen said it was too early to say whether the bombings were indiscriminate or targeted postal workers or mailbox owners.\nPostal Service vice president Azeezaly Jaffer said the bombs were accompanied by a typewritten note in a clear plastic bag that began: \"Mailboxes are exploding! Why, you ask?\"\nThen it said, in part:\n\"If the government controls what you want to do they control what you can do. … I'm obtaining your attention in the only way I can. More info is on its way. More 'attention getters' are on the way.\"\nIt also said: \"If I could, I would change only one person, unfortunately the resources are not accessible. It seems killing a single famous person would get the same media attention as killing numerous un-famous humans.\"\nThe note was signed, \"Someone Who Cares.\"\n\nLoad-Date: May 8, 2002"
