    "full text": "Secretary of State George P. Shultz asked Congress today to approve a $4.4 billion antiterrorist security improvement program at United States embassies abroad, a 45 percent spending increase that includes fortified new buildings and 1,300 security-related new jobs.\nBut Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California, said that because of the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction act calling for deep spending cuts throughout the government, ''I don't see that flying'' unless cuts are made in the $15 billion foreign aid request and in other activities.\nMr. Shultz said he was subjecting his entire budget to ''intense scrutiny'' and ''scrubbing everything'' to make room for the security improvements, which he said were absolutely essential if the United States was to continue to conduct diplomatic business abroad.\n''We are, believe me, looking very carefully at the staffing of posts overseas and whether we need the post,'' Mr. Shultz told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ''Do we really need to have it or can we provide the service in some other way?''\n''No details are going to escape our notice,'' he told Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina. ''Whether we need all the posts, whether posts need to be staffed the way they are. We have to ask the question, is this thing necessary, really?'' He said this applied to official travel. ''Sometimes I think half the department is flying around somewhere,'' Mr. Shultz said. ''Some of those trips are necessary, but not all of them.''\nMr. Shultz testified on behalf of legislation that also creates a new diplomatic security bureau in the State Department and a new ambassador to counter terrorism. ''We want to give the feeling that we are determined to stamp out terrorism,'' he said."
