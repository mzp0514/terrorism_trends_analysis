    "full text": "Stanford and eight other universities that sent a letter asking the Ford Foundation and Rockefeller Foundation to reconsider anti-terrorism language they added this year to grant agreements. Provosts at the top universities say that the provisions could infringe on academic freedom, mirroring a general concern over restrictive anti-terrorist policies.\nThe Ford and Rockefeller Foundations donated a total of $50 million to U.S. higher education last year. According to The Associated Press, when evidence surfaced that grants from the Ford Foundations had funded a radical Palestinian group, Jewish leaders called for restrictions to prevent grant money from being used to support terrorists.\nNew provisions in the Ford Foundation's grant agreements state that no grant recipients may \"promote or engage in violence, terrorism, bigotry or the destruction of any state\" or \"make sub-grants to any entity that engages in these activities.\"\nSimilar clauses in the Rockefeller policy state that grant recipients must \"not directly or indirectly engage in, promote or support other organizations or individuals who engage in or promote terrorist activity.\"\nIn a letter sent to both foundations in late April, provosts from nine prominent schools -- including Stanford, Harvard, Yale, Princeton and MIT -- said that they are not in a position to regulate everything said by students and faculty members who benefit from the grants. The provosts stated that the new policies were too vague to enforce and that the policies could be interpreted and used against political or cultural activities.\n\"Whatever university administrators may think of the merits of the political views expressed, these fall under the protection of freedom of academic speech,\" the provosts wrote.\nSenior Associate Provost Stephanie Kalfayan added that the provisions are at odds with Stanford's mission to encourage the free expression of ideas.\n\"We're all about the free expression of ideas, and the vagueness of the foundations' wording is troubling,\" Kalfayan said.\nAt Stanford, Ford and Rockefeller grants go to faculty members conducting research in a variety of fields.\nThe University received a total of over $1 million in the past three years from the Ford Foundation, with grants going to programs such as the Committee on Black Performing Arts, the Peace and Cooperation in the Asian-Pacific Region Initiative and the Communication Department's \"Grade the News\" project to improve public awareness of news-media issues.\nApproximately $500,000 was received from the Rockefeller Foundation in the past three years with funding going to the Center for Integrative Research in Science and the Humanities, the Humanities Center for Black Performing Arts and the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research.\nNegotiations between the universities and foundations are still ongoing, but representatives said both sides remain hopeful that concerns will be addressed.\n\"At this point we're hoping that the universities' interest and the foundations' interest are the same,\" Kalfayan said. \"I think they've shown a real willingness to talk, and we're very hopeful that everything will work out.\"\nStudents have also expressed concern over the increasing amount of restrictive actions being taken in the name of anti-terrorism, particularly in the academic arena. For example, the International Studies in Higher Education Act, or HR 3077, was passed by the House of Representatives and proposes to renew the Higher Education Act.\nChanges proposed by HR 3077 include the establishment of an \"International Higher Education Advisory Board\" to direct the Secretary of Education to study \"foreign language heritage communities\" within the United States for national security purposes. HR 3077 also calls for improvements to \"better reflect the national needs related to homeland security, international education, international affairs and foreign language training.\"\n\"This political climate seems to interpret 'terrorism' much the way people used 'communism' under McCarthy,\" said junior Eric Shih. \"After the PATRIOT Act, I'm increasingly skeptical of the term 'terrorism,' which is being used by a variety of people in order to censor or suppress dissent,\" he said.\n(C) 2003 The Stanford Daily via U-WIRE\n\nLoad-Date: May 19, 2004"
