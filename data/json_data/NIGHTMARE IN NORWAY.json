    "full text": "And so, terrorism rears its bloodthirsty head again, sparing no one, not even 80 of the young.\nFirst, explosions tore through government buildings in Oslo, including one housing the prime minister's office. He was not hurt. Seven were killed and at least 15 injured.\nThen, on an island near the city, a man dressed as a police officer opened fire. He didn't attack an army base. He attacked a youth camp connected to the ruling party.\nOne teen tweeted: \"We are sitting down by the beach. A man is shooting clothed in a police uniform. Help us! When are the police coming!\"\nThe question is natural: Why Norway? There are theories.\nEarly speculation - fueled by the fact that a group called Helpers of the Global Jihad praised the attack - lined up dots:\nNorway has a small fighting force in Afghanistan. Norwegian newspapers reprinted the infamous Danish cartoons of Muhammed. The Palestinians and Israelis tried to reach a peace deal in Oslo in 1993.\nLater, police had a Norwegian in custody and reported that his terrorism seemed right-wing. One official said the blast was more Norway's Oklahoma City than its World Trade Center.\nNorway, as placid a place as can be imagined, home of the Nobel Peace Prize, suffers now the agony of mass death and the fear that flows from it.\nThe mind remembers the bomb that refused to go off in Times Square and imagines the carnage a gunman could inflict on any busy street here.\nWe are Norway. Norway is us.\n\nLoad-Date: July 23, 2011"
