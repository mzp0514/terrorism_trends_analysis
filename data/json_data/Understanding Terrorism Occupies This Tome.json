    "full text": "By AMY SMITH LINTON\n\"Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism,\" by Robert A. Pape (Random House, $26)\nIn the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, and with violence on the upswing throughout the world, it’s hard to understand the ideology of terrorism. \nWhy would anyone want to give up her life to explode a bus full of civilians, a train full of commuters, a plane full of innocent bystanders?\nPape, a professor at the University of Chicago and a widely respected scholar, believes we should start by looking at the facts.\nMost of us probably believe that the majority of suicide bombers are young male Muslim fundamentalists motivated by religious fervor. Most of us would be wrong. Pape has assembled a thorough database of the 315 suicide attacks that occurred between 1980 and 2003 and discovered that the majority of suicide attacks are a response to foreign occupation rather than religious differences.\nThis single fact, let alone the myriad other details about specific terrorist groups and their strategies and victims, which Pape details in astonishing detail, should drive U.S. policy overseas.\nPape offers a solid, scholarly tome, complete with graphs, tables and profiles of specific terrorists and terror groups. It’s a sober and sobering look at the challenges the United States and its allies face in the coming years as we extend our war on terrorism.\nAmy Smith Linton is a freelance writer from Tampa.\nCopyright © 2005, The Tampa Tribune and may not be republished without permission.
