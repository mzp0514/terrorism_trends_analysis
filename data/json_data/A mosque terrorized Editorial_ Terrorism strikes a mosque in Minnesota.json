    "full text": "EXPLOSION\nIt will take some time to determine who was behind the explosion that ripped through the Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington, Minn., on Saturday morning. But Gov. Mark Dayton was probably right when he called it an act of terrorism. The FBI says the explosion was caused by a destructive device, not by a gas leak or some other mishap. The explosion took place in the imam's office, but fortunately those in the building were elsewhere, and nobody was hurt.\n Hate crimes against Muslims have been rising in the United States. Law enforcement can investigate incidents and the judicial system can hold perpetrators to account, but they can do little about the climate that feeds such hostility. The responsibility for addressing anti-Muslim bias falls upon everyone, starting with the country's political leaders.\n Some have risen to the occasion. When Arizona Senate candidate Deedra Abboud became the target of social-media hate, the man she is trying to defeat - Republican Sen. Jeff Flake - sent her a message of support. \"Hang in there @deedra2018, \" he tweeted. \"Sorry you have to put up with this. Lots of wonderful people across AZ. You'll find them.\"\n Others have been less helpful, to put it gently. President Trump's animadversions against Muslims and his support for a ban on Muslim immigrants insult the character of Muslims and the intelligence of everyone. Forty-eight hours after the Dar Al-Farooq explosion, the president had yet to offer any sympathy or to condemn the attack. That makes it all the more important for others to step up and fill the gap.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nDAVID JOLES\n\nLoad-Date: August 8, 2017"
