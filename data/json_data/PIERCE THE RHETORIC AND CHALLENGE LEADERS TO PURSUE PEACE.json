    "full text": "When challenged about the mounting problems of insurgency and the loss of American lives in Iraq, President Bush repeatedly affirms that we will \"stay the course\" and \"finish the job.\" Do we know what the course really is, or have clarity about the job to be done?\nSince the invasion of Iraq, administration statements articulate a number of courses: to end terrorism, to expand democracy, to bring freedom to the Iraqi people, and to protect the American people and our way of life. Crowds cheer President Bush because we want to believe these things. We almost need to believe them to endure the loss of young American lives, and to support the troops.\n Is staying-the-course/getting-the-job-done an illusion to which both the Bush administration and the American people succumb? Do we not already know that this war cannot, in fact, accomplish these noble hopes? Do we recognize that continuation of the war militates against addressing poverty and hunger, racial and ethnic divisions, and opportunities for education, health care and economic security -- both in Iraq and worldwide?\n Let's implore President Bush to stop cheerleading us along this destructive course. Let's charge our government leaders to embark instead on pursuit of the common good through policies of peace and justice. That course has real potential to spread democracy, enhance freedom and end terrorism.\n\nLoad-Date: August 11, 2005"
