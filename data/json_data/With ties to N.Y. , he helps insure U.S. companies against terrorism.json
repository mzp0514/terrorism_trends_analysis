Wise.\nA former Marine who stands just under 6-foot-4, Wise was named last month as vice president in charge of Ace USA's Terrorism Underwriting Unit.\n\"The unit was actually established prior to Sept. 11,\" Wise said during a recent interview in his Center City office. \"But Sept. 11 heightened the need for different insurance due to the magnitude of the loss.\"\nWise, 47, explained that Ace's policy was a supplement to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, passed in November 2002, which provides insurance against terrorist acts in the United States.\nHe added that Ace's policy was meant to provide insurance for terrorist acts against U.S.-domiciled companies that take place outside the United States.\nNoting that the J.W. Marriott hotel in Jakarta, Indonesia, was attacked by a suicide bomber in August, he said: \"Mr. Marriott would've been the perfect client for our policy.\" Marriott International Inc. was not a client.\nHe said the policy provides property-based physical-damage protection against a catastrophic event up to a limit of $100 million.\nAlthough Wise would not reveal how many policies Ace has sold, he said: \"I can tell you, we have done dozens of $100 million deals around the globe.\"\nHe said the insurance covers catastrophic or significant damage to a building, including business interruption and the expense to rebuild.\nIn his new job, Wise is in charge of a four-person unit based in Philadelphia.\nDuring his first eight months on the job, he said he expected to be on the road about half the time, mainly visiting insurance brokers.\nBefore being named to head the unit, Wise had been vice president and chief operating officer of Ace Diversified Risk, where he oversaw day-to-day operations and audit-compliance activities.\nBoth are part of the Ace Group of Cos., based in Bermuda, which had $12.6 billion in gross premium revenue in 2002 and which has more than 9,000 employees globally. It has approximately 2,000 in the Philadelphia region alone.\nBefore joining Ace in 2002, Wise was vice president of Munich-American Risk Partners in Princeton.\n\"I come from a New York City Fire Department family,\" he said, noting that the department \"took a devastating loss,\" with 343 members killed in the World Trade Center attack. \"I knew 25 of them, and my uncle [Thomas Von Essen] was the commissioner,\" he noted. Wise requested that other details of his private life not be revealed out of security concerns.\nAsked whether he felt that Ace was capitalizing on tragedy, he said: \"Emphatically not. We underwrite risk. This is a risk. I don't feel like I'm capitalizing on tragedy at all. I sleep very well at night.\"\nIn his office, he keeps a bent railroad spike that he found at ground zero soon after Sept. 11 as a reminder of the ferocity of the attack. He keeps it in a beer glass that came from the Tall Ships Bar and Grill, on the ground floor of the South Tower of the World Trade Center, where he used to occasionally meet with friends.\nThey are a reminder of a day of attacks about which he feels too many Americans are becoming complacent. And he repeats his mantra concerning that day: \"Never forget.\"\n*\nPayne Brown has been named vice president of strategic initiatives at Comcast Corp.
