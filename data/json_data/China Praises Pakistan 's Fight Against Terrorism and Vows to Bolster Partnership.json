    "full text": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China praised Pakistan's efforts to combat terrorism and promised to further advance the two countries' strategic partnership and economic cooperation in a speech to the Parliament on Sunday.\nMr. Wen's remarks came a day after China and Pakistan signed $15 billion worth of trade deals, bringing the total value of the agreements signed during his three-day trip to $30 billion over the next five years.\nThe Pakistani government said the two countries had agreed to widen the Chinese-built Karakoram Highway to facilitate trade, and China said it would give more support in the energy sector.\nIn a joint communique, the two countries pledged to cooperate further on security and military issues, energy, transportation, space technology, banking, infrastructure development, heavy machinery manufacturing, cultural exchange and finance.\nAddressing the Pakistan-China Business Summit in Islamabad on Saturday, Mr. Wen noted that the two countries had trade worth just $1 billion in 2002, but $6.8 billion in 2009. He expressed the desire to expand trade between the two countries, which signed a free-trade agreement in 2006, to $10 billion as soon as possible.\nMr. Wen praised Pakistan's sacrifices in combating terrorism and extremism, words that were in stark contrast to warnings from Washington that Pakistan needed to act more aggressively against insurgents.\n''Pakistan has paid a heavy price in combating terrorism,'' Mr. Wen said. ''The fight against terrorism should not be linked with any religion or ethnic group, and there should be no double standards,'' he said as lawmakers burst into applause.\n''The international community should affirm that and give great support, as well as respect the path of development chosen by Pakistan,'' he added.\nThe Chinese prime minister made no mention of India, the estranged neighbor of Pakistan. Pakistan sees China as a counterweight to India in the region, and China's close ties with Pakistan have become a source of growing discontent in New Delhi.\nMr. Wen said the strategic partnership between China and Pakistan was ''in conformity with the national interests of the peoples of the two countries. It would help promote peace, stability and prosperity of the region.''\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: December 20, 2010"
