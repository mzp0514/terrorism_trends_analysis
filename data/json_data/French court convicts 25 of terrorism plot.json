    "full text": "A court convicted 25 people Wednesday of playing roles in preparing a terrorist attack in France in support of Islamic fighters in Chechnya.\nThe five top defendants each received prison terms of eight to 10 years, while the others received lesser sentences. Two were acquitted.\nAll but one defendant had been accused of helping Islamic fighters in Chechnya in what prosecutors said underscored the \"globalization of the jihad movement.\"\nHowever, prosecutors were unable to prove the attack was to have involved chemicals.\nThe prosecution contended the group was plotting an attack in Paris but could not define the target. The Russian Embassy, a police station and the Eiffel Tower were mentioned during interrogations.\nThe court gave the maximum 10-year term to the group's alleged chemicals expert, Menad Benchellali. However, Menad's father, Chellali Benchellali, a Muslim prayer leader in the Lyon suburb of Venissieux, received only an 18-month suspended sentence -- far lower than the prosecution's demand for six years behind bars.\n\"These convictions profit the United States, Algeria and Russia,\" said Isabelle Coutant, lawyer for defendant Merouane Benhamed. \"They have been convicted because they are Muslims.\"\n\nNotes\n\n World \n\nLoad-Date: June 15, 2006"
