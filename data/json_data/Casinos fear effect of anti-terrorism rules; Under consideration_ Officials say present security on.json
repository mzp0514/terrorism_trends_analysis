Coast Guard officials hope to adopt the new rules later this year.\n\"The goal is better security,\" said Dan Dewell, a Coast Guard spokesman in Washington, D.C. \"That's the reason for the regulations and the meetings. We want the industry and the public and anyone who is affected to be involved.\"\nAll of the nation's 361 sea and river ports are being evaluated for vulnerability to terrorism.\n\nLoad-Date: February 14, 2003"
