The U.S., along with Britain, also flew diplomatic staff out of Yemen's capital of Sanaa this week.\nThe U.S. said Friday evening that its embassy in Sanaa will remain closed while the other posts, except for the one in Lahore, reopen Sunday or Monday.\nSince July 27, drone attacks in Yemen's southern and central provinces have killed a total of 34 militants suspected of being members of the country's al-Qaida branch, known as al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, security officials have said.\nOn Thursday alone, the officials said U.S. drones conducted three airstrikes, killing 12 militants.\nThe drone strikes occurred in areas where the terrorist group enjoys protection from anti-government tribes or hides in mountainous areas.\nThe terror network bolstered its operations in Yemen more than a decade after key Saudi operatives fled here following a major crackdown in their homeland. The drone strikes and a U.S.-backed offensive that began in June 2012 have driven militants from territory they had seized a year earlier, during Yemen's political turmoil amid the Arab Spring.\nThe senior Yemeni officials who said the seven Saudis were among the victims of the drone attacks said intelligence suggested the foreigners had crossed the border between the neighboring countries to either ferry in money to the terror group or to train in al-Qaida camps.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n FILE - In this Nov. 8, 2011 file photo, a Predator B unmanned aircraft taxis at the Naval Air Station in Corpus Christi, Texas.
