    "full text": "KENOSHA, Wis. - President Donald Trump stood at the epicenter of the latest eruption over racial injustice Tuesday and came down squarely on the side of law enforcement, blaming \"domestic terror\" for the violence in Kenosha and making no nod to the underlying cause of anger and protests - the shooting of yet another Black man by police.\nTrump declared the violence \"anti-American.\" He did not mention Jacob Blake, who was badly wounded in the shooting last week in Kenosha.\nSoon after arriving in the city, a visit made over the objections of state and local leaders, Trump toured the charred remains of a block besieged by violence and fire. With the scent of smoke still in the air, he spoke to the owners of a century-old store that had been destroyed and continued to link the violence to the Democrats, blaming those in charge of Kenosha and Wisconsin while raising apocalyptic warnings if their party should capture the White House.\n\"These are not acts of peaceful protest but, really, domestic terror,\" said Trump. And he condemned Democratic officials for not immediately accepting his offer of federal enforcement assistance, claiming, \"They just don't want us to come.\"\nThe city has been the scene of protests since the Aug. 23 shooting of Blake, who was hit seven times in the back by police as he tried to get into a car while they were trying to arrest him. Protests have been concentrated in a small area of Kenosha. While there were more than 30 fires set in the first three nights, the situation has calmed since then.\nTrump's motorcade passed throngs of demonstrators, some holding American flags in support of the president, others jeering while carrying signs that read Black Lives Matter. \nOffering federal resources to help rebuild the city, Trump toured a high school that had been transformed into a law enforcement command post. He said he tried to call Blake's mother but opted against it after the family asked that a lawyer listen in.\nHe later added he felt \"terribly\" for anyone who suffered a loss, but otherwise only noted that the situation was \"complicated\" and \"under investigation.\" The only words acknowledging the suffering of Black people came from a pastor who attended the law enforcement roundtable.\nPressed by reporters, Trump repeatedly pivoted away from assessing any sort of structural racism in the nation or its police departments, instead blasting what he saw as anti-police rhetoric. Painting a dark portrait of parts of the nation he leads, the president predicted that chaos would descend on cities across America if voters elect Democrat Joe Biden to replace him in November.\nBiden hit back, speaking to donors on a fundraising call after Trump left Kenosha.\n\"Donald Trump has failed to protect America. So now he's trying to scare the hell out of America,\" Biden said. \"Violence isn't a problem in Donald Trump's eyes. It's a political strategy.\"\nTrump aides believe that his tough-on-crime stance will help him with voters and that the more the national discourse is about anything other than the coronavirus, the better it is for the president.\nBiden said after Trump's Wisconsin visit, \"The vast majority of cops are honorable, decent and real. But the idea that he wouldn't even acknowledge the problem â€“ and white nationalists are raising their heads all across the country.\"\nTrump condemned unrest in Portland, Ore., too, where a supporter was shot and killed recently - and an increase in shootings in cities including Chicago and New York - and tried to take credit for stopping the violence in Kenosha with the National Guard. But it was Wisconsin's Democratic governor, Tony Evers, who deployed the Guard to quell demonstrations in response to the Blake shooting, and he had pleaded with Trump to stay away for fear of straining tensions further.\nClaiming the mantle of the \"law and order\" Republican candidate, Trump insists that he, not Biden, is the leader best positioned to keep Americans safe. \nBlake's family held a Tuesday \"community celebration\" at a distance from Trump's visit.\n\"We don't need more pain and division from a president set on advancing his campaign at the expense of our city,\" Justin Blake, an uncle, said in a statement. \"We need justice and relief for our vibrant community.\"\nProtests in Kenosha began the night of Blake's shooting, Aug. 23, and were concentrated in the blocks around the county courthouse downtown. \nThe violence reached its peak the night of Aug. 25, two days after Blake was shot, when police said the 17-year-old armed with an illegal semi-automatic rifle shot and killed two protesters in the streets. Since then marches organized both by backers of police and Blake's family have all been peaceful with no vandalism or destruction to public property.\nAlso on Tuesday, Trump recycled a baseless conspiracy theory to claim that recent protests have been orchestrated by powerful people in \"dark shadows\" intent on undermining his reelection prospects.\nThe claims first took root on Facebook and Twitter earlier this year after racial justice protests swelled across the country following the deaths of Black Americans in police custody. Thousands of social media users shared posts suggesting a covert network was coordinating the protests and rioters were descending on communities across the country.\nTrump appeared to amplify those unfounded conspiracy theories in an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham that aired Monday night, suggesting that protests in Washington during the Republican National Convention were orchestrated by unspecified forces.\n\"We had somebody get on a plane from a certain city this weekend. And in the plane, it was almost completely loaded with thugs wearing these dark uniforms, black uniforms with gear and this and that,\" said Trump, adding that the matter is under investigation.\n\nLoad-Date: September 2, 2020"
