And we have to stop it.\"\nSantorum came to Lancaster County to award an oversized check for $784,100 to Brubaker Farms of Mount Joy, and two other Pennsylvania farmers. The money will help purchase and operate a digester machine which produces energy from cow manure.\nLuke Brubaker said the goal is to power his farm and sell extra kilowatts to the town's electricity grid.\n\"We could be the Saudi Arabia of the United States,\" Santorum said of Pennsylvania. \"It's a win for those who'd like to win this war and stop funding the enemy.\"\nSantorum, who reiterated his support for President Bush's handling of the war in Iraq, trails his opponent, democrat Bob Casey, by 14 percent, according to a recent Gallup Poll.\nAcross the nation, 65 percent of Americans said they disapproved of our progress in Iraq, something Santorum attributes to our \"love and respect of life.\"\n\"People don't like to open the paper each morning and see people dying,\" he said. \"And the enemy knows that. They know that America doesn't like death.\"\nWhile Santurom said we are winning the war - that the United States has not been attacked since Sept. 11, 2001 is a benchmark of our victory - he urged the crowd to stop doing business with countries that give support to terrorists.\nIt's a fight he took to Congress when he authored the Iran Freedom and Support Act. The legislation, which has struggled during the last two years, goes a step further and refuses trade with any nation that does business with Iran and helps develop the country's nuclear potential.\n\"I see Iran as really the principle threat, not just in the Middle East but in the war on Islamic fascism,\" he said during his visit at Mount Joy. \"It is the principle fomenter of the radical form of Islam and illegitimate jihad.\"\nSo it is with great expectations that the three Pennsylvania farmers featured in Friday's ceremony will begin producing energy from manure in 2007.\n\nLoad-Date: September 10, 2006"
