Household creepy-crawlies frighten Britons more than terrorist attacks, or even death.\nCompiled from World Features Syndicate; This is True; Norfolk Eastern Daily Press; cnnalerts.com; ajokeaday.com E-mail us at theskinny@ madison.com. \nTerrorism only came second on the list of respondents' top 10 fears, according to the survey conducted by RSGB Omnibus for Universal Pictures UK Ltd.\nAnother phobia -- snakes -- ranked third, followed by a fear of heights. Death came in a surprising fifth place as the nation's greatest fear.\n/ Forward-thinking, way back when\nEarly innovations:\n*Sell-by dates on food products -- 1942.\n*Use of checkbooks -- 1660 (England).\n*Color photos in papers -- 1904.\n*Electronic money transfers -- 1871.\n*Wal-Mart begins computerizing -- 1966.\n/ Gripping tale\nDavid Page, 40, of Coltishall, Norfolk, England, was in his yard when he spotted a strange metallic object.\nHe picked it up, wiped it off, opened a cap, found a button, pushed that button â€¦ and only then decided that perhaps, maybe, such an action wasn't a good idea.\n\"What if it's a bomb?\" he wondered. Still holding the button down, he called for help.\n\"I thought I was going to be blown into millions of bits,\" Page said, adding that he taped his thumb to the object to ensure he wouldn't let go.\nBut after four hours, bomb technicians declared the object safe: it was a spare part from a car.\n/ Dopey joke o' the day\nQ. How many programmers does it take to change a light bulb?\nA. None. That's a hardware issue.\n/ Wait!
