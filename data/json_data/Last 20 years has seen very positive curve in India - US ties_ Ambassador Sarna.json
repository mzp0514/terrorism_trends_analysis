Since then, the last 20 years you see a very positive curve in India-US relations,\" he said.\nIn a celebration of India, prominent arts organisation Asia Society is hosting a series of events, including exhibitions, highlighting the country's \"multidimensional aspects\" through the lens of culture, business and policy.\nThe 'Season of India' is a series of programmes and special events on India's arts and culture that is being held in conjunction with the exhibition The Progressive Revolution: Modern Art for a New India, on view at Asia Society Museum from September 14 through January 20, 2019.
