The terrorist is Anis Naccache, who has been on a hunger strike for four months.\nHe and four other men were convicted in the attack July 1980 on Shahpour Bakhtiar, Iran's prime minister before the Islamic revolution in 1979. Bakhtiar escaped injury, but a policeman and a bystander were killed.  Bakhtiar lives in Paris.  Now Naccache, supported by Iran's president and foreign minister, says France promised to free him in the deal that won the release in May 1988 of all French hostages being held by pro-Iranian terrorists in Lebanon.  Naccache is serving a life sentence and could get out of prison only if pardoned by President Francois Mitterrand. Mitterrand has said he might do so, but he has not made clear when or under what circumstances.  Naccache, a Lebanese Moslem, has lost 59 pounds since he started his fast on Sept. 8 and weighs only 105 pounds, said his attorney, Jacques Verges.  Naccache is refusing food but is drinking liquids and is fed intravenously from time to time by doctors at the Fresne prison outside Paris.  Verges said that Naccache had lost his immune defenses. ''If tomorrow someone goes into his cell and sneezes in his nose, he could very well die from it,'' Verges said on French television.  It is widely believed that if Naccache dies in prison, his friends will strike back.  The conservative newspaper Le Figaro editorialized on Saturday, ''The death of Anis Naccache, if it comes brutally at the end of his hunger strike, will by all evidence be serious for France, which would find itself confronted by an increased terrorist menace easy to predict.''\n\nLoad-Date: October 14, 1993"
