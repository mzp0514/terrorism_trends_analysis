Overreacting to failed plots and near misses, they warned, only encourages terrorists.\nNine years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the experts told a House committee Wednesday, the federal government's effort to predict, prevent and respond to terror plots must focus more on local law enforcement, public safety personnel and hometown residents.\nTo date, said Stephen Flynn, president of the Washington-based Center for National Policy, our effort has been \"an away game\" relying on the military and national intelligence agencies to fight the terror threat on distant shores to prevent it from getting here. Now, he said, that threat is here.\n\"The new front lines are the streets of Bridgeport, Denver, Minneapolis and other big and small communities across America,\" Flynn told a House committee. \"We've invested in taking it to the enemy. But keeping the threat at arm's length is not sustainable. We need to focus on the homeland security realm.\"\nLocal authorities, he said, don't necessarily have the expertise or intelligence sources to detect such plots.\nCities like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago have invested in extensive training, but smaller communities need to be as well prepared, said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert and Georgetown University professor.\n\nLoad-Date: September 16, 2010"
