    "full text": "The towers have fallen, the war is on, God is dead, and it's Christmas in Texas. Julia (Cyndi Williams) works the late shift at Paradise Bingo. Racked by migraines and nightmares, she comes home to a short-tempered husband, a daughter who sneaks off at night, terror on the television and an insidious ambient hum. Visions of a large, empty loft creep into her consciousness; she collapses in a supermarket, crashes her car. \nAnd then one morning she wakes up, robs a safe and boards a plane at George Bush Intercontinental Airport. Destination: New York City. Motivation: to escape from the House of Anxiety and seek solace — or annihilation — in the \"Room.\"\nWritten and directed by Kyle Henry, \"Room\" is an existential horror film, a parable of the war against terror being waged in Julia's psyche. A small-scale indie with bountiful ambitions, this resourceful debut ballasts a great deal of conceptual idiosyncrasy (simmering experimental flourishes erupt in a full-blown psychedelic set piece) with strict observations of personality, behavior and the textures of space. \nMs. Williams's intense, single-minded performance is neatly proportioned to the complex location shooting, which deftly ranges from stagnant Houston suburbs to the plasma-screen apocalypse of Times Square to the labyrinthine mysteries of Brooklyn lofts.\nRoom\nOpens today in Manhattan \nWritten and directed by Kyle Henry; director of photography, P J Raval; edited by Pete Beaudreau; music by Fritz Robenalt; produced by Jesse Scolaro, Allen Bain and Darren Goldberg; released by the 7th Floor.
