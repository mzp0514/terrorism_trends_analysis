    "full text": "Editor, Times-Dispatch:\nI applaud the principled stance taken by the Mission Responsibility through Investment committee to recommend the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) drop investments in Caterpillar, Motorola and Hewlett-Packard because they sell products to Israel, which in turn enables that nation to bolster the occupation of Palestinian lands.\nI must have missed the similar announcement about companies doing business in Saudi Arabia, as that country doesn't permit its Christian citizens to . . . Actually, Saudi Arabia has no Christian citizens, as Christians are given only temporary work permits. It is not permissible to publicly practice any faith other than Islam, nor to carry any religious object in public. All non-Muslim worship must be done in private homes. No non-Muslim may even enter the cities of Medina or Mecca. In contrast, there are Christian and Muslim members of the Israeli parliament, the Knesset.\nIsraeli exports tend to be technological, medical and agricultural items and innovations, whereas Saudi Arabia exports oil. And terrorism. Let's not forget that 15 of the 19 suicide bombers on 9/11 were Saudi. I'm still waiting for the announcement. I'm sure it will be along soon.\n\nNotes\n\nCORRESPONDENT OF THE DAY Copyright Â© 2011, The Richmond Times-Dispatch and may not be republished without permission.
