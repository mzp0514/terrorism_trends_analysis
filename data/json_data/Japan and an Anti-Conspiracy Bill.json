Although Japan signed the convention, domestic laws do not fulfill the obligations of the treaty, impeding Japan from concluding it.\n  After recent terrorist attacks in Britain, Sweden and Belgium, last week in Sicily the G-7 leaders called for more cooperation to implement international agreements, including Untoc.\n  Updating domestic laws and concluding the treaty will allow Japan to fill an international legal loophole and contribute to preventing organized crime, including terrorism. Yury Fedotov, executive director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, has welcomed Japan's efforts in this regard.\n  Regarding claims of surveillance fears, the proposed provision criminalizing an act of planning and preparation to commit terrorism and other serious crimes will apply only to ''organized criminal groups,'' and the listed crimes to which the provision may apply are rigorously limited to those likely to be committed by such groups.\n  Few other countries limit the scope of the law as strictly as Japan does.\n  NORIO MARUYAMA, TOKYO\n  The writer is press secretary for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/opinion/japan-and-an-anti-conspiracy-bill.html\n\nLoad-Date: June 2, 2017"
