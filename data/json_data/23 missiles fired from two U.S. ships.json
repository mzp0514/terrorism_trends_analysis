The Chancellorsville, an Aegis cruiser, is based in San Diego, Calif.,  while the Peterson, a destroyer, is based in Norfolk, Va.\nIRAQ DIGESTThe cruiser fired  nine missiles from the Persian Gulf while the destroyer launched 14 from the  Red Sea, officials said. \n \n \n \nBaghdad ignoring cease-fire terms \n \nThe Clinton administration said its attack on Baghdad was in retaliation for a  plot to assassinate former President Bush, but Iraq has also been at odds with  the United States and its allies over reluctance to comply with gulf war  cease-fire terms. Iraq has been stalling over a number of U.N. resolutions  aimed at destroying its weapons of mass destruction and its ability to produce  them. Only Friday President Clinton warned Iraq that its continuing refusal to  allow United Nations inspectors to monitor missile test sites could have  \"quite serious\" consequences. \n \n \n \nBritain says attack was justified \n \nBritain said today that the attack by the United States against Iraq was  entirely justified. A statement from Prime Minister John Major's office said  state terrorism \"must be met with an unambiguous response and must be  deterred by all proper and legitimate means.\"\n\nLoad-Date: June 29, 1993"
