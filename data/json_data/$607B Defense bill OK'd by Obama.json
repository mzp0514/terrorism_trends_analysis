    "full text": "WASHINGTON \"‚Äù President Obama signed a $607 billion Defense bill Wednesday while again protesting congressional restrictions on moving detainees from the prison for terror suspects at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. \nIn a written statement accompanying the bill, Obama said he is \"deeply disappointed that the Congress has again failed to take productive action toward closing the detention facility at Guantanamo.\" \nAt the insistence of the Republican majority in Congress, the bill again forbids the Obama administration from moving Gitmo prisoners to the United States for civilian trials or long-term incarceration. \nThe president, Obama said, must have flexibility to decide \"when and where to transfer\" detainees at the prison, \"consistent with our national security and our humane treatment policy.\" \nObama once promised to close the Guantanamo Bay prison during his first year in office. Nearly seven years into his presidency, 107 detainees remain there because of congressional objections and the reluctance of many counties to accept its prisoners. \nIn again calling for closure, Obama said in his signing statement that the continuing operation of Gitmo \"weakens our national security by draining resources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent extremists.\" \nIt is \"counterproductive in the fight against terrorism,\" Obama said. \nRepublicans said moving detainees to the United States would make Americans more of a terrorism target. \n\"The administration's time would be better spent on a plan to defeat ISIS than on one to move terrorist detainees to our homeland,\" said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. \n\nLoad-Date: November 28, 2015"
