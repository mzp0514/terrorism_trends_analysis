    "full text": "A video purportedly made by supporters of the Islamic State makes  threats against Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey for fighting terrorism on their Internet platforms.\nThe 25-minute  video was released by a group calling itself \"the sons of the Caliphate army.\" In it, photographs of both technology leaders are targeted by bullets. The video was spotted by Vocativ deep Web analysts on the social media service Telegram, which is reportedly used by the Islamic State.\nThe extremist group says it's responding to growing efforts by Facebook and Twitter to suspend accounts and remove posts that they say incite violence and promote terrorism.\nThe video shows hackers changing profiles  and posting Islamic State propaganda. They allege they have hacked more than 10,000 Facebook accounts, more than 150 Facebook groups and more than 5,000 Twitter profiles.\nSons of the Caliphate is a small offshoot of the Cyber Caliphate that analysts speculate is an \"apprentice\" division.\nTwitter declined to comment. Facebook could not be reached for comment.\nInternet companies are under growing pressure to more effectively police the presence of the extremist group in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris and in San Bernardino County, Calif.\nTwitter said this month that it suspended 125,000 accounts connected to the Islamic State, or ISIL, over the past six months.\nVeryan Khan, at the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium, which collects data  on terrorism, says this is the first time an ISIL-linked group has made a threat -- at least publicly -- against Zuckerberg. These groups have threatened Twitter before. After Twitter cracked down on terrorists in 2014, then-CEO Dick Costolo told Vanity Fair that ISIL  threatened to \"assassinate\" him. Dorsey was also threatened last March  for closing accounts. \n\nGraphic\n\n \nphoto USA TODAY\n\nLoad-Date: February 25, 2016"
