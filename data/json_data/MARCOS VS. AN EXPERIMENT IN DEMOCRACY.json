He won again when the Marcosappointed commission on elections attempted to deprive him of his victory.\nIndeed, the triumph of the democratic experiment in Cagayan de Oro City serves as a beacon of hope for nationwide peaceful democratic processes.\nThe spirit of the Cagayan de Oro movement, which gave birth to the Filipino Democratic Party, is not lost on President Marcos. The question is whether, faced with a rising tide of political sophistication and maturation in the reform movements, which now threaten his monopoly of political power, the President is shifting from his measured political liberalization back to state terrorism.\nPresident Marcos knows he cannot win political contests forever. By his high-handed crackdown on the visible leaders of legitimate political movements, is he again provoking his opposition to opt for a violent confrontation, where he has the advantage of U.S. military support? We hope not.\nLet Mr. Pimentel and the Filipino Democratic Party speak. Let the people speak.\nWILFRED M. CORNELLO, New York, April 19, 1983\nThe writer is chairman of the Movement for a Free Philippines."
