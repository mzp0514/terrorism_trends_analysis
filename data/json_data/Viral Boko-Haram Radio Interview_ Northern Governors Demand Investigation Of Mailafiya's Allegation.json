We demand immediate and thorough investigation\", he maintained.\n He also urged Dr. Mailafiya and indeed all citizens with useful information on the activities of criminals and terrorist groups to assist security agencies and Governments at all levels with such intelligence for proper action.\n The Governor further stated that, he hopes that such allegations are not smear campaigns or attempts to discourage the northern governors who are putting in their best to bring an end to insecurity in the region. Lalong reiterated that the Forum does not, and will not support the activities of any criminal group, because as Governors and their families are also not spared as was recently witnessed when the convoy of Governor Babagana Zullum of Borno State was attacked.\n\nLoad-Date: August 13, 2020"
