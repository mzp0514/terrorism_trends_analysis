    "full text": "PRE-NEW YEAR reports that the so-called counter-terrorism legislation\nwas hopelessly derailed in Congress were premature. The reality is that\nCongress faces continued strong pressure from Republican leaders and\nPresident Clinton to act. And, if it does, the danger will not be to\nterrorists, but to law-abiding individuals and groups.\nWithin the next several months, the House of Representatives is expected\nto vote on \"The Effective Death Penalty and Anti-Terrorism Act.\"\nAlthough this proposal is touted as a compromise between Congressional\nsupporters of earlier versions of the bill and some opponents concerned\nabout government overreaching, it grants broad and frightening new\npowers to the federal government in the name of fighting terrorism.\nThis latest version of the ever-evolving legislation would in the name\nof habeas corpus reform take the draconian step of greatly hamstringing\nthe ability of state and federal prisoners to challenge unconstitutional\nconduct by the government that resulted in an unlawful conviction and\nsentence.\nThat is why it is being actively opposed by organizations from across\nthe political spectrum such as the National Association of Criminal\nDefense Lawyers, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Irish National\nCaucus, Gun Owners of America and the Citizens' Committee for the Right\nto Keep and Bear Arms.\nFollowing are some examples of how the Comprehensive Anti-Terrorism Act\nwould expand governmental powers:\ns The secretary of state would have power to designate foreign\norganizations as \"terrorist,\" and to make it a crime to give \"material\nsupport\" to such organizations, even if the support is for legal,\nnon-violent or even charitable activities. Had this bill been law a few\nyears ago, it might have been illegal for religious organizations and\nrelief groups to give anything but medicine and religious materials to\ncertain organizations in Central America or to the African National\nCongress in South Africa.\ns The government would be able to use secret evidence in deportation\nproceedings against any person accused of terrorism, even if the person\nwere a permanent resident of the United States. This means that a\nlong-term legal resident of the United States, married to an American\nwith U.S. citizen-children in school could be deported on the basis of\nfalse accusations without an adequate opportunity to refute the\ncharges.\ns The FBI would be granted enhanced mandatory access in\ncounter-intelligence investigation to travel records about any person\nwho is an agent of a foreign power who may be involved in criminal\nactivities, even if the facts do not establish probable cause that they\nare involved in such illegal activities. The FBI would obtain this\ninformation in secret by means of an ex parte court order.\ns The secretary of state would have power to chose which foreign\nspeakers and performers Americans could listen to at seminars,\nconferences and concerts because the bill gives the secretary the right\nto bar people from the United States based on their membership in a\ngroup, instead of their activities.\ns Federal courts would be required to ignore unconstitutional state\ncourt convictions and sentences, unless the state court decision, though\nwrong as a constitutional matter, was \"unreasonable wrong.\"\nThe risk that an innocent person would be held in prison in violation of\nthe Constitution - or even executed - would increase dramatically\nbecause the bill imposes unrealistically short limits (for the first\ntime in history) for filing a claim of relief.\nThe truth is that the federal government does not need new powers to\nprotect the public against terrorism.\nTimothy McVeigh, the suspect in the Oklahoma City bombing, was swiftly\napprehended by the government using the considerable investigatory and\nenforcement powers already at its disposal.\nFurthermore, had the new law been in place, it would not have prevented\nthe bombing. Some supporters of terrorism legislation are taking\nadvantage of the American public's understandable outrage and horror\nover Oklahoma City to push through a law that will erode our basic\nconstitutional rights.\nNew anti-terrorism legislation is not needed, but if Congress is\ndetermined to do something, rather than nothing, it must at least adhere\nto these principles:\ns All people residing in the United States, whether they are citizens or\nnot, have the right to support the legal activities of organizations and\ngroups of their choice.\nThat is a fundamental part of our First Amendment freedom of\nassociation.\ns People must have a right to examine evidence offered against them,\nregardless of the nature of the charges.\nThat is a fundamental part of our due process of the law.\ns Personal records about people - the airline flights they have taken,\nthe cars they have rented, the hotels in which they have stayed - should\nbe protected from the government's prying eyes unless there is\nsufficient evidence of criminal activity.\nThat is fundamental to our right to personal privacy.\ns Aliens should be barred from the United States as terrorists only\nbased on their illegal activities, not based on their associations with\nothers.\nAny legislation that disrespects these principles deserves to be\nresoundingly rejected.\nChiz is director of the West Virginia Civil Liberties Union, based in\nCharleston.\n\nLoad-Date: February 15, 1996"
