Most messages are passed through couriers and meetings are a rarity, they said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.\nThe training of recruits, Philippine police said, has also been hampered in recent weeks. Peace talks in the Philippines have prompted the Moro Islamic Liberation Front to distance itself from Jemaah Islamiyah and cancel a training program with the group, said Philippines National Security Adviser Victor Mayo.\nOfficials say Jemaah Islamiyah's goal has remained unchanged: to establish an Islamic state in much of Southeast Asia.\nBut with many of its leaders in jail and funds at a minimum, the fight is now increasingly waged by local cells, making their targets harder to predict, according to Indonesian police.\nA report issued Tuesday by the Brussels-based think tank International Crisis Group said that within the organization's Indonesian chapter, most members no longer favor high-profile attacks on Western targets, preferring instead to focus on setting up an Islamic state through religious indoctrination and building a base throughout the country.\n\nNotes\n\nPAGE 2\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO; Photo Headshot - (Alexander) Downer, Warns against complacency\n\nLoad-Date: February 4, 2004"
