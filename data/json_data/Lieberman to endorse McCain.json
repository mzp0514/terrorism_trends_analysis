John McCain, trying to build momentum toward a reprise of his 2000 New Hampshire primary victory, is piling up high-profile endorsements, including one from another political maverick, Sen. Joseph Lieberman.\nThe Connecticut senator, an independent who was the Democrats' 2000 vice presidential nominee, was scheduled to announce his support for McCain at a town hall meeting Monday morning in Hillsborough.\nA Lieberman adviser said the senator decided to back McCain despite being a Republican because he believes his colleague from Arizona \"has the best chance of uniting the country in its fight against Islamic terrorism.\"\nThe adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Lieberman would continue to caucus with Senate Democrats, and said his decision was not a reflection of any lingering tension with his old party after high-profile Democrats abandoned him when he lost the Democratic primary in his 2006 Senate race.\nLieberman subsequently won re-election with an independent candidacy and has since been the darling of many prominent Republicans, including former White House adviser Karl Rove, for pushing a hard line in support of the country's war in Iraq. McCain also supports the war, calling it a critical battlefront in the fight against terrorism.\nA top McCain aide said: \"They are obviously very good friends. McCain helped him in his re-elect, and the significance of the support he will help attract to McCain cannot be overstated.\"\n\nLoad-Date: December 17, 2007"
