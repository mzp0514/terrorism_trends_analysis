In their cases before the state's highest court, Daniels contended that his trial counsel did not provide him effective assistance, while Thomas claimed -- among other things -- that the evidence presented against him was \"insufficient to authorize the jury to find him guilty of the crimes of which he was convicted.\"\nUltimately, Georgia's high court unanimously upheld the pair's convictions.\nOn March 22, 2011, a Colquitt County grand jury returned an 80-count indictment charging Daniels, Thomas and nine other people with various crimes. Daniels was charged with eight counts in the indictment based on incidents that occurred in the area of the Shy Manor Apartments in Moultrie.\nIn those counts, Daniels -- along with others, including Thomas -- was charged with the felony murder of Hunt while in the commission of aggravated assault, the aggravated assault of Hunt, possession of a firearm during the commission of the felony murder of Hunt, possession of a firearm while in the commission of the aggravated assault of Hunt, and separate violations of the Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act.\nThomas was charged in 72 counts of the indictment. Nine counts were based on incidents that occurred in the Sardis Church Road area of Moultrie. In these counts, he and a few others, excluding Daniels, were charged with the felony murder of Perez while in the commission of aggravated assault, the aggravated assault of Perez, possession of a firearm during the commission of each of the crimes against Perez, and a violation of the Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act for participation in a criminal street gang during the commission of the crimes.\nOn July 16, 2012, Daniels was sentenced to life in prison for felony murder and prison terms totaling 35 years for the crimes that were not merged or vacated. On the same day, Thomas was sentenced to life in prison for felony murder, and prison terms totaling 190 years, to be served both consecutively and concurrently, for the crimes that were not merged or vacated.\nOn June 11, 2012, Daniels filed a motion for a new trial, which he amended on Dec. 29, 2014. The motion, as amended, was denied on April 28, 2016. Thomas filed a motion for a new trial on Aug. 6, 2012, which he amended on Oct. 17, 2014. Thomas' motion, as amended, was denied on Nov. 13, 2015.\nDaniels filed a notice of appeal on April 4, 2016, and Thomas filed his notice of appeal on Dec. 8, 2015. The appeals were docketed in the state Supreme Court for the April 2017 term.\nThe Georgia Department of Corrections offender query system lists Daniels as serving a life sentence at Wheeler Correctional Facility. Thomas is serving a life sentence at Ware State Prison.\n___ (c)2017 The Albany Herald, Ga.
