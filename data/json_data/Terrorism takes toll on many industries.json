    "full text": "Industry upon industry is feeling the economic impact of terrorism.\nEconomists say the effect will ease long term, but the disaster spells short-term trouble for a sluggish economy.\n * Domestic airlines have lost $ 275 million a day in revenue since flying was interrupted Tuesday, $ 370 million a day when international airlines are included, according to Back Aviation Solutions. The International Air Transport Association said immediate global revenue losses and extra costs will be $ 10 billion.\n* 2001 was already shaping up to be a lousy year for the hotel industry. Now, revenue will decline up to 5% for the year, the worst performance in 33 years, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. As conventions are canceled and already slow travel grinds to a halt, the drop in the second half of 2001 will be 7% to 10%.\n * Stores everywhere, including shopping centers and 3,700 Starbucks, closed for a day or more. Retail spending, already headed downward, will worsen in this atmosphere of grief and anger, says Kurt Barnard of Barnard's Retail Trend Report.\n * Insurance warnings are pouring in. Chubb expects to pay $ 100 million to $ 200 million on property claims alone. American International Group says its losses from the attack will total about $ 500 million.\n * Stock trading has been shut down until Monday. Last year, $ 32 trillion traded on the New York, American and Nasdaq markets, or more than $ 120 billion a day, according to the Securities Industry Association.\n * There will be no games in 31 NFL stadiums this weekend. Revenue will likely be recovered later, but for now the league is losing more than $ 6 million a game.\n * Broadcast networks and affiliates have lost about $ 100 million a day in ad revenue from the wall-to-wall news coverage with no commercials. That does not include cable TV.\n * Corporate profits were already headed down but will fall 2.9% in the fourth quarter for S&P 500 companies vs. the 2.6% that was expected on Tuesday, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.\nIn the long term, though, Diane Swonk, chief economist of Bank One, says rebuilding and new government spending will pump up the economy. Gross domestic product could grow 3% by the second quarter of 2002, she says.\n***\nContributing: Michael McCarthy, Michael Hiestand\n\nLoad-Date: September 14, 2001"
