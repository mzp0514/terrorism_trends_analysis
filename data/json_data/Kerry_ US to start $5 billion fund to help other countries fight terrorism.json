You have to push the envelope.\"\n\"This is not an abandonment of Afghanistan,\" Kerry said. \"This is an emboldenment. This is an empowerment of Afghanistan.\"\nAppearing on \"CBS This Morning,\" he said the withdrawal plan of the U.S. will allow this country to divert resources to the anti-terrorism fight in other parts of the world. Kerry said U.S. foreign policy needs to reflect a \"rapidly changing, more complex world where terrorism is the principal challenge.\"\nKerry called the Afghanistan troop withdrawal announcement \"a statement of transition\" and said that \"if you tell the Afghans we'll be here as long as it takes, you can absolutely bet your bottom dollar they'll take as long as they want.\" The secretary also said \"it is exactly what the American people have always sought in Afghanistan\" and said \"the Afghans want us to transition out.\"\n\nLoad-Date: May 28, 2014"
