Casey's resignation are predictable reactions to the disclosure of the C.I.A.-sponsored handbook on terrorism supplied to Nicaraguan contras.\nThe buck must stop somewhere, but a resignation or two in the C.I.A. will likely only distract us from the realization that some covert actions are inherently uncontrollable.\nProf Harry Howe Ransom letter on disclosure of CIA-sponsored handbook on terrorism for Nicaraguans; urges covert action be removed as CIA function\nIn ''Present at the Creation,'' Dean Acheson reports that in 1947, when he was Under Secretary of State and the C.I.A. was created, he had ''the gravest forebodings about this organization.'' Acheson says he ''warned the President that as set up neither he, the National Security Council, nor anyone else would be in a position to know what it was doing or to control it.'' Acheson's prophetic wisdom now demands our urgent attention. Covert action should be removed as a C.I.A. function and placed on a shelf, to be used only when a consensus exists that the nation's survival is threatened.\n \nHARRY HOWE RANSOM Nashville, Oct. 20, 1984\nThe writer, professor of political science at Vanderbilt University, wrote ''The Intelligence Establishment.''"
