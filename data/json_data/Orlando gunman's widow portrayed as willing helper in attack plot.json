No one knew except for two people: Omar Mateen and his wife,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney James Mandolfo said in opening statements at Noor Salman's trial in Orlando. \"The defendant gave Omar Mateen the green light to commit terrorism on behalf of ISIS.\"\nMandolfo described Salman, 31, as a person fully aware of Mateen's plot, including his purchase of ammunition for his AR-15, and who had helped him scout possible locations to attack. She also knew his plans when he left the house on June 12, 2016, he said.\nAnd Salman - charged with aiding and abetting the support of a foreign terrorist organization and obstruction of justice - lied to and tried to mislead FBI agents, Mandolfo argued, including withholding information on Ma-teen's fascination with violent jihadist videos and terrorism. If convicted, Sal-man faces up to life in prison.\nLinda Moreno, the defense attorney, challenged the prosecutor's portrait of Salman as a willing helper, saying Mateen had a secret life that involved cheating with other women and exploring jihadist websites.\nShe portrayed Salman as a simple woman with a limited intellect who was duped by her husband and coerced into confessing by the FBI.\nSalman was questioned by authorities, and her story changed multiple times, prosecutors said. In the end, she signed a statement that outlined her knowledge of Mateen's planning and said she knew he was going to attack the club when he left their home.\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nLoad-Date: March 15, 2018"
