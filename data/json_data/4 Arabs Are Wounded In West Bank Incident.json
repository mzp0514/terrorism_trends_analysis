Israeli officials, who described the Hebron attack as an act of terrorism, said they had no information on the identity of the gunmen.\nArab demands that militant Jewish settlers in the West Bank be disarmed were rejected today by the Israeli Chief of Staff, Lieut.

Anyone using them illegally will have to be dealt with, he added.\nArab and Israeli officials reported additional rock-throwing attacks on traffic in Jenin, Kalandia, Nablus and other West Bank towns. The most sensitive localities - Hebron, Halhul and the casbah of Nablus - were under curfew.\n \n----\n \nSpecial to the New York Times\nCAIRO, July 27 - Egypt's Foreign Ministry said today in a statement that the Israeli Government was responsible for the safety of West Bank Palestinians and was thus ultimately to blame for the terrorist attack in Hebron."
