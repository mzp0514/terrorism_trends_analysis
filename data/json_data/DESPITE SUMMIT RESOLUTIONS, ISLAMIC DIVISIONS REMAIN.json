    "full text": "CASABLANCA, Morocco (AP) _ Although the world's\nMuslim leaders were able to patch over differences and issue a public\nstatement against Islamic extremism, the divisions within the Islamic\nworld make containing fanaticism merely a tempting mirage.\nThe statement was among the resolutions made at last week's\nsummit of the 52-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference which\nbrought together leaders from the Middle East, Europe and Asia,\nsporting business suits, turbans or sabers.\n\"The summit once again saved face,\" said Antoine Sfeir,\npublisher of the Paris-based \"Les Cahiers d'Orient,\" a review on\nArab and Islamic affairs.  \"In fact, the breakages and divisions\nremain the same.\"\nMany of the conference's resolutions were on causes that would\nnot offend any member, such as the plight of Bosnian Muslims and\nMuslims in Kashmir.\nThe leaders, however, broke new ground on one of the trickiest\nissues _ confronting the problem of Islamic extremism which has been\nrolling like a wave across the Islamic map.\nIt was a display of deft diplomacy that defied the realities of\nthe Muslim world.\nNations such as the westward-looking Morocco, staunchly\nfundamentalist Saudi Arabia and Sudan and Iran _ both accused of\nfomenting extremism in neighboring states _ joined in a final\ndeclaration calling for an \"illuminated Islam exempt of extremism or\nfanaticism\" and condemning state-sponsored terrorism.\n\"Today, after playing the sorcerer's apprentice, many countries\nsee dangers within their own borders |e movements that contest the\nregime,\" said Sfeir.\nFrom North Africa to Malaysia and the Philippines, Muslim\nmilitants are making inroads or fighting armed battles to topple\ntheir governments.\nIn Algeria, more than 11,000 people have been killed in an\nIslamic insurgency trying to topple the military-backed government\n.  Militants are active in Egypt, Jordan and Oman.  Even in tightly\ncontrolled Saudi Arabia, seat of Islam's holiest site, Mecca,\nextremists are stirring.\nSummit host King Hassan II of Morocco introduced the sensitive\nsubject in a measured address that put the focus on the image of\nIslam which most Muslim nations consider maligned by the West.\nBut he turned the thesis of Western plots on its head, blaming\nextremism for \"prompting fierce campaigns against Islam.\"\nBoth Sudan's leader, Gen. Omar al-Bachir, and Iranian Foreign\nMinister Ali Akbar Velayati, who headed his delegation, denied any\nconnections with militant groups or state-sponsored terrorism.\n\"The Islamic government in Iran is one of the victims of\nterrorism,\" Valayati said in an interview with The Associated Press\nand APTV.  He was referring to bombings that have killed citizens and\nofficials in the 15 years since the Islamic revolution.  The bombings\nhave been blamed on the Baghdad-based opposition group, the\nMujahedeen Khalq.\n\"If you think that Iran is isolated, I tell you very frankly\nthis is the dream of some Western countries.\"\nIrony was the order of the day and tact was the tenet for the\nuncommon banding together, which was not without compromise.\nA resolution _ co-sponsored by Iran _ condemned \"international\nterrorism\" but failed to mention Islamic extremism.  And the Iranian\ncapital, Tehran, was chosen as the next summit site in three years'\ntime.\nThe resolution \"is against terrorism imposed on Muslim\ncountries from the outside, not inside,\" Velayati insisted.\n\"That's a very delicate difference.\"\nThe goal of Islamic leaders is to create a bloc that gives the\nMuslim world's more than 1 billion people a voice in the changing\nworld order.  But there is common agreement that that dream is a long\nway off.\n\"The Islamic world is weak and divided,\" Pakistan's prime\nminister, Benazir Bhutto, said in a blunt admission at an OIC\nministerial meeting this fall.\nEgyptian President Hosni Mubarak blamed Muslims \"blinded by\nignorance and greed\" for \"wasting a chance in drawing the world map\n.\"\nBut the full explanation is more complex.\nMany Islamic countries are currently clients of the West or\nallied with Western powers in a delicate balance of security.\nAnd then there are the often rancorous differences.\nSfeir noted the caricature often used to portray Islamic summits\n_ a portrait of Muslim leaders, their arms clasped behind each other\nin apparent friendship, accompanied by a portrait taken from behind,\nand showing daggers in each others' backs.\nGanley has been based in Paris since 1984, covering France and\nNorth Africa and the fundamentalist movements there.\n\nLoad-Date: January 30, 1995"
