    "full text": "WASHINGTON -- Public support for President Bush and satisfaction with the progress of the war on terrorism remain high, a USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll shows.\nSolid majorities are confident that the United States will remove the Taliban from power in Afghanistan and capture or kill Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\nThe poll, taken Friday through Sunday, finds strong support not only for Bush's handling of the war, but also for his management of the economy and his response to the anthrax scare.\nAnd despite news reports last week that the lack of clear results so far and mounting deaths of civilians in Afghanistan might erode public patience, the poll shows that 79% say they are satisfied with the progress of the war.\n\"Journalists listen to the media pundits and talking heads, but the public has a way of screening them out,\" says Robert Lichter of the Center for Media and Public Affairs.\nHowever, there is some softness in that satisfaction.\nMost say they are only somewhat satisfied with the progress of the war, suggesting that it will take more tangible successes to make them believers.\n\"We need to go in there and get the job done.  . . .  The longer this drags on, the more people are going to hate us,\" says Louann Johnson, 62, a consultant on Indian affairs in Pearson, Ga.\nBush's overall job approval stands at 87%, virtually unchanged since the attacks 8 weeks ago, after which his approval rating soared from 51% to a record high of 90%.\nThree of four also approve of his handling of recent anthrax threats, and seven of 10 back his management of the economy.\nThe poll was taken shortly after reports last Friday that 400,000 Americans lost jobs last month and that unemployment has reached 5.4%, a 5-year high. The president's approval rating on the economy question suggests that the rallying effect of the war effort goes beyond war-related issues.\n\"History tells us that we're still at a point in a national crisis when the public is going to stand behind any president,\" Lichter says.\nAs the bombing in Afghanistan intensifies and prospects mount for a sizable invasion by U.S. ground troops, approval for the war effort shows little sign of eroding.\nMore than eight of 10 back the overall operation there -- seven of 10 say they strongly approve -- and two of three favor sending large numbers of ground troops into battle.\nClearly, much of the public patience to stay the course is being driven by deep anger resulting from the deaths of several thousand people in the attacks on New York and Washington.\n\"They killed us, didn't they? Lack of progress? Then bomb them some more; blanket bomb them. It's fine with me,\" says Tom Flynn, 49, a mechanic in Scranton, Pa.\nMajorities also say they are confident that the United States will remove the Taliban from power in Afghanistan, destroy all terrorist operations there and capture or kill bin Laden. But that confidence has varying degrees of strength, suggesting that some uncertainty will remain until measurable results are produced.\nAlthough anti-war protests are being staged and more forums focus on civilians killed in the bombing, those who favor only a diplomatic or economic solution to the terrorism war show no sign of increasing their influence:\n * 89% of poll respondents say the government should use military force to combat terrorism.\n * 6% say it should use only diplomatic or economic efforts.\nThe poll also shows that the public is growing more comfortable with warnings of new terrorist attacks, despite critics' charges that the vague warnings do little more than scare people.\nTwo weeks ago, 47% said the warnings helped people, and 49% said they only scared people. Now, 55% say they help; 40% say they only frighten. And rather than drop them, seven of 10 say public alerts should be continued, even if no details can be released.\nAt the same time, people's worries about whether they or someone in their family will become a victim of a terrorist attack appear to be easing:\n * Three days after the Sept. 11 attacks, 51% said they were very or somewhat worried.\n * In early October, when anthrax scares surfaced, that number jumped to 59%\n * Now, the percentage of those worried about becoming victims has shrunk to 40%. And 31% say they are not worried at all.\nSupport for Bush's handling of war is strong\nDo you approve of the way President Bush has handled the following?\nU.S. military action abroad to fight terrorism 87%\nEfforts to prevent future terrorism in the USA in general 85%\nThe response to the recent incidents involving anthrax 75%\nThe economy 71%\nHow worried are you that you or someone in your family will become the victim of a terrorist attack?\nSept. 11\nNow\nVery worried\n23%\n10%\nSomewhat worried\n35%\n30%\nNot too worried\n24%\n28%\nNot worried at all\n16%\n31%\nHow likely is it that there will be further acts of terrorism in the United States over the next several weeks?\nOct. 19-21\nNow\nVery likely\n40%\n24%\nSomewhat likely\n45%\n50%\nNot too likely\n10%\n16%\nNot at all likely\n3%\n6%\nIf the government believes a terrorist attack might occur, but it can't release details, which would be better?\nIssue an alert without any details 71%\nNot issue an alert at all 26%\nWhat do you think the effect has been of the government warnings of further terrorist attacks?\nThey have helped people 55%\nThey just scared people 40%\nDo you approve or disapprove of the current U.S. military action in Afghanistan?\nApprove 86%\nDisapprove 11%\nDo you favor or oppose the United States sending large numbers of ground troops into combat in Afghanistan?\nFavor 66%\nOppose 28%\nHow satisfied are you with the progress made by the U.S. military in the war in Afghanistan?\nVery satisfied 27%\nSomewhat satisfied 52%\nNot too satisfied 11%\nNot at all satisfied 7%\nHow confident are you that the United States will do the following?\nVery confident\nSomewhat confident\nRemove the Taliban from power\n42%\n41%\nCapture or kill Osama bin Laden\n27%\n39%\nDestroy all terrorist operations in Afghanistan\n17%\n45%\nSource: USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll of 1,012 adults Friday-Sunday.
