They included U\n.S. allegations that Syria is looking the other way on drug\ntrafficking in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley and concern for increased\ncounterfeiting of $ 100 bills in Syria.  Also on Christopher's list of\nissues were two perennial topics _ terrorism and human rights.\nThe Clinton administration, in a report to Congress, credits\nSyria with an improved record on both counts.  Officials said Syria's\nrecord continued to improve this year.  But the report, which covers\n1993, keeps Syria on a list of seven countries promoting terrorism\nChristopher also is seeking a detailed account from Assad and\nForeign Minister Farouk Sharaa of a new arms deal concluded last week\nwith Russia.  Christopher wants to know if Syria will be getting\nmissiles from Moscow and if so, of what range.\nRussian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets has said Russia\nintends to continue to develop military, technology, energy and trade\nties forged in the past between Syria and the Soviet Union.\nSyria, with Soviet help, became a potent military power in the\nregion, and also adopted a tough line toward Israel.  The Clinton\nadministration believes that stance is changing since the demise of\nthe Soviet empire.\n\nLoad-Date: January 31, 1995"
