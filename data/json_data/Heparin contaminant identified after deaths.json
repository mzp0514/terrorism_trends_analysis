Chondroitin sulfate is a natural compound that occurs widely and is used as a dietary supplement, but the oversulfated version has not been studied widely. \nBush names choice for homeland security post\n WASHINGTON - President Bush yesterday named a veteran prosecutor, Ken Wainstein, as his homeland security adviser.\n From the White House, Wainstein will coordinate efforts \"to ensure that we continue to make progress on combating terrorism, securing our borders and strengthening our emergency preparedness,\" Bush said in a statement yesterday.\n Wainstein now heads the Justice Department's anti-terrorism efforts.
