    "full text": "The scenario was of a smallpox outbreak concocted by terrorists at a basketball tournament downtown. The drill was to learn how well and quickly hospitals in the St. Louis area would deal with it.\nThe St. Louis Area Regional Response System helped to organize the practice with 22 hospitals in Missouri and 18 in Illinois. Hospital staff members were given details of the hypothetical outbreak Thursday morning and then instructed to say how they would respond if the situation were real.\nOn Wednesday, participants discussed plans with fire and public health officials.\nDr. Karen Webb, chairwoman of the Response System and chief medical officer at St. Louis University Hospital, said the point was to test how well individual hospitals would treat a sudden influx of smallpox patients and how quickly they could develop a common response.\n\"We have to work together as a community of hospitals to identify an outbreak and then deal with it effectively,\" Webb said. \"Key issues are recognizing what it is, properly reporting it and getting the resources here.\"\nSmallpox, a deadly viral disease, has all but been eradicated worldwide. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security considers it plausible that terrorists could obtain quantities of smallpox virus for use as a \"biological weapon.\" Many hospitals and medical-emergency agencies have had employees vaccinated for smallpox.\nIn the scenario written by Bill Stanhope, of the St. Louis University School of Public Health's bioterrorism institute, terrorists released smallpox virus through the heating and cooling system of Savvis Center during a high school basketball tournament. Because symptoms don't immediately appear, the test assumed that the first patients went to hospitals with flulike systems four days later.\nWebb said participants would meet again on Nov. 10 to review their work.\n\nLoad-Date: October 29, 2004"
