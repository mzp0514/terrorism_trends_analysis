    "full text": "It's commonly assumed that terrorism is spawned by poverty that drives frustrated young men to violence. Leaders of 50 nations underscored this view in 2002 during a summit at Monterrey, Mexico. The World Trade Organization's chief said: \"Poverty in all its forms is the greatest threat to peace, security.\"\nBut we doubt this conclusion, because extremely poor Third World places aren't wracked by suicide bombings and the like. Nor are such horrors limited exclusively to Muslim lands, because they're also perpetrated by Hindus in Sri Lanka, Basques in Spain, etc.\nNow a National Science Foundation study supports the same view. In announcing the findings, NSF official Nancy Lutz said: \"People say 'poverty breeds terrorism,' and that seems obvious, but when one looks at the data, it has to be questioned if it's really true. In fact, the data tell us there's no link between poverty and terrorism, which suggests that attempts to reduce terrorism by fighting poverty will not work.\"\nThe biggest cause of terrorist gore, the NSF concluded, is lack of political freedom - not total lack, as in totalitarian nations that crush all dissent, but partial suppression in places where hope for improvement is stymied.\nThe study's director, Dr. Alberto Abadie of Harvard University, pointed out that his native Basque region in Spain is affluent, but has been shattered by a half-century of violence by Basque extremists thwarted in their drive for independence.\n\"Countries with higher levels of political freedom tend to have lower levels of terrorism,\" he said.\nSo, if the NSF is correct, democracy and equality are the best antidotes for this curse upon the 21st century.\n\nLoad-Date: March 31, 2008"
