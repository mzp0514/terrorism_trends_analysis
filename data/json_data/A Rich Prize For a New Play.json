    "full text": "A new play titled ''Modern Terrorism'' has been selected for the 2012 Laurents/Hatcher Foundation Award, a generous theater prize that provides $50,000 to the author - in this case, Jon Kern - and an additional $100,000 toward the production costs for the play's premiere. Trustees for the foundation of the writer and director Arthur Laurents (''West Side Story,'' ''Gypsy'') and his partner of 52 years, Tom Hatcher, announced the selection of Mr. Kern on Thursday; he is a graduate of the Columbia University master's program in playwriting as well as the University of Chicago.\nA spokeswoman for the foundation said a few theaters have expressed interest in producing the play, which she described as ''a dark comedy about the difficulties of being a terrorist in the 21st century.'' The theater that mounts the play will receive the $100,000 grant to defray the production costs.\nDavid Saint, president of the foundation and the artistic director of George Street Playhouse, said in a statement that the award selection committee members ''all felt that this play leapt off the page with such an explosively daring and funny new voice, unafraid of confronting volatile issues in our world today, that Arthur would be proud.'' Mr. Kern's play was submitted for considered by his agent at WME.\nThe award was first presented in 2011 to Jeff Talbott for his play ''The Submission,'' with the production money going to MCC Theater, an Off Broadway company that staged the play last fall. Mr. Laurents died last year at age 93; Mr. Hatcher passed away in 2006.\nThis is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: January 21, 2012"
