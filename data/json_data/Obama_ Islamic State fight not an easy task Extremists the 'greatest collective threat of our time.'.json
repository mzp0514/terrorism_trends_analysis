    "full text": "President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro met for the second time this year Tuesday at United Nations headquarters. Speakers at Tuesday's meeting spoke of the need to confront extremism.\nUNITED NATIONS - President Barack Obama on Tuesday pledged all possible tools - military, intelligence and economic - to defeat the Islamic State group, but acknowledged the extremist group has taken root in Syria and Iraq, is resilient and continues to expand.\nObama hosted a U.N. gathering of world leaders working to expand the battle against terrorism, a day after he and the leaders of Russia, China and Iran addressed the General Assembly during its 70th anniversary. The fight against terrorism, particularly in Syria, has seized the attention of top officials, but there has been no overall agreement on how to end the conflict there.\n\"I have repeatedly said that our approach will take time. This is not an easy task,\" Obama cautioned, while adding that he was \"ultimately optimistic\" the brutal organization would be defeated because it has nothing to offer but suffering and death.\n\"This is a long-term campaign - not only against this particular network, but against its ideology,\" he said.\nThe meeting also heard from the Iraqi leader, who sought more help against the Islamic State in his country, and learned from Obama that three more countries - Nigeria, Tunisia and Malaysia - were added to the coalition fighting the group.\nThe fight against terrorism has been complicated by a Russian military buildup in Syria in support of President Bashar Assad. Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested Monday that Russia could launch airstrikes against the militants in Syria, if sanctioned by the United Nations or requested by Damascus.\nObama and Putin are at odds over Russian involvement because Washington has said Assad must be removed from power. Obama and Putin laid out competing visions for Syria during their U.N. speeches Monday.\nReflecting the divide, an official with the Russian delegation said Moscow was taking part in the Obama-led event with a lower-level official, U.N. deputy ambassador Evgeny Zagaynov.\nOne by one, speakers at Tuesday's meeting spoke of the need to confront the extremism that Jordan's King Abdullah II described as the \"greatest collective threat of our time.\"\nBan, the U.N. chief, said the U.N.'s most recent data shows a 70 percent increase in foreign terrorist fighters from more than 100 countries to regions in conflict.\n\nLoad-Date: September 30, 2015"
