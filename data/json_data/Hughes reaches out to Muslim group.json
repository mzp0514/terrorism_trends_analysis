Her tasks include improving the U.S. image in Muslim countries.\n\"We need to foster a sense of common interest and common values among Americans and people of different faiths and different cultures,\" she said at a news conference. \"Frankly, who better to do that than many of our American Muslims themselves, who have friends and families and roots in countries across our world.\"\nThe Indiana-based ISNA is an umbrella association of U.S. and Canadian Muslim groups and mosques. Its convention comes a month after U.S. Muslim scholars issued a fatwa, or religious edict, condemning terrorism after deadly attacks in London and Egypt.\n\"The fatwasays that there is no justification in Islam for terrorism. Those are words the entire world needs to hear,\" Hughes said.\nISNA yesterday unveiled a brochure outlining the Islamic position against terrorism and religious extremism. It states that terrorism \"is the epitome of injustice because it targets innocent people.\"\nKareem Irfan led the committee that produced the brochure and will launch other initiatives to promote what ISNA calls \"balanced Islam.\" Despite \"crystal-clear statements stating the position of Islam and Muslims\" against terrorism, there remain \"inklings of doubt from segments of society,\" he said.\n\nLoad-Date: September 3, 2005"
