    "full text": "BAGHDAD - Suicide attackers detonated three car bombs in quick succession near foreign embassies in Baghdad on Sunday, killing more than 40 people in coordinated strikes that Iraqi officials said were intended to disrupt efforts to form a new government.\nThe bombings followed the execution-style killings of 24 villagers in a Sunni area two days earlier, a spike in violence that suggests insurgents are seizing on the political uncertainty after the recent election to try to destabilize the country as U.S. troops prepare to leave. No clear winner emerged from the March 7 vote.\nSunday's explosions went off within minutes of one another, starting shortly after 11 a.m.\nOne struck near the Iranian Embassy, and two others hit an area that houses several diplomatic missions, including the Egyptian Consulate and the German and Spanish embassies. It was not immediately known whether diplomatic staff were among the victims.\nAuthorities said they foiled two other attacks aimed at diplomatic targets by stopping the would-be bombers' vehicles and defusing the explosives.\n\"I saw children screaming,\" Hassan Karim, 32, who owns a clothing shop in Baghdad, said. \"Cars were crashing into each other in streets, trying to find a way to flee.\"\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility, although multiple, coordinated bombings in the capital are a hallmark of al-Qaida in Iraq.\nThe violence suggests insurgents are trying to regroup in the political vacuum left after the elections.\nFormer Prime Minister Ayad Allawi's cross-sectarian bloc tapped into heavy Sunni support to come in just two seats ahead of the mainly Shiite list of the incumbent, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. But neither side has enough seats to govern alone, which means they are scrambling to cobble together enough parliamentary support to form a government.\nIraq's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the bombings were an attempt to inject more turmoil into the political scene as the election front-runners try to forge a coalition government.\n\"These terrorists will not be able to stop Iraqis and friends of the Iraqi people from building a free, secure and prosperous future,\" the ministry said.\n\nLoad-Date: April 6, 2010"
