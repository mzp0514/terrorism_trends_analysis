Five people were killed as the protests turned violent.\nThe casualties were the result of running street battles that lasted hours, during which police fired live rounds and tear gas.\nThe raid on the city&apos;s Eastleigh neighborhood was carried out by the elite General Service Unit and anti-terrorism police following claims by Kenyan Internal Security Minister George Saitoti that Somali militant Islamist group al-Shabab infiltrated into Friday&apos;s demonstration.\nAl-Faisal is on an international terrorism watch-list, and many countries, including the United States, regard al- Shabaab as a terrorist organization with links to al-Qaeda.\nKenya&apos;s Muslim leadership distanced itself from Al-Faisal, demanding that his deportation be completed, but many countries have refused to issue transit visas to the 45-year-old cleric who called on his followers to kill Jews and Hindus.\nAl-Shabaab launched an offensive from south Mogadishu vowing to topple the UN-backed government in Somalia, alleging that President Sheikh Sharif Ahmed is too close to the West.\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\nCopyright(c) 2010 RTTNews.com, Inc.
