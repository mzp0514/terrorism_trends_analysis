    "full text": "Attorney General John Ashcroft's \"Mobilization Against Terrorism Act\" contains many provisions that undermine or outright eliminate fundamental due process and privacy rights all people in America enjoy.\n The proposal creates a mechanism for the arrest, detention and deportation of aliens on mere suspicion alone, without a hearing or the right to confront the evidence, with very, very limited rights to challenge the detention and deportation order in court and no right to challenge the orders administratively.\nMoreover, the proposal permits application of these procedures to any alien in the United States for any act, or suspected activity, no matter when it took place. There are other provisions that wipe away many of our privacy rights by expanding wiretap and other electronic and regular surveillance authority and which impose very severe criminal penalties for actions as simple as running and hiding from the Border Patrol.\n Americans and all the civilized people of the world agree that terrorism must be eradicated, and the reasons terrorists turn to their means and devices studied and understood. But in the effort to stop terrorism and to protect ourselves, we should not by our own hand eliminate the rights and freedoms we cherish, have fought to win and have died to defend. If we do so, the terrorists will have won.\n ROBERT P. DEASY\n Deasy & Whitehill\n Downtown\n\nNotes\n\nEditor's note: The writer is an immigration lawyer.\n\nLoad-Date: September 24, 2001"
