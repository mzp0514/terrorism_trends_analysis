    "full text": "LOS ANGELES -- An Algerian man was convicted Friday of terrorism for bringing a car loaded with explosives into the United States in what authorities said was a global plan to bomb buildings at the time of millennium celebrations.\nAhmed Ressam, 33, stood silently with his eyes downcast as a clerk read the federal court jury's verdict guilty of nine federal charges including an act of terrorism transcending a national boundary.\nDefense attorney Michael Filipovic said, \"We're obviously disappointed with the results. There will be an appeal.\"\nHe said of Ressam, \"He's obviously upset with the result.\"\nSentencing was scheduled for June 28 in Seattle. The charges carry a maximum penalty of 130 years in prison.\nIt was Ressam's second conviction of the day. Earlier, in Paris, a French court convicted and sentenced him for belonging to support network for Islamic militants.\nRessam was arrested on Dec. 14, 1999, by U.S. Customs inspectors at Port Angeles after arriving on a ferry from Canada.\nProsecutors alleged that bomb-making materials found in his rental car were intended for attacks on West Coast sites, possibly during millennium celebrations. However, they did not try to prove specific targets.\nRessam's defense called him an unwitting courier and blamed co-defendant Abdelmajid Dahoumane, who is in custody in Algeria and will be tried there on charges of participating in terrorist organizations.\nIn Paris, Ressam was given a five-year prison sentence after being tried in absentia. That trial drew a picture of a web of Islamic militants with unclear connections who cross paths around the world.\n\nLoad-Date: April 8, 2001"
