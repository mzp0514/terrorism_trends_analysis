    "full text": "The driver of a stolen pickup truck carrying a homemade bomb crashed through the doors of the county courthouse and ignited an accelerant on board, causing a fire that heavily damaged the building.\nThe bomb did not explode, nobody was injured and the driver fled in what authorities called a terrorist attack on the Tippecanoe County Courthouse Sunday night.\nYesterday, authorities were searching for suspects and a motive.\n\"Anytime somebody drives a truck into the courthouse and tries to do damage to it, I think that falls under the definition of terrorism,\" Sheriff David Murtaugh said.\nThe driver crashed the truck through two sets of plate-glass doors and drove about 40 feet into the courthouse before igniting the fire, Murtaugh said. The driver then fled.\nMurtaugh said he could think of no way the vehicle could accidentally have crashed because it had to pass through a narrow passage flanked by two staircases to reach the doors.\nThe beat-up, red 1979 Ford pickup truck had been reported stolen to Lafayette police last week. The sheriff said the owner of the truck is cooperating with the investigation.\nPolice were working on a composite sketch of a possible suspect, a man seen near the courthouse shortly after the fire started.\n\nLoad-Date: October 17, 2002"
