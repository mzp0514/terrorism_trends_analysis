    "full text": "To the Editor:\nIn a case brought by Nicaragua before the International Court of Justice, the United States argued that the contra war is a ''collective self-defense'' of Central American countries against Nicaraguan aggression. The Court examined and rejected this argument, and on June 27, 1986, ruled that United States aid to the contras is a violation of international law.\nNow Ernesto Palazio, Washington representative of the contras, says (letter, April 4) that the reason the contras are fighting is to bring democracy to Nicaragua.\nPolitically impartial human-rights organizations like Americas Watch, Amnesty International and the nonsectarian religious group Witness for Peace report that the contras commit systematic atrocities, concentrating their attacks on people like teachers and health workers. Americas Watch and Witness for Peace state that it is contra policy to use terrorism against civilians so that they will be afraid to cooperate with the Government; that the contras routinely murder, torture, rape and mutilate their victims.\nMr. Palazio writes about democracy and human rights, while the most recent Americas Watch report (news article, Feb. 10) says the contra program of deliberate atrocities continues unabated. Terrorism doesn't bring democracy to anyone.\nWe are sponsoring terrorism in Nicaragua, in violation of our own moral standards and of international law.\n \nEDGAR VILLCHUR\nWoodstock, N.Y., April 6, 1987"
