    "full text": "The Bush administration has used the Patriot Act's powers to listen to cell phone conversations and examine business records 84 times in 31/2 years, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said Tuesday as Congress began considering whether to renew those powers and other sections of the anti-terror law.\nGonzales and FBI Director Robert Mueller urged lawmakers to make permanent all 15 expiring provisions of the law, some of which have aroused civil liberties concerns. Mueller also asked lawmakers to expand the bureau's ability to obtain records in terrorism cases without first asking a judge or grand jury.\n\"Al-Qaida and other groups remain a grave threat to our country, and now is not the time for us to relinquish our tools in that fight,\" Gonzales told the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nSeveral lawmakers are introducing legislation Wednesday to curb major parts of the Patriot Act. Their bill would limit so-called \"roving wiretaps\" that allow authorities to monitor a suspect's cell phones and would raise the standard of proof the government has to meet before getting secret warrants to examine business records.\nAn unusual coalition of groups, including the American Conservative Union and the liberal-leaning American Civil Liberties Union, is backing the new legislation.\nThough the Patriot Act prompts strong reactions, the hearing was remarkably subdued, with senators praising Gonzales for his willingness to engage in debate. \"That's a grand departure from your predecessor,\" said Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., referring to former Attorney General John Ashcroft.\nGonzales told lawmakers the provisions have been invoked sparingly since the Patriot Act became law in October 2001, just 45 days after the Sept. 11 attacks, expanding the government's surveillance and prosecutorial powers against suspected terrorists, their associates and financiers.\nAuthorities have sought roving wiretaps 49 times and business records 35 times, Gonzales said. All the business-record warrants were issued since September 2003.\nThe government never has used the provision permitting secret warrants for \"books, records, papers, documents and other items\" to obtain library, bookstore, medical or gun sale records, he said.\nBut when asked by committee Chairman Arlen Specter, R-Pa., whether the administration would agree to exclude library and medical records from the law, Gonzales demurred. \"It should not be held against us that we have exercised restraint,\" he said.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nMug - Alberto Gonzales\n\nLoad-Date: April 6, 2005"
