    "full text": "The Senate approved a bill Tuesday to help allay the costs of terrorism insurance, setting up a showdown with the House over how to help businesses survive possible future disasters. President George W. Bush warned that he wanted the final measure to include protections against \"predatory lawsuits.\"\nThe Democratic-controlled Senate approved the bill by a vote of 84-14, sending it to a House-Senate conference committee and beginning a new fight over a final version to send to the president. All senators from Missouri and Illinois voted to pass the bill.\nThe House approved its own version of the bill last year, and the two sides will now get together and try to hammer out their differences.\nDemocrats say there is room for compromise with House Republicans. \"The president wants this bill, the House wants this bill, we want this bill,\" said Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev.\nEarlier Tuesday, Bush showed his desire for the bill, making calls to some senators to help twist arms on a vote to speed the bill's passage. After the vote, Bush applauded Senate passage.\nAfter Sept. 11, many insurers limited or dropped coverage for casualty and property losses to terrorism because insurance companies faced record payouts of $30 billion to $50 billion.\nThe House has passed legislation under which the government would help insurers continue to offer terror insurance by agreeing to pick up, for at least one year, 90 percent of losses in any major attack.\nUnder the Senate bill, the insurance industry would have to pay $10 billion of insurance costs for terror attacks for two years. Beyond that level, the government would cover 90 percent with the insurance industry paying the remaining 10 percent.\n\nNotes\n\nWAR ON TERROR\n\nLoad-Date: June 19, 2002"
