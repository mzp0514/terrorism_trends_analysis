    "full text": "A Manhattan federal judge ruled that the First Amendment applies to robust paid political speech on public transit.\nAt issue was advertising by the American Freedom Defense Initiative - strongly backing Israel and opposing Palestinian terrorism - that the group wanted to put on buses.\nIt read: \"In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel. Defeat Jihad.\" Some will agree with that message. Others will find it oversimplifying, even abhorrent. (The group is run by Pamela Geller, who often engages in irresponsible attacks on Muslims.)\nThe MTA rejected the ad - citing a policy that expressly prohibits communications that might demean groups on the basis of race, religion or other characteristics.\nBut political communication is provocative by its very nature. It is sometimes unpleasant.\nWhat's critical is that a quasi-public square like the MTA does not apply arbitrary standards to choose what's allowed and what's verboten.\nIn a wise ruling, Judge Paul Engelmayer wrote that \"whatever weight might be assigned to the governmental interest in banning demeaning speech on the exterior of New York City buses on an evenhanded basis, there is no good reason for protecting some individuals and groups, but not others, from such abuse.\"\nJust right.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nNLVL\n\nLoad-Date: July 23, 2012"
