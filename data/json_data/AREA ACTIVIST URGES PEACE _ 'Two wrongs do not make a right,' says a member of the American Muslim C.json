    "full text": "A Dayton-area member of the American Muslim Council's advisory board said while he does not condone terrorism, the United States' actions Thursday were also misguided.\nBashir G. Ahmed, a Tipp City businessman and activist in the local Muslim community, was glad to hear President Clinton's statement that Thursday's bombings were not aimed against the Islamic religion.\nISLAMBut Ahmed criticized using violence to combat terrorism and advocated using more peaceful means to punish terrorists.\n\"Two wrongs do not make a right,\" he said. \"We are at the stage where we don't know what the evidence is. If it is true these people in these countries are responsible, then we need to bring them to justice through the justice system.\"\nAhmed noted the United States reacts aggressively to terrorism from Muslim countries.\n\"We haven't (bombed terrorists) before in other cases. When Jewish people do that, we don't go and bomb Israel. But it seems when Muslim countries are involved, we take these actions and innocent people are killed,\" he said.\nAhmed also pointed out that the Islamic faith is a peaceful religion.\n\"Basically, we as Muslims, believe any type of terrorism is bad. We cannot condone it whether it is by individuals or state terrorism,\" he said.\n\nNotes\n\n\nTerrorism Under Attack: THE REACTION\n\nLoad-Date: August 22, 1998"
