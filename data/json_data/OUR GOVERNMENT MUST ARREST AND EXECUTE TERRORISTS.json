    "full text": "I am responding to the recent reports appearing in the Post-Gazette regarding acts of terrorism.\nWith the 1995 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people, the recent truck bombing that claimed the lives of 19 American servicemen in Saudi Arabia, the explosion of TWA Flight 800 killing all 230 on board and a bomb blast at Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta which claimed the life of one spectator, it's quite clear that there is a new surge of terrorism against Americans at home and abroad.\nMy prayers go out to all of the victims and their grieving families and friends.\nHow can the United States better combat terrorism - a serious threat to our national security?  The president and members of Congress could approve legislation for larger funds to beef up the CIA, FBI and Delta Force personnel to help expose and arrest domestic and foreign terrorists before their evil plots can kill or injure any more people.\nA recent news report, based on U.S. intelligence documents, revealed that Iran has set up 11 camps to train foreign terrorists for overseas bombings, assassinations and other clandestine operations. This, along with threats from Muslim militants and other radical groups, further validates the urgency for tougher anti-terrorism legislation.\nLet's hope that the terrorists and their accomplices who are responsible for recent and previous acts of terrorism will be arrested, convicted and sentenced to death.\n\nLoad-Date: September 2, 1996"
