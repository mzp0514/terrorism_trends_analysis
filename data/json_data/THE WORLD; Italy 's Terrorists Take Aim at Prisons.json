    "full text": "By Barbara Slavin and Milt Freudenheim Unable to bring down the Italian state, left-wing terrorists last week focused on that part of it closest to many of their comrades - Italy's maximum-security prisons.\nAbout 70 convicts seized 18 guards at the maximum-security facility in the southwest town of Trani.\nLeft-wing terrorists in Italy demand closing of 10 maximum-security prisonsThey demanded the closing of all 10 such prisons and the transfer of the inmates.\nLast weekend, the Government of Prime Minister Arnaldo Forlani agreed to shut one prison, a former medieval fortress on Asinara Island off Sardinia. Its closure was demanded by Red Brigades who kidnapped Giovanni d'Urso, a Rome magistrate, on Dec. 12.\nThe Government said it had planned to shut the facility because of its age and remoteness, but was stung by charges that it was capitulating to terrorism. It reacted to the revolt at Trani by flying in paramilitary police. They stormed the prison and freed the hostages without loss of life. Later, two Italian journalists were arrested in connection with the publication of an interview with Red Brigades guerrillas.\nThe terrorists kept on shooting. Assassins posing as delivery boys killed Enrico Galvaligi, the Carabinieri general in charge of security in the maximum-security jails, as he and his wife returned from New Year's Eve mass.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nIllustrations: photo of Gen. Enrico Galvaligi"
