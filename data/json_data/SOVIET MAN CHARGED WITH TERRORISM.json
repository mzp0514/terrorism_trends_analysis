    "full text": "MOSCOW (AP) - A man who opened fire in Red Square in the Revolution Day paradehas been charged with committing a terrorist act, a spokesman for the KGB secret police said Thursday.  The man, Alexander A. Shmonov, 38, of Leningrad will undergo psychiatric tests to determine whether he was sane at the time of the shootings Wednesday, said Alexei Kandaurov, deputy director of the KGB public relations office.\nHe gave no further details on the case.  No one was hurt in the incident, in which Shmonov pulled out a hunting rifle in the heavily guarded square about 80 yards from President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev.  A plainclothes officer knocked the weapon away after Shmonov fired once into the air and once into the ground, newspapers said. Shmonov was subdued by about 20 plainclothes officers and carried into the GUM department store across the square from the reviewing stand where Gorbachev and other leaders were standing.  Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze played down the incident as a potential assassination attempt. ''I don't think this incident should be taken very seriously,'' Shevardnadze said. ''This is a huge country, where something is always happening somewhere.'' Shmonov was interrogated and spoke in detail about his preparations for the shootings, the Tass news agency quoted KGB investigator Pyotr Sokolov as saying. Shmonov is charged with committing ''an attempted terrorist act,'' Sokolov said.  KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov indicated Wednesday night that officials believed Shmonov was deranged.\n\nLoad-Date: October 18, 1993"
