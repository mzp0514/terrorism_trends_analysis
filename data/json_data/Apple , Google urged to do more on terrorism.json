Rigby was attacked just after 2 p.m. on May 22, 2013, outside a military barracks in the Woolwich neighborhood of southeast London. Televised images of the bloodshed were transmitted around the world. Adebolajo and Adebowale ran over Rigby, then got out of their car and almost decapitated the unconscious soldier with knives and cleavers, prosecutors said during the trial.\nThe U.K. government plans to introduce anti-terrorism legislation this week requiring Internet companies to provide user data to authorities. Under the proposed law, Internet- service providers will have to retain information on Internet protocol addresses -- a number that identifies individual computer devices -- and supply it to security services on request to help them track users' activities.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nhacktech.com Google Inc., Apple Inc. and other U.S. technology companies were urged to do more to root out terrorists after a report into the 2013 murder of a U.K. soldier uncovered an online message where an Islamist extremist contemplated the attack.\n\nLoad-Date: December 1, 2014"
