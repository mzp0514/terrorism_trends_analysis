The deal was approved by Lake County Circuit Court Judge Victoria Rossetti.\nPederson, who had already served 328 days in Lake County Jail since his arrest last year, was released from custody Tuesday based on time served, said Cynthia Vargas, spokeswoman for the Lake County State's Attorney's Office. She added that Pederson had a flight home to California on Tuesday night and his case was transferred to California, where his probation and public service will be served.\nA former resident of Lake County, Pederson was accused of making a threatening call on Sept. 12, 2014, according to authorities, who reported that he said he was going to \"kill people\" and \"light up\" the two public safety facilities. Security was heightened at the downtown Waukegan courthouse the following day.\nPederson was arrested Sept. 25 after authorities said they traced the call back to him. Before the plea deal, he faced 20 to 60 years in prison on two counts of making a terrorist threat. He also had two outstanding warrants in Lake County at the time, a 2011 failure-to-appear warrant for a criminal damage to property charge and a 2013 warrant for allegedly violating an order of protection, according to court records.\nWhen he was indicted on the terrorist threat charges he was also indicted for allegedly violating an order of protection in Vernon Hills in 2013, and five counts of telephone harassment involving a threat to kill in 2012 in Round Lake, police and prosecutors said. He was additionally indicted on electronic harassment charges, according to Chicago Tribune archives.\nfabderholden@tribpub.com\n___ (c)2015 the Lake County News-Sun (Lake County, Ill.)
