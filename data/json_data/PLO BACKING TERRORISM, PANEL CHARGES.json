    "full text": "A House panel accused the PLO Tuesday of \"tacit approval\" of anti-Israeli terrorism. It threatened to block further U.S. aid to the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\nBut Robert Pelletreau, assistant secretary of state for the Middle East, said the Palestinians had demonstrated a readiness to take on the Hamas extremists, who organized a wave of bombings in Israel that have killed about 60 people.\nCiting a State Department report to Congress, Pelletreau said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his administration had outlawed the military wings of extremist Islamic movements and arrested some 700 militants.\nStill, Pelletreau's report on the Palestine Liberation Organization's compliance with the 1993 peace accord with Israel failed to sway members of the House International Relations Committee.\nRep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., who heads the panel, said, \"Rather than taking resolute action to root out the terrorists who have struck in Israel, the Palestinian Authority has made only halfhearted attempts at confiscating weapons.\"\nArafat's \"double-tongued statements have helped to support an environment in which terrorist organizations flourish and recruit because they are led to believe they have the tacit approval of the Palestinian leadership,\" he said.\nRep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., accused Arafat of orchestrating a charade by temporarily detaining some terrorists and setting them free a few weeks later.\n\"What needs to be done by the Palestinian Authority is to pulverize the infrastructure of the terrorists,\" he said.\nTuesday's hearing was part of a congressional review of the PLO's compliance with its September 1993 peace agreement with Israel.\n\nLoad-Date: March 14, 1996"
