One of them had worked for Scotland Yard from 2007 to 2009 as a support officer who patrols the streets but cannot arrest anyone.\nDart was picked up on the street.\nThe former security guard from Dorset, who calls himself Salahuddin, was the subject of a BBC documentary shot by his stepbrother, who was shocked by his radicalization after seeing him for the first time in years .\n\"Some of the first words he said were, 'Look at these filthy Kuffar (non-believers). None of this will be around when Sharia law comes in,\" the stepbrother, Robb Leech, told the website IdeasTap.\ntconnor@nydailynews.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \nOlympic stadium is being built for Games. Nearby, on Thursday, six terror suspects were busted.\n\nLoad-Date: July 8, 2012"
