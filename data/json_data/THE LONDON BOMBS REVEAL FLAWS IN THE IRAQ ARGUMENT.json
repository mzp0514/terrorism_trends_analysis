    "full text": "When Bush supporters are asked why we preemptively struck Iraq, they will tell you terrorism must be stopped. When you point out that Iraq had no link to 9/11, they then argue the people of Iraq deserve to be free.\nWhen you note Bush's hypocrisy in not freeing the peoples of the Sudan, North Korea, Cuba or a host of other countries, they then state that a democratic Iraq is key to a peaceful Middle East.\n When you point out that the European states of the 20th century failed miserably in turning their Middle Eastern colonies into democracies or that America's experiment in nation-building, Vietnam, ended tragically with thousands dead and a communist state, they then answer circularly by claiming, yet again, that terrorism must be stopped.\n Terrorism, however, is not being stopped, as shown by the recent events in London. It has been almost four years since 9/11 and two since we invaded Iraq. Bin Laden is free, young men are dying every day and the terrorism seen in London and Madrid, which is still equally possible here today, continues to occur.\n If only America's educators actually taught how erroneous, ideological thinking leads to events like Vietnam, last year's election may have been different. More importantly, if President Bush actually learned such lessons, he would see the disconnect between his own argument and the actual results of Iraq.\n TIM IANNINI\n Center\n\nLoad-Date: July 14, 2005"
