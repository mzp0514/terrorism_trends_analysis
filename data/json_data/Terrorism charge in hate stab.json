These younger guys that put white girls on the wrong path.\"\nThe former soldier, who served with the Army in Afghanistan, said he'd intended for the killing to be \"a practice run\" - the first step in a larger plan with many more casualties.\nJackson faces life in prison without parole if convicted of the charges filed by the Manhattan district attorney's office Monday. In addition to the terror charge, he faces illegal weapons possession charges.\nHe's due to be arraigned in Manhattan Supreme Court on April 13.\nHis lawyer Sam Talkin declined to comment.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n[James Jackson]\n\nLoad-Date: March 29, 2017"
