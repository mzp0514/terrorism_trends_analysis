He said security issues would \"make or break\" the conference.\nNetanyahu, however, is under intense pressure from Israel's right-wing camp, which opposes ceding land to the Palestinians. On Wednesday, opponents of the U.S. plan, including the powerful Jewish settler lobby, threatened to topple the government and field a challenger to Netanyahu in the next elections if he signs off on a pullback deal with the Palestinians.\nEven two Netanyahu allies, Trade Minister Natan Sharansky and Science Minister Silvan Shalom, said Netanyahu should back out of the summit because unrealistically high expectations for success would pressure Israel into making too many concessions.\nSettlers were demonstrating outside of Netanyahu's home Wednesday and planned to send representatives to the summit to try to convince Israeli leaders to walk away from the talks.\nBut Netanyahu said Wednesday that if Israel's security demands are met, \"we will be willing to go a long way, even very long\" toward a peace agreement.\nPalestinian promises to constrict Hamas, which claims responsibility for several bloody attacks on Israeli civilians, will not suffice, however, Shoval said. \"We have so many general promises we can paper the walls with them,\" he said.\nSpokesmen at the White House and State Department echoed Israel's concerns and condemned the latest incident, an attack that killed one Israeli and wounded another as they swam in a spring on a communal farm outside Jerusalem.\n\"We join him in condemning the violence that took place,\" Joe Lockhart, the president's spokesman, said of Netanyahu's denunciation of the attack.\nMeanwhile, CIA Director George Tenet has been in the region consulting with Israeli and Palestinian officials on tougher security measures.\nState Department spokesman James Rubin said Hamas extremists \"are a threat to everyone in the Middle East,\" including Arafat. \"We have a common enemy, and that is Hamas,\" he said.\nRubin confirmed, meanwhile, that the Clinton administration was \"trying to stitch together a package of measures that will fight terrorism.\"\nShoval, meanwhile, ticked off Israel's demands that illegal weapons be confiscated, terrorist cells uprooted, and terrorist suspects kept in prison.\nShoval also reiterated Israel's demand that the Palestine Liberation Organization either scrap its covenant or cancel the 29 provisions he said call for Israel's destruction.\nRubin indicated the administration would not press the point at the summit. He said the Palestinians had taken action on the charter and that any further changes should be taken up by Israel with the Palestinians.\nShoval said a redeployment of Israeli forces on the West Bank and specific security measures by the Palestinians are the \"two pillars\" of any accord.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO Photos from AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\n (1) An Israeli settler Wednesday glances at posters showing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.\n (2) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left) walks with Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan ibn Talal on Wednesday after they met in Amman, Jordan, as Netanyahu headed for the U.S.-hosted summit in Maryland.\n\nLoad-Date: October 15, 1998"
