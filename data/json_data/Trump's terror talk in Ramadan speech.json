    "full text": "WASHINGTON - President Trump used more than half of his statement marking the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan to discuss terrorism, a sharp break from past Presidents' practices and a continuation of his frequent inability to discuss the world's second-largest religion without mentioning terror attacks.\nAfter wishing \"all Muslims a joyful Ramadan,\" Trump quickly pivoted into a lecture on how good Muslims should reject terrorists.\n\"This year, the holiday begins as the world mourns the innocent victims of barbaric terrorist attacks in the United Kingdom and Egypt, acts of depravity that are directly contrary to the spirit of Ramadan. Such acts only steel our resolve to defeat the terrorists and their perverted ideology,\" he said. \"America will always stand with our partners against terrorism and the ideology that fuels it. During this month of Ramadan, let us be resolved to spare no measure so that we may ensure that future generations will be free of this scourge and able to worship and commune in peace.\"\nThat message follows a big speech in Saudi Arabia earlier this week in which Trump took his most inclusive tone yet on Islam. He said the fight against terror is \"not a battle between different faiths\" and dropped his often-used campaign rhetoric against \"radical Islamic terrorism.\"\nCandidate Trump caustically called for a ban on all Muslims entering the U.S., and repeatedly (and falsely) claimed American Muslims had cheered on 9/11.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nNLVL\n\nLoad-Date: May 27, 2017"
