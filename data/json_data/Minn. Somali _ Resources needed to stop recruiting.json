    "full text": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - A member of a Somali-American youth group in Minnesota says the federal government should provide resources and assist local groups in the \"uphill battle\" to prevent young people from being recruited into terrorist organizations like al-Shabab.\nMohamed Farah, president of Ka Joog, testified Thursday during a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing about the threat of al-Shabab, an al-Qaida-linked group based in Somalia that has claimed responsibility for the Sept. 21 mall attack in Kenya that killed at least 67 people.\n\"The number one issue of our community is the recruitment of our youth,\" Farah said, according to his prepared testimony. He said al-Shabab has \"targeted the disenfranchised, marginalized and socially estranged\" youth.\nSince 2007, at least 22 young men have left Minnesota to join al-Shabab, including two who left last summer. Ka Joog, which means \"stay away,\" is one group that has been working to provide positive alternatives for Somali youth through education, the arts and mentorship.\nFarah said the U.S. has spent billions of dollars fighting terrorism overseas, and some of that money should go toward supporting local efforts to deter youth from becoming radicalized.\n\nLoad-Date: October 7, 2013"
