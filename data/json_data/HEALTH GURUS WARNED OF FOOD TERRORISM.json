    "full text": "ATLANTA (AP) -- Hundreds of health officials descended on Atlanta this week for an annual conference on emerging infectious diseases and were warned that terrorists might try to spread deadly germs through the food supply.\nTerrorists could try to make the biological attack even more dangerous by taking down critical communications systems, according to experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\"The national system was overwhelmed\" by the anthrax scare last fall, said Dr. James Hughes, chief of infectious diseases at the Atlanta-based CDC. \"Clearly we learned that we were not adequately prepared. This was a small attack.\"\nAnthrax and smallpox\nThe conference agenda, usually filled with sessions on obscure diseases and small outbreaks, is dominated by information on anthrax and smallpox, among the most dangerous terrorist agents.\nThe anthrax-by-mail attacks killed five people last fall and sickened 13 others. The CDC said earlier this month that a Texas laboratory worker handling specimens became infected and is recovering.\nHughes said health experts must consider the possibility of genetically altered germs, the release of more than one agent at a time, or transmission through animals and the food supply.\nTo guard against deadlier attacks, the CDC is distributing $ 918 million to state and local health departments later this year and next year. The CDC is encouraging them to give priority to upgrading labs and training health workers on recognizing diseases like anthrax and smallpox.\n\nLoad-Date: March 26, 2002"
