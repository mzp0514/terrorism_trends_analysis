    "full text": "Survivors of the bombings in Oklahoma City and at the World Trade Center watched Wednesday as President Bill Clinton signed a bill that provides new tools and tougher penalties for the war against terrorism.\nAt a White House ceremony, Clinton told the bombing survivors and the families of victims of 11 other terrorist attacks: \"We renew our fight against those who seek to terrorize us, in your names.\nWe send a loud, clear message today all over the world, in your names: America will never surrender to terror.\"\nIn all, almost two dozen members of Congress joined the president, including Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., Clinton's near-certain rival in the November presidential election.\nMore than a year in the making, the bill expands the government's power to exclude suspected foreign terrorists from the United States. Authorities say it will require chemical markers in some explosive materials, making traces easier. It also imposes unprecedented curbs on federal appeals by death-row inmates.\nBut the bill was not as tough as Clinton wanted. Congress dropped provisions that would have made it easier to wiretap phones of suspected terrorists and would have enabled the armed forces to help in cases involving chemical and biological weapons.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO; Photo by AP - President Bill Clinton chats with (from left) Sen.
