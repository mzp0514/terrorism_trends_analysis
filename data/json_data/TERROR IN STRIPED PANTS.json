    "full text": "One reason it's hard to discourage government-sponsored international terrorism is that it's often hard to prove it is truly government-sponsored. There seems to be no such problem in West Berlin.\nAN-ATwo Iraqis, carrying both a bomb and Iraqi diplomatic passports, have been arrested. Why then does the West German Government, citing raisons d'etat, request that they merely be exiled, not prosecuted?\nThe Iraqis were posted at their nation's embassy in East Berlin.  They were arrested by West Berlin police after passing an explosive to a police informer. Their plot, police say, was to bomb a meeting of Kurdish students opposed to the Iraqi regime. West Berliners were of course outraged. A logical response from Bonn would have been to reinforce local legal action with in-ternational investigation and perhaps diplomatic sanctions. But Bonn did just the opposite.\nConceivably, Bonn's obscure ''foreign policy considerations'' are in fact compelling. Rumors hint that some prisoner exchange deal is cooking. Yet as West\nBerlin's Mayor Stobbe insists, ''We've got to be given some plausible grounds for the release of these men.'' The evidence grows that Iran, Libya, Iraq and other nations use assassination abroad as an instrument of domestic politics. If other countries respond with silence or polite diplomacy, government-sponsored terror can only flourish. Until some ''plausible grounds'' are in fact produced, West Germany's present conduct can only increase the danger of terrorism, in West Berlin and everywhere else."
