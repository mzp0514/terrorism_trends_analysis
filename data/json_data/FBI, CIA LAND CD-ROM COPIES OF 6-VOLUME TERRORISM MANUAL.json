(AP) U.S. intelligence agencies have obtained CD-ROM copies of a six-volume manual they believe is used by Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden to train recruits at his terrorism camps in Afghanistan.\nThe 1,000-page manual contains information on how to recruit followers, shoot weapons, carry out assassinations, assemble bombs and other terrorist operations similar to those that destroyed U.S. embassies in East Africa in 1998, USA Today reported in Monday's editions, citing unnamed U.S. intelligence officials.\nBin Laden, who is believed to be in Afghanistan, has been indicted in the United States in connection with the attacks in Kenya and Tanzania that killed more than 200 people.\nHe has denied involvement.\nThe CIA and FBI declined to comment on the manual, but other intelligence officials called it a \"gold mine\" of information they hope to use to help slow or disrupt terrorist operations.\nWhite House spokesman Joe Lockhart declined comment specifically about the manual, but said bin Laden's organization has become more sophisticated in its training techniques, \"which requires the kind of response that I think you've seen from this government over the past few years.\"\nThe manual, in CD-ROM form, recently was given to the CIA and the FBI by intelligence officials from Jordan, who seized it from one of 16 men arrested in Jordan.\n\nLoad-Date: September 20, 2000"
