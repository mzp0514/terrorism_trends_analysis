    "full text": "Antonio Cardinal Poma, a leader of the Roman Catholic Church in Italy during 10 years of social upheaval over abortion, divorce and left-wing terrorism, died of heart problems today. He was 75 years old.\nA native of Villanterio in the northern Italian province of Pavia, Cardinal Poma was ordained to the priesthood in 1933 and taught at a seminary. He later became rector of the seminary.\nHe was named Bishop of Mantua in 1954 and Archbishop of the staunchly left-wing city of Bologna in 1968. In April 1969 Pope Paul VI made him a Cardinal. Cardinal Poma became president of the Italian Episcopal Conference the same year, a post he held until 1979.\nHis leadership of the Italian church was marked by divisive struggles over divorce and abortion and political upheaval caused by Red Brigades terrorism.\nHe took a tough line with Italy's Communists and suggested that Catholics who ran on Communist tickets in June 1976 elections should be excommunicated. Cardinal Poma was able to obtain support for the idea from only 40 percent of Italian bishops, however, and it was effectively dropped.\nIn 1983 he resigned from running his archdiocese because of heart disease and was named archbishop emeritus.\nCardinal Poma's death leaves 151 members of the Sacred College of Cardinals, of whom 117 are under the age of 80 and have the right to take part in a conclave to elect a new Pope.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nphoto of Antonio Cardinal Poma (Camera Press)"
