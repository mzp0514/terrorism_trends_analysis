As such, there is a legitimate concern that it might be difficult to impanel impartial and indifferent jurors who can render a verdict based solely on the evidence presented in court.\"\nReporter Elaine Silvestrini can be reached at (813) 259-7837 or esilvestrini@tampatrib.com\nPhoto: Youssef Megahed\nHe sought to have his case severed from that of Ahmed Mohamed.\nCopyright Â© 2008, The Tampa Tribune and may not be republished without permission.
