    "full text": "NEW YORK -- Disappointed by a report on the economy and uneasy following warnings of more terror attacks, investors cashed in profits Monday and sent stocks sharply lower.\nStocks already were expected to retreat somewhat after last week's big rally, during which the tech sector had its biggest weekly percentage gain in 13 months.\nBut statements about terrorism by Vice President Dick Cheney and the FBI, as well as a disappointing Index of Leading Economic Indicators, prompted additional selling.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average closed down 123.58, or 1.2 percent at 10,229.50, according to preliminary calculations. But the Dow hung onto much of its advance from last week when it climbed 413.16, or 4.2 percent.\nThe broader market also pulled back. The Nasdaq composite index fell 39.80, or 2.3 percent, to 1,701.59, having on Friday claimed a five-session winning streak, its first since early October. The Nasdaq ended the week up 140.54, or 8.8 percent. It was the Nasdaq's biggest weekly percentage gain since the week that ended April 20, 2001 when it rose 10.3 percent.\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 14.71, or 1.3 percent, to 1,091.88, after rising 51.60, or 4.9 percent, last week.\nThe selling was intensified by fears of more terror attacks and economic news.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers more than 9 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was light.\nThe Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller company stocks, fell 5.77, or 1.1 percent, to 503.17.\n\nLoad-Date: May 21, 2002"
