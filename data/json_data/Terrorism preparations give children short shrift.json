An official report will be completed by next week, he says, and will be sent to state and federal emergency planners and medical associations.\nAmong the recommendations:\n * Child-size doses of nerve gas antidote should be obtained. Ambulances in most major cities carry penlike injectors containing atropine and pralidoxine, developed by the military, that can be easily jabbed into a victim's thigh after exposure to nerve gas. The experts urge approval of pediatric-dosed injectors, which have long been available in Israel, Markenson says. Meanwhile, the adult injectors can be used for children as young as 3 if needed, and for those under 3, the recommendation is to draw a smaller dose from the injector.\n * Communities should plan ways to assure that all children exposed to radioactive material are given potassium iodide within two hours to prevent thyroid cancer.\n * Mental health services for children will be needed. Families need help coping with this \"very uncomfortable time in our lives,\" says pediatrician Irwin Redlener, president of the Children's Health Fund, which organized the conference.\n\nLoad-Date: February 19, 2003"
