    "full text": "A possible terrorist attack and the arrests of about a dozen people, some with possible links to fugitive Saudi businessman Osama bin Laden, prompted a State Department warning to Americans abroad, senior U.S. officials said yesterday.\nThe arrests, made in a Middle Eastern country, were related to information that one or more terrorist attacks were planned to coincide with 2000 celebrations, the officials said.\nTargets for the attacks were not clear, but they appeared likely to involve Americans overseas, the officials said.\nOne official said the episode was \"one of the factors that went into the State Department decision to issue the warning over the weekend.\" The allegations \"are serious and credible,\" the official said.\nThe State Department on Saturday warned Americans living or traveling abroad to take extra precautions between now and the first week in January. It cited \"credible information\" that terrorists were planning attacks \"specifically targeting American citizens.\" It suggested that likely targets were locations where there would be large gatherings and celebrations.\nOne official said that the arrests were \"a local operation\" and that the U.S. government did not participate. The country where the arrests took place was not identified.\n\"Associates of bin Laden appear to be involved,\" the official said.\nBin Laden has been indicted by a New York grand jury in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 220 people.\n\nLoad-Date: October 22, 2002"
