    "full text": "WASHINGTON -- Presidential advisers huddle with Hollywood executives. Cabinet members and generals meet with Muslim media. White House aides in London and Pakistan \"war rooms\" arrange pro-American publicity.\nThe United States is cranking up efforts to build and retain foreign support for the war against terrorism.\n\"Consider the alternative, which is silence, or letting other people speak for us, so I think we have no choice,\" said Charlotte Beers, undersecretary of state for public diplomacy, on Friday.\nFearing a waning of overseas support as U.S. bombs drop over Afghanistan, the Bush administration is working closely with advertising agencies and local experts to find more ways to disseminate its message against terrorists.\nIt recently put together an information war room, similar to the ones used to plot strategy for political campaigns. Diplomats, communications experts and White House aides were dispatched to Pakistan and London with orders to bolster the U.S. image.\nThe State Department has been trying to counter Arab resentment toward America, primarily because of its support for Israel. Secretary of State Colin Powell and other top officials grant daily interviews to print, television and radio outlets based in Lebanon, Egypt, Pakistan, United Arab Emirates and other Arab nations.\n\"I'm very concerned that we get our information out in full context,\" Beers said. \"We know that in many of the countries where our messages are sent, that often they're distorted, they're one-dimensional or they're simply not heard.\"\n\nLoad-Date: November 11, 2001"
