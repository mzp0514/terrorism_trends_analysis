    "full text": "As a candidate and as president, Barack Obama has said the U.S. government didn't commit enough troops to Afghanistan, which he called the epicenter in the war against al-Qaeda.\nWar effort\n\"The Afghan government needs to do more. But we have to understand that the situation is precarious and urgent here in Afghanistan.  I think one of the biggest mistakes we've made strategically after 9/11 was to fail to finish the job here, focus our attention here. We got distracted by Iraq.\"\nJuly 2008\n\"While we've achieved hard-earned milestones in Iraq, the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated. After escaping across the border into Pakistan in 2001 and 2002, al-Qaeda's leadership established a safe haven there. Although a legitimate government was elected by the Afghan people, it's been hampered by corruption, the drug trade, an underdeveloped economy, and insufficient security forces.\"\nDecember 2009\n\"This is the beginning - but not the end - of our effort to wind down this war. We will have to do the hard work of keeping the gains that we have made, while we draw down our forces and transition responsibility for security to the Afghan government. And next May, in Chicago, we will host a summit with our NATO allies and partners to shape the next phase of this transition.\"\nJune 2011\nAnti-terrorism fight\n\"I believe this has to be our central focus, the central front, on  our battle against terrorism.\"\nJuly 2008\n\"I make this decision because I am convinced that our security is at stake in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This is the epicenter of violent extremism practiced by al-Qaeda. It is from here that we were attacked on 9/11, and it is from here that new attacks are being plotted as I speak. This is no idle danger; no hypothetical threat.\"\nDecember 2009\n\"Al-Qaeda is under more pressure than at any time since 9/11. Together with the Pakistanis, we have taken out more than half of al-Qaeda's leadership. And thanks to our intelligence professionals and Special Forces, we killed Osama bin Laden, the only leader that al-Qaeda had ever known.\"\nJune 2011\nTroop levels\n\"For at least a year now, I have called for two additional brigades, perhaps three. I think it's very important that we unify command more effectively to coordinate our military activities. But military alone is not going to be enough.\"\nJuly 2008\n\"I have determined that it is in our vital national interest to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan. After 18 months, our troops will begin to come home.\"\nDecember 2009\n\"Starting next month, we will be able to remove 10,000 of our troops from Afghanistan by the end of this year, and we will bring home a total of 33,000 troops by next summer, fully recovering the surge I announced at West Point.\"\nJune 2011\nSources: CBS News, the White House \n\nLoad-Date: June 23, 2011"
