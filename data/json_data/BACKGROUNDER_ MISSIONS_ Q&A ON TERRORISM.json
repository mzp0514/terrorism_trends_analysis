I haven't seen anything about this for a year or so. --- Joyce Meadows, Douglasville A:The most recent report by the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, dated Aug. 30, says it \"still has not been able to carry out the mission in Iraq entrusted to it by the Security Council to address unresolved disarmament issues . . . in the course of carrying out a reinforced system of ongoing monitoring and verification.\"\nIt adds that Iraq's position, expressed to the U.N. secretary-general, is that it has fulfilled the United Nations' requirements \"and that there is no ground for inspection.\"\nAJC\nIn the absence of on-site inspection, the commission is trying to increase the use of other sources of information, such as overhead imagery.\nThe Security Council imposed sanctions on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions cannot be lifted until U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Iraq's nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs have been dismantled, along with its long-range missile program.\nBut inspectors with the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, left Iraq in December 1998 ahead of U.S. and British missile strikes launched to punish the country for not cooperating with inspectors. Since then, the Iraqi government has barred U.N. inspectors from returning, demanding instead that sanctions be lifted immediately.\nUnpublished U.N. weapons inspection reports, meanwhile, indicate that Iraq evaded U.N. sanctions in the 1990s by importing military equipment to build missiles and nuclear weapons from companies in Eastern Europe and Russia.\nThe reports were disclosed by Gary Milhollin, director of the Washington-based Project on Nuclear Arms Control, a nonprofit watchdog group, and researcher Kelly Motz in the July-August Commentary magazine. --- Contributing: Sharon Gaus\nDo you have a question about the news?
