State Department officials are not considering removing Cuba, which has been under a U.S. economic embargo since 1962, from the list.\n\"The report makes it clear that the State Department doesn't really believe that Cuba is a state sponsor of terrorism,\" said Geoff Thale, program director at the Washington Office on Latin America, a liberal advocacy group. \"Cuba is clearly on the terrorist list for political reasons.\"\nCuba still shelters about two dozen members of the Basque Fatherland and Liberty, one of the terrorist groups on the list, according to the report. But Havana has reduced its support for the group and no longer provides its members with travel documents, the report says.\nCuba also has provided haven for members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known by its Spanish initials FARC . But last November, Cuba began hosting peace talks between the Colombian government and the rebels.\nWashington faulted Cuba in the past for doing too little to prevent money laundering and international terrorist financing. But last year Cuba joined the Financial Action Task Force of South America, an intergovernmental group that seeks to enforce U.S.-supported standards on such illicit activities.\nCuba's shift reflects changes in the country's leadership and a preoccupation with internal economic problems, analysts say.\nThe report said there was a sharp increase in Iran's sponsorship of terrorism around the world, including attacks or attempted attacks in India, Thailand, Georgia and Kenya.\nThe State Department added three terrorist groups to the list: Jemmah Anshorut Tauhid, of Indonesia; the Abdallah Azzam Brigades, of Lebanon and the Arabian Peninsula; and the Haqqani Network, of Afghanistan and Pakistan. It removed one group from the list, the Mujahedeen Khalq, or MEK, an Iranian opposition group based primarily in Iraq.\n\nLoad-Date: May 31, 2013"
