A week earlier, a jetliner bound for\nParis explodes, killing all 230 on board.\nTwo acts of violence. Perhaps two acts of terrorism.\nIn their wake, a growing paranoia. What is that bag? Who left\nthat there? Where are you going? Can I see your I.D.?\nAll in one weekend: A \"suspicious\" bag left outside Birmingham's\nLegion Field is removed by bomb technicians and investigated;\nit contains soft drinks.\nA phone call and \"suspicious\" bag force police to evacuate 1,000\npeople from Union Station in Washington, D.C.; no bomb is found.\nBomb-sniffing dogs are brought in after a backpack is left near\na fence outside the White House; it's a tourist's harmless belongings.\nA telephoned bomb threat halts ferry service for several hours\nbetween Mukilteo and the Whidbey Island town of Clinton in Washington\nstate, prompting the evacuation of two buildings.\nAt Minneapolis-St Paul International Airport, unattended bags\nhave police \"running\" to check out each one, says Sgt. Steve\nAlfveby.\nIn this over-anxious, over-wrought, over-cautious July, fears\nof terrorism both real and imagined have raised the image of an\nopen society slipping toward a bunker mentality. Search all luggage\non international flights. Install million-dollar bomb-detection\ndevices at airports nationwide.\nSearch. Pat down. Question. Are we seeing the fortressing of America?\nWill we see more?\n\"You don't know who the bad guys are. You don't know who to look\nout for,\" says Dan Seiler, 34, of Burlington, N.C., while visiting\nNew York City.\nFear of violent crime -- and now terrorism -- is creating \"a\nneo-medieval society,\" reminiscent of the era when towns were\nwalled and buildings constructed with an eye toward defense, says\nBrian Jenkins, senior director of Kroll Associates, a New York\ninternational security firm.\nHeightened security\nPut a gate around your community. Install a high-tech security\nsystem for your house. Put a video camera in the nursery to watch\nthe nanny.\n\"In those days it was castles and moats,\" Jenkins says. \"Today\nit's Kevlar (used in bulletproof vests), electronic access control\nsystems, closed-circuit TV and concrete (posts) surrounding federal\nbuildings. It's 20th-century technology, but the concepts are\nmedieval.\"\nAcross the nation, public gathering spots -- from football fields\nto airports -- have heightened security.\n-- In Massachusetts, authorities reassessed the safety of sports\narenas and stadiums. Don Lowery, a spokesman for the New England\nPatriots, said the organization has been increasing security since\nFoxboro Stadium hosted the World Cup soccer matches in 1994.\n-- At the Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, the mayor\nclosed access to the concourse to those without tickets.\n-- In New York, Mayor Rudy Giuliani added extra police to large\nevents such as the Colombian Independence Festival held Sunday\nat Flushing Meadow Park in Queens. About 250,000 attended, and\nno problems were reported.\n\"There is nothing for people to be afraid of,\" Giuliani says.\nYet even as people seem to boast that \"You can't change my behavior,\"\nthey are feeling vulnerable.\nThe Olympic bombing and the TWA explosions were a \"double whammy,\"\nsays S. George Reed, 58, of Orange, N.J. \"It puts us on guard,\"\nsays Reed, sitting with wife Carolyn at a restaurant next to Lincoln\nCenter in New York. \"At least we're aware we're as vulnerable\nas anyone else.\"\nIt's a feeling of being \"held hostage,\" says Henry Snyder, whose\nbrother, Steve, was the pilot on Flight 800.\n\"I just hate to feel held hostage by this terrorist,\" says the\ntruck driver from Churchville, N.Y. \"Gosh, if it means not flying\nsomeplace because you've got fear of being brought out of the\nair by some stupid nut, then they've won.\"\nDarla Worden of Reno, Calif., finds it hard to believe that all\nthis is happening in the USA. \"We're here, but there's a part\nof us that's looking at people's bags and wondering,\" says Worden,\nvisiting Universal Studios in Hollywood with her family.\n\"You can't be daunted by one wanton, decadent, wild act of terrorism,\"\nsays Ivelaw Griffith, a political science professor visiting Miami\nfor the city's 100th birthday celebration. \"Life has got to go\non as normally as possible.\"\nInternational terrorism expert Mike Ackerman sees such reactions\nby the public not as bravado or complacency but simply as appropriate\nresponses to a murderous crime \"that only has worldwide significance\nbecause it happened to a crowd during the Olympics.\"\nActs of violence, whether politically motivated violence or not,\ncan raise the collective fear in a society way beyond the threat,\nexperts say.\nBut more can be done to ease the threat, says Brian Levin, co-author\nof The Limits of Dissent, a book about militias.\n\"In a democratic society with open access, you can't guard against\nevery sick person,\" he says.\nBut at the least we should expect more video monitoring of public\nplaces, Levin says.\nSome have called for limits on sales of poisonous chemicals, or\na number-marking system for items that can be used to make bombs.\nUsing pellets in gunpowder to leave traces is being discussed.\nThat way, a bomb's maker could be found.\nCrisis prevention\n\"What we have to do as a society is to try and make hurdles as\nhigh as possible to deter the marginal terrorist,\" Levin says.\n\"But not make it so high as to limit civil liberties and joys\nof living in a peaceful society.\"\nBecause of a rising threat of violence and terrorism, Marriott\nHotels is importing its crisis management program from Europe\nto the USA. The company is hosting both the International Olympic\nCommittee in Atlanta and will host the Republican National Committee\nin San Diego next month.\nMarriott will be training staffers to deal with terrorism, hostage\nsituations and the care of people in crisis, such as families\nof plane crash victims.\n\"We have to ask ourselves: How much is the American public willing\nto be inconvenienced (by anti-terrorism measures)?\" says Marriott's\nsecurity chief, Chad Callaghan. \"What's the right balance between\nsecurity and convenience?\"\nAlready, Americans spend about $ 65 billion on private security.\nThere are 1.6 million people employed as private security guards.\nIn four years, that will be 2 million people and $ 100 billion,\nJenkins says.\nAckerman, head of the Miami-based Ackerman Group, says there's\nno reason to put bomb-scanners at mall doorways, frisk visitors\nto Old Faithful or otherwise step up security at popular tourist\nspots.\n\"I don't think we're anywhere near close to that need for concern.\nIn places like Israel, if you see an unaccompanied knapsack, you\nare trained to think of it as a bomb.\" But \"a lost knapsack\nin Disney World is a lost knapsack.\"\nContributing: Cathy Grossman, Gale Holland, Maria Puente, Deborah\nSharp, Christine Sparta and Jeannie Williams\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO, b/w, Michael Probst, AP; PHOTO, b/w, Porter Binks, USA TODAY; PHOTO, b/w, Johanna Vossler, USA TODAY; Games' busiest day: Huge crowds, including more than 80,000 people at Olympic Stadium, above, appeared undeterred by tougher security screening and fears of terrorism.
