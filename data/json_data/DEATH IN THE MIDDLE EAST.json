    "full text": "The Lod Airport massacre, the slaying of Israeli athletes in Munich, the murder of school children at Maalot, the commandeering of a bus in the Israeli Negev and wounding and killing its passengers, the Jerusalem bus bomb - these are only some of the countless acts of barbarism that the Palestine Liberation Organization and its many factions have committed against Israeli.  The last one is particularly etched in my mind as I held one of two sisters seriously wounded in the blast only moments before she died.\nShe was 11 years old. She and her 13-year-old sister, who also died of her injuries, were riding the bus home from school. How does the editorial page deal with these atrocities committed by the PLO? The Jan. 24 editorial ignores these; instead it has the nerve to suggest that the Israeli government, by attempting to suppress acts of violent protest, ''will erode its people's valid moral claim to a homeland in the Middle East.'' It suggested that Israel must negotiate with the PLO, ostensibly because the PLO has renounced terrorism. First, if any group has lost its moral claim to a homeland, it is the PLO, which for decades has embraced terrorism. Second, I suggest that the Post-Dispatch not fall victim to the public relations bonanza that Yasser Arafat has orchestrated for the benefit of the Western press but do some investigative reporting, initially by monitoring Arabic language broadcasts from the PLO to those living on the West Bank and in Gaza. You will find that violence, terrorism and the goal of destroying Israel are still an integral part of the PLO's rhetoric.  Carey Fredman University City\n\nLoad-Date: October 23, 1993"
