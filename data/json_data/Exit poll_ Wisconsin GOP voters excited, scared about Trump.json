Bernie Sanders but view Hillary Clinton as the better candidate to beat Trump.\nOther exit poll highlights:\nGOP: MIXED FEELINGS\nAbout a quarter of Wisconsin GOP primary voters said they're excited about Trump, while less than 15 percent said that of either Ohio Gov. John Kasich or Texas' Sen. Ted Cruz, exit polls show.\nAt the same time, nearly 4 in 10 said they're scared about what Trump would do as president, while only about 1 in 10 said that about either Cruz or Kasich.\nDEMOCRATS: OPTIMISTIC\nAt least 7 in 10 Democratic primary voters in Wisconsin said they were excited or optimistic about what either candidate would do in office, but they were more likely to be excited about Sanders. About a third said they were excited about what he would do, while about half as many said that about Clinton.\nECONOMIC WORRIES\nBoth Republican and Democratic voters in Wisconsin said the economy was weighing heavily on their minds. Three quarters of Democratic voters said they were worried about the direction of the U.S. economy. Republicans who came out to vote were even more troubled by the direction of the economy.\nTERRORISM\nWhile 3 in 10 voters in the Republican primary said terrorism was the most important issue, only about 10 percent of voters in the Democratic primary selected terrorism. However, 70 percent of Democrats were very or somewhat worried about the prospect of a major attack. (Republicans were not asked that question.)\n\nGraphic\n\n \n Abi Nesbitt, a UW-Eau Claire freshman from Mosinee, Wis., votes in her first primary election at UW-Eau Claire's Davies Center on Tuesday morning, April 5, 2016.
