    "full text": "Regarding \"Israeli Offensive Kills 20 In Camp\" (Nation/World, May 19):\nNever in my entire life have I been more ashamed to be American. \nAfter reading the news of the bloodshed in the occupied territory of Gaza, I was disgusted. We are fighting a war against terrorism, yet we are the main sponsors of terrorism? Twenty Palestinians were killed in these operations, including a 13-year-old boy and his 16-year-old sister, who were outside hanging the laundry. They were both shot once in the head, an indication that they were shot by a sniper, not hit randomly.\nIn addition to the killing, the Israelis are demolishing houses at an astounding rate — 100 houses in just a week, leaving more than 1,100 people homeless. The entire world has condemned these horrible war crimes and atrocities except for our country. We seem so eager to stop terrorism everywhere in the world, yet we spend billions of dollars a year to support terrorism. As patriotic Americans, we really need to step back and re-evaluate our commitment to Israel, but that would be only if we were really serious about fighting terrorism.\nOMAR MUBARAK\nTampa\nCopyright © 2004, The Tampa Tribune and may not be republished without permission.
