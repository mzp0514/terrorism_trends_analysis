    "full text": "FLINT, MICH. - A Canadian man shouted in Arabic before stabbing a police officer in the neck at the Flint airport on Wednesday, and he referred to people being killed overseas during the attack that's now being investigated as an act of terrorism, federal officials said.\nAmor Ftouhi, 49, of Montreal, was immediately taken into custody. A criminal complaint charging him with committing violence at an airport says Ftouhi asked an officer who subdued him why the officer didn't kill him.\nAlthough the attack is being investigated as terrorism, authorities have no indication at this time that he was involved in a \"wider plot,\" said FBI Special Agent in Charge David Gelios. \"At this time we view him as a lone-wolf attacker,\" he said.\nThe criminal complaint says Ftouhi stabbed Lt. Jeff Neville with a large knife after yelling \"Allahu akbar,\" the Arabic phrase for \"God is great.\" According to the FBI, Ftouhi said something similar to \"you have killed people in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, and we are all going to die.\"\nNeville was in satisfactory condition, airport police Chief Chris Miller said at a late-afternoon news conference where the charges were announced.\nFtouhi appeared in federal court in Flint to hear the charge and will get a court-appointed attorney. A court spokesman said Ftouhi will remain in custody until a bond hearing next Wednesday.\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer said President Donald Trump was briefed on the stabbing.\n\nLoad-Date: June 22, 2017"
