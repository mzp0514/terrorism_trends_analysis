Security has slowly improved under the proxy force, which is led by the African Union but bankrolled and trained by the United States, European Union and United Nations. \nCarson said the internationally backed plan for Somalia's political reconstruction was working because the country's neighbors, the United States, E.U. and United Nations had subscribed to a common set of goals. \nHe cautioned that a regional and international consensus would be required.. \n\nLoad-Date: October 29, 2012"
