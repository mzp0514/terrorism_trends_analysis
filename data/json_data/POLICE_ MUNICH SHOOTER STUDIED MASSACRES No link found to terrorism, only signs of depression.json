The gunman died of a self-inflicted gunshot.\nDe Maiziere said David researched a 2009 school shooting in Germany, as well as the attack by anti-immigrant agitator Anders Behring Breivik, who killed 77 people in Norway in July 2011.\nInitial investigations suggested that the shooter, the son of two asylum seekers from Iran who came to Germany in the late 1990s, had been treated for psychological problems. Police Chief Hubertus Andrae said Saturday there were signs the gunman suffered from depression.\nThe dead included three \"youngsters,\" police said. Three people among 27 injured remained in critical condition. The shooting began outside a McDonald's and later erupted at the Olympia shopping mall. Munich police said the gunman apparently hacked a Facebook account and sent a message urging people to come to the mall for a giveaway.\nStanglin reported from McLean, Va.\n\nLoad-Date: July 24, 2016"
