    "full text": "Re: \"5 years later, more needs to be done,\" Sept. 7:\nContrary to Claudia Rosett's assertion, Americans are not weary of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. We are weary of the war in Iraq. We feel that the Iraq war was at best a mistake or at worst a con job on the American people.\nWe are not relaxed into a false confidence. Rather we have no confidence in how the struggle against terrorism, a struggle we support, is being prosecuted.\nWe have not forgotten how powerful America is. Rather, we question whether our leaders' overreliance on brute force is misplaced, misused and ineffective. We sense that the struggle against terrorism is only partially a military struggle and overwhelmingly a struggle for hearts and minds. It is not that we are reticent to use military might. Given its terrible destructive power, we are reticent to use it unwisely.\nAlthough we were thoroughly humiliated in the Vietnam War, we won the larger war, the Cold War. We will win the struggle against international terrorism, and we will win it sooner and with less cost once we begin to wean ourselves from our overreliance on military power.\nTo admit failure in Iraq will not, shocking as it may seem, jeopardize our struggle against international terrorism, except perhaps in the very short term. Perhaps if we adopt the less arrogant and more measured policy of containment rather than outright victory, we will once again triumph based on our inner strength rather than outward show of military force.\nRabbi Avi WinokurPhiladelphiarebwinokur@societyhillsynagogue.org\n\nLoad-Date: September 13, 2006"
