    "full text": "To the Editor:\n One must admire Paul Flacks's acuity in extracting ''nuances'' and ''faint suggestions'' from my March 29 letter ('' 'New' Palestinians Needed to Make Peace in the Middle East,'' letter April 12). So as not to place further strain on his intuitive faculties, let me state plainly that I do indeed regret that there emerged a P.L.O., whose brutality cost the lives of hundreds and thousands of innocent Jewish and non- Jewish lives.\nUnlike Mr. Flacks, I derive no compensating joy or satisfaction from the fact that Yasir Arafat's terrorism succeeded in preventing negotiations that might have led to territorial compromise on the West Bank and to a peaceful resolution of the Palestinian problem.  That Israel succeeded, as a consequence of the bankruptcy of Palestinian leadership and of P.L.O. terrorism, in establishing settlements in ''historic Israel'' is for many Israelis and American Jews no cause for celebration. Unlike Mr. Flacks, they would have preferred compromise and peace to ''historic Israel'' and the prospect of endless conflict. That Arafat's bloody terrorism precluded that option is for them a cause of regret, not satisfaction.  Those, like Mr. Flacks, who feel otherwise should not be surprised if his invitation to ''new Palestinians'' to come to the negotiating table sounds - to put it mildly - less than convincing.\n \nHENRY SIEGMAN Executive Director American Jewish Congress New York, April 12, 1984"
