    "full text": "To the Editor:\nIn your Sept. 9 news story ''A Mainstay of Terrorism,'' Dr. Carlton E. Turner, director of the White House Drug Abuse Policy Office, is quoted as saying that the P.L.O. funds its activities ''with drugs.''\nThis accusation is erroneous and ill-founded.\nLetter by Palestine National Fund head H Nasir rejects Dr Carlton E Turner's comment, in Sept 9 article, that PLO finances activities through drug traffickingThe P.L.O. receives financial support from various Arab countries as well as from taxes levied on Palestinians. These funds are used to support Palestinians and their institutions, and that includes medical, health, educational and social services as well as the P.L.O.'s armed forces. In other words, the P.L.O. acts as a full-fledged government for the Palestinians as far as the collection and disbursement of funds is concerned.\nThe financial affairs of the P.L.O. are controlled by a board which is directly responsible to the Palestinian parliament (the Palestine National Council). The board is composed of Palestinians who enjoy high credibility, nationally and internationally. Under no circumstances have funds come from illegal operations, and the Palestine National Fund is proud that since its establishment it has gained the respect of the Palestinians.\nIt is surprising that a man in the position of Dr. Carlton would not check his facts before making his malicious accusations.\n \nH. NASIR\nHead, Palestine National Fund\nAmman, Jordan, Sept. 27, 1984"
