    "full text": "This time the Empire struck first.\nThe Empire State Building's managers recently sought stricter parking rules, voicing concerns about the risk of a terrorist truck bombing that were prompted by the attack on the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. This month -- to the surprise and chagrin of neighboring merchants -- the city responded by lining 33d Street between Broadway and Fifth Avenue with the requested \"No Standing\" signs.\nDelivery vans were immediately hit with $55 fines. Shop owners complained they had no legal way to get supplies. John Xidias, manager of the Skyscraper restaurant said when he begged one driver to deliver, \"he said only if you pay the tickets.\" Also affected were residents of the McAlpin House and major stores on 34th Street with delivery entrances on 33d, like the Gap and Sam Goody. Especially hard hit was the U2 restaurant at 28 West 33d, whose dinner trade depended on parking that had been legal at night. \"Now people drive up, see the sign and just take off,\" said David Kim, the owner.\nThe local City Councilman, Thomas Duane, said his office has been deluged with complaints. \"The administration imposed a decision without conferring with the impacted parties,\" said his aide, Chris, Quinn. \"It's a big mess.\"\nCommunity Board 5 \"probably could have suggested something that would have worked,\" said Joe Clift, a co-chairman of its transportation panel. But, contrary to procedure, the board was not notified.\nSome merchants complained that the 34th Street Business Improvement District, which represents them, did not consult before lobbying for the parking ban. They suggested that the district ignored their interests while promoting those of its chairman, Peter Malkin, an owner of the Empire State Building. But Daniel Pisark, the district's retail director, denied any favoritism. \"The point was to protect this landmark building,\" he said, \"as well as its neighbors, the people who work there and more than 2 million visitors a year.\"\nA spokeswoman for Empire State Partners, which owns the 102-story tower, said: \"The Empire State Building never planned on anybody's business being harmed. They just wanted to prevent a possible catastrophe.\" The spokeswoman, Jeanne Gargano, said the company now wants delivery privileges restored. The Empire State Building's deliveries are through a drive-in entrance.\nMerchants dispute the need for no-standing rules on 33d Street's south side and along the block's western half. They said it is far enough from the Empire State Building to be an unlikely target.\nA city transportation department spokesman, Oscar Serra, held out some hope for relief. \"We are looking at alternatives which are amicable and business-friendly,\" he said. \"We hope to resolve the complaints very shortly.\"   BRUCE LAMBERT\n\nLoad-Date: August 14, 1995"
