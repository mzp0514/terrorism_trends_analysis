In recent months, the county emergency-management office has sponsored several hazardous-materials and decontamination courses for fire departments throughout the county. Using state training funds, a number of additional hazardous-materials and domestic-preparedness classes are scheduled for firefighters, police and emergency medical responders beginning in March.\nAccording to Braun, efforts are also under way to improve decontamination capabilities in Boscobel and Platteville. Last year Grant Regional Health Center in Lancaster installed a new decontamination facility to handle patients who are contaminated with dangerous substances.\n\nLoad-Date: February 11, 2002"
