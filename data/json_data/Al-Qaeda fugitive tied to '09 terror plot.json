    "full text": "WASHINGTON -- A high-ranking al-Qaeda operative helped organize the foiled 2009 terrorist plot against New York City's subway, and his associates planned to attack the United Kingdom, federal prosecutors said Wednesday.\nAdnan El Shukrijumah, the subject of a seven-year worldwide manhunt, was charged with helping recruit Colorado resident Najibullah Zazi, whose attempt to detonate explosives was derailed by federal investigators on the eve of the eighth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.\nEl Shukrijumah's associates were also communicating with a British man, Abid Naseer, about a 2009 plot foiled in Manchester, England. Naseer was arrested Wednesday by British authorities, prosecutors said.\nThe government's disclosure adds a larger dimension to the subway plot, described by Attorney General Eric Holder as one of the most serious terrorism attempts on U.S. soil since the Sept. 1, 2001, attacks.\nProsecutors allege that El Shukrijumah and plotters Saleh al-Somali and Rashid Rauf helped recruit Zazi, a former Denver airport shuttle driver. They also recruited two co-conspirators to conduct suicide bombings in New York using devices made from ordinary household supplies, including hydrogen peroxide, acetone, flour and oil, prosecutors said.\nZazi and Zarein Ahmedzay have pleaded guilty to their roles in the plot. They are awaiting sentencing. A third suspect, Adis Medunjanin, is in custody awaiting trial.\nEl Shukrijumah, a 34-year-old native of Saudi Arabia who once lived in South Florida, is charged with directing Zazi and others to carry out attacks in the United States.\nIdentified by federal authorities as \"Ja'far the Pilot\" because of his aviation skills, El Shukrijumah was first outlined to federal investigators by al-Qaeda operations chief Khalid Sheikh Mohammed after his capture in 2003. Mohammed is awaiting trial as the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks.\nEl Shukrijumah faces numerous charges, including conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction and attempting to commit an act of terrorism. His whereabouts are unknown, and a $5 million reward is offered for information leading to his capture.\nTom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director, said the alleged links to Shukrijumah are \"pretty significant.\" He said it was unclear whether Zazi was offering up the al-Qaeda operative's name to win a lighter sentence.\n\"You really don't know if Zazi is just name-dropping,\" Fuentes said. \n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO, B/W, FBI via AP\n\nLoad-Date: July 8, 2010"
