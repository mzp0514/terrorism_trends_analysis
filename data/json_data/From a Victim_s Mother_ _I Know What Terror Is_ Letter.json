    "full text": "To the Editor:\nWhat is terrorism? As the country debates what acts of violence constitute terrorism, those of us directly affected by these acts know.\nMy son certainly does. His leg was amputated on July 3, 2016, after he stepped on a bomb placed in Central Park, in a highly trafficked area near the zoo. A small child was playing nearby at the time of the explosion.\nThe explosive material was TATP, a highly volatile substance used by terrorists in the Brussels, Paris and Manchester bombings. Despite these hallmarks of terrorism, New York City officials led the public to believe that the incident was either a fireworks mishap or a hobbyist’s experiment.\nWhat hobbyist risks life and limb transporting a volatile substance like this into the park?\nThe terrorist is still at large. Police officials and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms are now offering an award of up to $40,000 for leads. Photos or videos in or around the park in the days leading up to July 3, 2016, could provide clues. Anonymously call N.Y.P.D. Crime Stoppers with info at 1-800-577-8477.\nThe world we live in has changed. As one of the supporters commented on the GoFundMe site established for my son after the explosion: “In 1953, I lived in New York and I walked through Central Park daily. There were no bombs then.”\nCAROL GOLDEN, FAIRFAX, VA.\n\nLoad-Date: November 18, 2017"
