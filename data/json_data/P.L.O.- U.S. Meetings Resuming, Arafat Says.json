    "full text": "Talks between the United States and the Palestine Liberation Organization will resume Wednesday in Tunis after a three-month break, Yasir Arafat, chairman of the P.L.O., said today.\nMr. Arafat was speaking to reporters after meeting the Tunisian President, Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, in Carthage.\nThe first round of United States-P.L.O. talks took place in Carthage, a Tunis suburb, on Dec. 16, two days after Mr. Arafat met United States conditions for discussions, including renunciation of terrorism and recognition of Israel's right to exist.\nThe P.L.O. had hoped the talks would move ahead fast but became disillusioned when Washington appeared to be using the discussions to pass on Israeli complaints against alleged acts of terrorism. The only contacts since December have been informal meetings between the American Ambassador to Tunisia, Robert Pelletreau, and the P.L.O. representative, Hakam Balawi.\nEarlier in the day, Mr. Arafat's deputy, Salah Khalaf, said the P.L.O. would ask the United States to define terrorism and spell out its position on Palestinian self-determination and an international peace conference. ''We must define terrorism, so we no longer disagree on this,'' he said, ''since we consider that the intifada and the armed struggle against the occupation are not terrorism.'' Intifada is the name in Arabic for the uprising."
