There were no passengers aboard.\nEd Troyer, a spokesman for the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department, said on Twitter that the man was suicidal and there was no connection to terrorism.\nThe sheriff’s department said they were working to conduct a background investigation on the man, whose name was not immediately released.\nThe man could be heard on audio recordings telling air traffic controllers that he is “just a broken guy.”\nThe U.S. Coast Guard was sending a 45-foot (14-meter) vessel to the crash scene after witnesses reported seeing a large plume of smoke in the air, Petty Officer Ali Flockerzi said.\nHorizon Air is part of Alaska Air Group and flies shorter routes throughout the U.S. West. The Q400 ix a turboprop aircraft with 76 seats.\nSpokesmen for the Transportation Security Administration, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Aviation Administration directed inquiries to local authorities.\n\nLoad-Date: August 13, 2018"
