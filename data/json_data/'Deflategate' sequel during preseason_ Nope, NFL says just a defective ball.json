    "full text": "Eskin reported a Pittsburgh football looked \"very deflated\" and was \"like a marshmallow\".\nI, for one, am curious to see what the punishment for tossing a deflated ball in inarguably the least important game of the year is.\nThree years ago, the NFL launched an investigation and concluded that the Patriots used a deflated football during their blowout victory over the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Championship game.\nEskin joined the 94WIP Morning Show on Friday.\nWhile Eskin's certainly a loud buffoon, he purports that the NFL is now handling and investigating the football. \"So the ballboy comes over, picks up the football, and he squeezes\". It was so deflated.\nTrump doubles tariffs on Turkey, stoking jitters\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye . The NATO allies are at odds over the detention in Turkey of USA evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson on terrorism charges.\nLess than 12 hours later, the NFL sent a memo to reporters at the league owned network that basically said, \"nothing to see here\". The ball was found during the third quarter when Steelers third-round rookie quarterback Mason Rudolph at the helm.\n\"All footballs were in compliance with NFL rules following the pregame inspection process & all proper procedures were followed\", the statement read, as tweeted by NFL Media's Ian Rapoport.\nThis isn't the first time the Steelers have had the pressure of their footballs questioned.\nUnlike with the Patriots, the National Football League is ready to move on from this quickly.\n\nLoad-Date: August 11, 2018"
