Arms Inspector of Iraq. \"Similarly, if we take out Osama bin Laden and the al Qaeda, the power in Afghanistan will not just change hands. It will stay the way it is no matter who the leader is.\"\nU. Southern California\nAbout 60 University of Southern California students attended \"Target: America,\" a panel discussion of Middle Eastern politics sponsored by Program Board.\nThe panel of four discussed a variety of issues such as religion, domestic and international foreign policy, military action and their roles in terrorism in America.\nThe problem of terrorism is larger than Americans have made it out to be, Ritter said. Americans are eager for military action, even if it is pointed in the wrong direction, he said.\nIraq has been stripped of the capability to produce either weapons of mass destruction or biochemical weapons and should not be identified as the source of the anthrax, Ritter said, adding that he thinks the poisonous substance is coming from inside the United States.\nAdditionally, speakers said the label \"terrorism\" itself has not been adequately defined, and must be clarified to be used effectively in policies, said Richard Dekmejian, professor of political science.\n\"Terrorism is a very bad word -- but what exactly does it mean to the U.S. and the war on terrorism?\" Dekmejian asked.\nRitter criticized the U.S. government response.\n\"Our definition of global terror really means a war on global terrorists that kill Americans,\" Ritter said.\nRitter's ideas on how to solve the problems \"depend on if you want me to be a four- or eight-year president,\" he said. While he could make decisions that would get the job done, they would be unpopular with Americans, which would prevent a re-election.\nThe fundamentalist religions tend to have a propensity toward violence, said John Crossley, director of the School of Religion.\n\"In Judaism, Islam and Christianity, individuals have a need to conquer opposing ideas,\" Crossley said. \"Throughout time, if the ideas themselves did not conquer others, then force would be used. That is where bin Laden is coming from for religious fundamentalists.\"\nSteven Lamy, director of the School of International Relations, said America is looking at the next Cold War.\n\"Our current policy is one of containment, but that is not working, because in the traditional sense, nobody can be contained or isolated without negative results,\" Lamy said\nStudent reactions to the panel were mostly positive.\nDeb Wicox, a junior majoring in political science, said the panel opened her eyes to the variance of issues involved.\n\"I was intrigued by the encompassing answers given and the descriptions of the larger-scale issues the speakers provided,\" she said.\nRick Connoly, a senior majoring in political science, also gained new insight from the discussion.\n\"The panel was thorough and I saw new aspects of the topic that I didn't take into account previously.\"\n(C) 2001 Daily Trojan via U-WIRE\n\nLoad-Date: October 24, 2001"
