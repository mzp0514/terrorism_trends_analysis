Judges Winter, Cabranes and Straub\nBackground: The plaintiffs appealed from the denial of their motion to reopen a judgment dismissing the sovereign defendants pursuant to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. The plaintiffs argued that the FSIA’s tort exception applied. Ruling: The Second Circuit reversed and remanded. The court held that extraordinary circumstances existed warranting relief under Rule 60(b). Specifically, there was a discrepancy in the case law between when the tort exception and the terrorism exception should apply. This discrepancy caused the District Court’s error of law. Stephen A. Cozen of Cozen O’Connor for the plaintiffs-appellants; Michael L. Kellogg of Kellogg, Huber, Hansen, Todd, Evans & Figel for the defendant-appellee Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; Lawrense S. Robbins and Roy T. Englert Jr. of Robbins, Russell, Englert for the defendant-appellee Saudi High Commission for Relief of Bosnia and Herzegovina\nhttp://www.nydailyrecord.com/be-the-first-to-know/ Click here for more from this resource.\n© 2014 Dolan Media Newswires.
