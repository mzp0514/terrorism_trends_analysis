    "full text": "WASHINGTON - A U.S. military judge sentenced Osama Bin Laden's driver to a mere five months at Guantanamo Bay yesterday, ignoring prosecutors' requests for a 30-year sentence to deter would-be terrorists.\n\"I hope the day comes when you return to your wife and your daughters and your country, Inshallay [God willing],\" Navy Capt. Keith Allred, the presiding judge at the first U.S. war crimes tribunal since World War II, told Yemeni captive Salim Hamdan.\nHamdan, believed to be about 40, was found guilty by a military jury of supporting terrorism by driving for Bin Laden. But he was cleared of the more serious charges of conspiracy in a setback for the military and the Bush administration.\nThe jury imposed a sentence of 66 months, but Allred said the 61 months Hamdan has been held at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba would count against the sentence.\nWith five months left to serve, Hamdan's sentence would be up just before the next President takes office - although the military could hold him indefinitely as an \"enemy combatant.\"\nThe views of the next President on the military tribunals process will weigh heavily on whether Hamdan is released.\nHamdan, who was captured in Afghanistan in November 2001 and has denied abetting terrorism, raised both hands in elation as the sentence was announced and apologized to the victims of Al Qaeda terrorism - without admitting guilt.\n\"I personally present my apologies to them if anything what I did have caused them pain,\" Hamdan said.\nrsisk@nydailynews.com\n\nLoad-Date: August 8, 2008"
