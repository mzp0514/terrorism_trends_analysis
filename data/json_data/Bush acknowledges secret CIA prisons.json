All have been transferred, with the final 14 going to Guantanamo.\nNEW PROPOSAL Bush said when Congress sets up tribunals he wants, the terrorism suspects will be tried.\n---\nPresident George W. Bush said Wednesday that 14 high-profile terrorism suspects held secretly until now by the CIA have been transferred to the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to face military tribunals if Congress approves.\nThe group includes Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, thought to be the mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks. Bush said he had decided to \"bring them into the open\" after years in which they have been held by the CIA without charges in undisclosed locations abroad, in a program the White House had not previously acknowledged.\nThe announcement marked the first time the president had discussed the secret CIA program. He made clear he had fully authorized it. Bush defended the treatment the suspects had received, but would not say where the so-called \"high-value terrorist detainees\" had been held or the techniques used to extract information from them.\n\"This program has been, and remains, one of the most vital tools in our war against the terrorists,\" Bush said. \"Were it not for this program, our intelligence community believes that al-Qaida and its allies would have succeeded in launching another attack against the American homeland.\"\nThe government says the 14 terrorism suspects include some of the most senior members of al-Qaida captured by the United States since 2001, including close associates of Osama bin Laden, among them those responsible for the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000 in Yemen and the 1998 attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.\nRed Cross will monitor\nWith the transfer of the suspects to Guantanamo, which is run by the Defense Department, the International Committee of the Red Cross will monitor their treatment, Bush said. He used the speech to urge Congress to pass legislation that would authorize military commissions that put terrorism suspects on trial, to replace rules established by the administration but struck down in June by the Supreme Court.\n\"As soon as Congress acts to authorize the military commissions I have proposed, the men our intelligence officials believe orchestrated the deaths of nearly 3,000 Americans on Sept. 11, 2001, can face justice,\" Bush said, adding, \"To start the process for bringing them to trial, we must bring them out into the open.\" To that end, Bush sent Congress legislation proposing new rules for the commissions and detailing specific standards for the humane treatment of detainees. Yet the new White House legislative proposal adhers closely to the previous commission model. It retains several provisions the court found troublesome, including language that permits defendants to be excluded from their own trials.\nAt the same time, the Pentagon released a new Army Field Manual that lays out permissible interrogation techniques, and specifically bans eight methods that have come up in abuse cases.\nThe speech was the third in a series Bush is delivering on the war on terrorism in the days before the fifth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.\nProgram is criticized\nThe CIA program, though officially a secret, has been the subject of numerous news reports in recent months. By speaking publicly about it for the first time, the president presumably hopes to build support for it on Capitol Hill, and in the public.\nThe White House released biographies of all 14 of the suspects and details of their alleged offenses; they include such well-known Qaida operatives as Abu Zubaydah, who the administration said was trying to organize a terrorist attack in Israel at the time of his capture, and Ramzi Binalshibh, who authorities say helped facilitate the Sept. 11 attacks.\nHuman rights organizations were instantly critical of Bush's announcement.\n\"It's wonderful that at last the United States has acknowledged that these detention sites exist,\" said Larry Cox, executive director of Amnesty International USA, in an interview. But he described the program as \"a form of torture,\" and said the United States should suspend it.\nIn his speech, Bush resisted that characterization.\n\"I want to be absolutely clear with our people, and the world,\" the president said. \"The United States does not torture. It's against our laws, and it's against our values. I have not authorized it -- and I will not authorize it.\"\n---\nSTLtoday.com/current What do you think of the CIA prisons?
