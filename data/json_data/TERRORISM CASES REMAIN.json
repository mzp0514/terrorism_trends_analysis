    "full text": "The following acts of terrorism against Americans are among the cases in which at least one suspect remains at large:\n* The Feb. 26, 1993, bombing of the World Trade Center in New York, in which six people were killed and more than 1,000 injured. Abdul Rahman Yasin, an American-born Iraqi, is the only suspect still at large.\nSix others are in prison in the United States. Yasin is believed to be in Baghdad, where he fled in 1994 after the FBI questioned him.\n* The Dec. 21, 1988, bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in which 270 people were killed. Rewards of up to $8 million are being offered for the capture of Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa, believed to be in Libya.\n* The 1985 hijacking of the Mediterranean cruise ship Achille Lauro, in which a wheelchair-bound American, Leon Klinghoffer, was shot and thrown overboard. The mastermind of the attack, Mohammad Abu Abbas, surfaced in the Gaza Strip last year, where, accompanied by bodyguards, he granted interviews and then went back into hiding.\n* The June 1985 hijacking of a TWA airliner in which a U.S. Navy diver was murdered and the 1983 suicide bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, in which 241 Americans were killed. Authorities have identified the orchestrator in both cases as Imad Mughniyeh, the former security chief of the Hezbollah guerrilla group. He was reported last year to be in Lebanon or Iran, though he has not been seen in public since 1994.\n\nLoad-Date: October 18, 2002"
