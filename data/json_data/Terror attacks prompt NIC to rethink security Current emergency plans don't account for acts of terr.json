    "full text": "In accordance with a request by the state Board of Education, North Idaho\n College is updating its security and emergency policies to include strategies\n for responding to terrorist attacks.\n The college has existing crisis plans, said Mike Halpern, director of\n Campus Safety and Support Services at a board of trustees meeting Wednesday\n night, but, ''nothing in there suggests acts of terrorism.\"\n Halpern acknowledged that the chances NIC might be a terrorism target are\n slim but said the campus could be a site of a school shooting, like the one at\n Columbine High School in Colorado.\nAnd as of now, the school's emergency response teams are not where they\n need to be, he said.\n The school needs to improve its emergency training for employees, hire more\n security officers and work more closely with local police.\n ''We could do a better job,\" Halpern said. ''Sadly, sometimes it takes a\n September 11 to get us off our heels and move forward.\"\n The Office of Campus Safety will conduct a self-audit, he said, and by Nov.\n 6 will present to the state Board of Education a plan for how it intends to\n update campus security procedures.\n In other business Wednesday night, the board heard a draft of proposals NIC\n might support during the upcoming legislative session in Boise. Those\n included:\n Support for funding of a $2 million enrollment management center, because\n of steady growth in the college's enrollment.\n A request for $10 million to build a new professionaltechnical building at\n NIC's Workforce Training Center in Post Falls, or for $15 million to build a\n larger facility that would be used by both NIC and the University of Idaho.\n Support for ''more flexibility in setting tuition and fees,\" which can be\n a touchy issue, between students who want to keep tuition the lowest in Idaho\n and officials who are concerned about revenues.\n\nNotes\n\nJulia Silverman can be reached at (208) 765-7126 or by email at julias@spokesman.com  \n\nLoad-Date: October 30, 2001"
