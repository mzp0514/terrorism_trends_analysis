When asked if the other kids had done what he had, Brock admitted the other kids had not gone to the lengths he had, further admitting he had gone much further than any other kid had,\" according to the jail booking affidavit.\nPolice noted in their affidavit that if they had not \"found Brock when we did, it was very likely the wave pool may have been shut down and the public evacuated, preventing the occupation and operation due to the threat of it being shot at with a high-powered rifle.\"\n- Pat Reavy\n\nLoad-Date: December 20, 2019"
