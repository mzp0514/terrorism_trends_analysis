    "full text": "France's lower house of parliament overwhelmingly approved a new anti-terrorism bill Tuesday that would increase the use of video surveillance and allow police more time to question terror suspects.\nThe National Assembly voted 373-27 for the bill, which still needs to clear a Senate vote in January before becoming law.\nInterior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, leading efforts to strengthen laws against terrorism in response to deadly July bombings in London, sought to assure lawmakers the bill would not trample on civil liberties, as some fear.\nHe told the National Assembly the measures would allow police to pre-empt terror attacks and not work \"after the fact.\"\n\"This debate has paved the way for providing France with a more efficient arsenal,\" he said. \"The idea being that the worst should be avoided and that we must give greater powers to law enforcement to avoid a catastrophe.\"\nCommunist and Green party lawmakers voted against the bill, while the opposition Socialist Party abstained.\nThe bill would allow mosques, department stores and other potential targets to install surveillance cameras and would lengthen prison terms for terrorists and those supporting them.\nIt also would enable police to monitor people who travel to countries known to harbor terror training camps and would extend the detention period for terror suspects to up to six days.\nFrance already has some of Europe's toughest anti-terrorism laws, enacted after a wave of terror attacks in the 1990s by Algerian Islamic militants. But officials want to fill perceived gaps exposed by the London attacks on July 7 that killed 56 people - including four suicide bombers - and improve prevention.\n\nLoad-Date: November 30, 2005"
