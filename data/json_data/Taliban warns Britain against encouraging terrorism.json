    "full text": "KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (AP) - Afghanistan's Taliban rulers warned Britain Sunday that granting asylum to former hostages in an Afghan airline hijacking would encourage terrorism.\nAfter a standoff ended early Thursday at London's Stansted airport, 74 of the freed hostages from the Ariana Airlines Boeing 727 - almost half - requested asylum.\nTwenty-two others were arrested in connection with the hijacking.\nSpeaking at a news conference at the airport in Kandahar, Afghanistan, Taliban Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil said that if Britain grants asylum, it will encourage others to use hijacking as a means of fleeing to the West.\nThe released captives who chose to return to Afghanistan were expected to arrive at the airport within the next 24 hours aboard a chartered flight.\nThe plane was seized on Feb. 6 during what should have been a short domestic flight from the Afghan capital Kabul to the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif. But instead, hijackers took the plane to Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Russia before finally landing outside London.\nMuttawakil said the Taliban would welcome all the passengers home. Those who have asked for asylum would be welcomed, not punished, he said.\nIn the wake of the hijacking the Taliban have increased security at the country's airports and have deployed armed guards on all flights.\nBecause of United Nations sanctions imposed against the Taliban in November, Ariana Airlines is officially restricted from flying outside of the country. The sanctions were imposed to encourage the Taliban to hand over suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden for trial. The Taliban have refused.\n\nLoad-Date: February 15, 2000"
