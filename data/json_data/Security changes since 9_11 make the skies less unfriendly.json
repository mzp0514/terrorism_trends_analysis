    "full text": "Nineteen hijackers who boarded planes in small\ngroups in Boston, Newark and Washington on the\nmorning of Sept. 11, 2001, didn't so much evade\nairline security as walk boldly through its many gaps.\nTerrorism watch lists were of little bother. Box\ncutters were permitted on planes. Checkpoints were\nmanned by minimum-wage screeners\nworking for the lowest bidders\nwho won airline contracts. And once\non board, the hijackers faced obstacles\nas flimsy as the security on the\nground.\nToday, experts who complain that\nsecurity is still porous and just \"theater\"\nmust be suffering from amnesia.\nThe Transportation Security Administration\n(TSA), created in the weeks\nafter 9/11, has brought security a long\nway in the past 10 years. And while\nthe agency has had its share of missteps\nand failures, there's no question\nthat flying is far safer today than\nin 2001.\nOne of the most effective changes,\nhardening cockpit doors to make\nthem impassable, was accomplished\nin a matter of months, proving how\nmuch the government and industry\ncan accomplish when both are committed.\nMany pilots are now armed\nand trained to use guns in an emergency.\nAir marshals are deployed on\nmore flights.\nAll checked baggage is screened for\nexplosives, and TSA agents have taken\nover screening from private companies at the vast\nmajority of airports. Cargo in the bellies of domestic\npassenger planes is screened, too. At 78 airports,\nmany travelers pass through full-body scanners designed\nto detect explosives. And the TSA, albeit\nbelatedly, is finally checking passengers against\ncombined government watch lists — to detect dangerous\npeople, not just dangerous objects. For years,\nthe airlines carried out such work, a law enforcement\nfunction that never should have been jobbed\nout to the private sector.\nOf course, even all these steps cannot eliminate\nrisk. What they can do is make it harder for terrorists\nto succeed and less enticing for them to try.\nThat terrorists remain fixated on\nairplanes is certain, as evidenced by\nlast October's plot to ship parcel\nbombs on planes from Yemen to the\nUSA, and the \"underwear bomber\"\nwho tried to blow up a Detroitbound\njetliner on Christmas Day of\n2009. The parcel-bomb plot was\nfoiled by good intelligence and swift\ninternational cooperation, but it exposed\nholes in the screening of cargo\non international flights. The Christmas\nDay near-miss revealed gaps in\nintelligence sharing as well as the\nrole that alert, courageous passengers\ncan play in subduing terrorists.\nWhich brings us to another point\nabout passengers. They often show\nmore sense than the lawmakers who\nmake policy and oversee security. In\nNovember, amid an uproar over\nbody scanners and pat-downs, 71% of\nfliers said both were \"worth it\" to\nprevent acts of terrorism, according\nto a USA/Gallup Poll. Tellingly, the\nTSA's vocal critics failed to propose\nany credible alternative.\nThe TSA and its director, John Pistole,\nare taking some cautious steps\ntoward reducing the airport \"hassle\nfactor.\" Next month, the agency will\nstart testing a new way to identify\nfrequent fliers who are not risks and\ntreat them accordingly. Another\noverdue program would limit the\nscreening of children. On Tuesday, Homeland Security\nSecretary Janet Napolitano also mentioned allowing\npassengers to keep their shoes on — at some\nvague point in the future.\nWe hope this doesn't take another 10 years. Having\nthe nerve to decide when a procedure is no\nlonger necessary is as important as deciding to add\nyet another layer of security. \n\nLoad-Date: September 9, 2011"
