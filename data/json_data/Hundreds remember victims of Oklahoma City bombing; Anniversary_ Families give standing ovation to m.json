Murrah Federal Building and gutted what remained, killing 149 adults and 19 children.\nSeveral hundred people packed the First United Methodist Church for the ceremony, which included 168 seconds of silence at 9:02 a.m. - the time Timothy McVeigh's truck bomb exploded outside the building's day care center. McVeigh was executed in 2001 for the crime; codefendant Terry Nichols was sentenced to life in prison.\nThe blast also damaged the church, shattering its stained glass windows.\nOn Saturday, Thompson sat beside Cathy Miller, whose father was killed when a hijacked airliner crashed into his 100th-floor office at the World Trade Center in New York. The two became friends a few days after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks when Miller wrote an e-mail to the Oklahoma City National Memorial seeking help. Now they talk almost daily.\n\"I find it's really healing for me,\" said Miller. \"We're not here for each other just on the sunny days.\"\nOklahoma City Police chaplain Jack Poe, who counseled rescue workers pulling bodies from the building, led the mourners in prayer. \"Darkness can never, ever put out the light,\" he said. \"We're always coming to this place with a prayer in our heart and tears in our eyes.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \nphoto\n\nLoad-Date: April 20, 2003"
