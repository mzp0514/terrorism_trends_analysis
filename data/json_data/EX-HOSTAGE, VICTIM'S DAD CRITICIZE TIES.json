Send us a clear signal you're out of the business.'\"\nFlatow, Anderson and three other hostages held with Anderson in Beirut David Jacobsen, Joseph Cicippio and Frank Reed all sued Iran in American courts under a 1996 law allowing Americans to seek damages from nations that sponsor terrorism.\nIran declined to send any representative to court to respond to the lawsuits.\nFlatow won a judgment for $ 247.5 million. Jacobsen, Cicippio and Reed won judgments totaling $ 65 million. Anderson, whose nearly seven years in captivity in Lebanon made him the longest-held American hostage, is awaiting a federal judge's ruling on his request for $ 100 million.\nNobody has collected a penny. The Clinton administration has opposed efforts to collect the judgments from frozen Iranian assets, arguing that unfreezing the assets could result in retaliation against U.S. diplomatic properties abroad.\n\nLoad-Date: March 19, 2000"
