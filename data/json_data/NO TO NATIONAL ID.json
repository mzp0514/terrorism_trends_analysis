    "full text": "The Bush administration preaches from the White House pulpit about the virtues of liberty and freedom abroad, while systematically ignoring the same virtues domestically. While the right hand spies on and mocks habeas corpus, the left hand beats the drum about the righteousness of democracy and the necessity to go to war to protect it.\nThe administration hopes to strike civil liberties once more with its implementation of the Real ID Act, which essentially federalizes state drivers' licenses and creates a de facto national ID (\"Driver's License Detour?\" Jan. 12) -- this, to protect the liberties we are supposed to have from terrorism.\nThe program will infringe on what privacy we have left and enable the government to create a national database with information on all individuals. The potential for large-scale identity theft and terrorism will still exist. After all, if a terrorist organization is sophisticated enough to pull off 9/11, it is surely able to forge an ID card.\nThis is a national ID. Without public protest and absolute objection from the state legislatures, we approve of a surveillance state. I am not an alarmist, but I find the following quote from the Department of Homeland Security's Web site to be most alarming: \"The REAL ID Act requires that a REAL ID driver's license be used for 'official purposes,' as defined by DHS.\" The DHS is accountable only to the president, whoever he or she may be, and not to the public. \"Official purposes\" can mean anything in this brave new world.\n\nLoad-Date: January 31, 2008"
