But we still know too little about how Islamic fundamentalists use and abuse these groups.\"\nMost of the 6,000 Islamic groups operating worldwide are considered legitimate and provide emergency relief in dangerous and desperate places with the support of friendly states. In addition, the officials said, the charities are often unaware that terrorists have used them as cover.\n\"Most of these groups do some good works in some places,\" one official said. \"And often, only a few officials or a single chapter involving a small part of the charity's leadership or resources is being used.\"\nAlthough the Clinton administration has previously investigated alleged links between individual Islamic charities and specific terrorist groups, this is the first time that it is scrutinizing a block of such groups to determine whether they are being used, wittingly or not, by Islamic terrorist networks. As such, officials said, the inquiry is a major expansion of the government's counterterrorism efforts.\nIsrael has been pressing the United States for years to spearhead an international crackdown on Islamic charities and private relief groups. But officials said Washington had been reluctant to interfere in a domain safeguarded by constitutional guarantees of free association and separation of church and state. In addition, officials said, they lacked evidence that could be used in public court proceedings.\nIn recent months, U.S. officials have circulated within the government a list of more than 30 groups that they are examining for links to terrorism, at least two of which are based in the United States.\nIn January, a team of officials led by the Treasury Department visited Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and other Arab states to discuss specific charities with their Middle Eastern counterparts.\nU.S. officials said their investigations into the role of some Islamic charities and relief groups had been prompted by recent terrorist attacks and plots. The officials acknowledged that the scrutiny was politically and diplomatically sensitive.\nU.S. officials said charities could provide excellent cover for terrorist groups, because relief workers are welcomed almost everywhere and their shipments of supplies are rarely checked by border guards or the police.\nDiscovering the origins and supporters of such charities may be difficult, investigators said. While the United States, Canada and several European states require tax-exempt charities to file at least annual reports listing their assets, expenditures and officers, many states, including several in the Middle East, do not.\nOne instance in which investigators said they believed that the role of charities was crucial was the bombings of the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, crimes that killed more than 200 people and wounded thousands.\nProsecutors said material seized from the Nairobi office of the Mercy International Relief Agency includes records of calls to the cellular telephone of bin Laden. Another document found at the office, dated two weeks before the bombings, refers to \"getting the weapons from Somalia.\"\nMercy, based in Ireland, was one of five private associations that Kenya closed weeks after the bombing. The government said those groups had \"deviated from development objectives\" and \"posed a serious threat\" to Kenya's security.\nIn recent days, officials disclosed that a roommate of one the men charged with plotting to bomb targets in the United States had worked for Mercy in Dublin.\nThe State Department stepped up its efforts to investigate the charities late last year, after officials involved in counterterrorism work found that the United States government had inadvertently helped support questionable charities. The State Department had included a charity that counterterrorism officials say has ties to Sudan's governing Islamic party on a list of 50 groups through which Americans could aid refugees in Kosovo. The State Department has identified Sudan as a sponsor of terrorism.\nThe charity, the Islamic African Relief Agency, also received two grants in 1998 worth $ 4.2 million for work in Mali from the State Department's Agency for International Development.\nThe grants to the charity, which is one of the 30 being scrutinized, were cut off in December at the State Department's request on grounds that they were not in America's \"national security interests,\" an AID official said. The organization's president said he was appealing the decision.\nSpeaking from Columbia, Mo., where the charity has been registered since 1984, its director, Ahmed Mubarak, said his group had \"nothing to do with Sudan\" and that Washington had never accused it of any terrorist-related activity. \"We are simply trying to help people wherever they need help, Mubarak said.\"\nThe list of more than 30 groups with suspected ties to terrorists includes two based in the United States, the Global Relief Foundation Inc. and the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, based in Richardson, Texas.\n\nLoad-Date: February 25, 2000"
