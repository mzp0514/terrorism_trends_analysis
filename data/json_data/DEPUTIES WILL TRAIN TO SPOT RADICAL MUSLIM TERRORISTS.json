He plans to put on as many as five more $4,500 classes focused on Islamic terrorism.\nAnother $1,000 class for volunteer safety officers and honorary deputies is also scheduled.\nThat course includes lessons on how radical Muslims groom their facial hair and wear their pants, as well as a \"behavioral analysis technique to distinguish visually between moderates and radicals.\"\nThough the money makes up a minuscule portion of his $85.5 million budget, such spending could raise some eyebrows given White's recent decision to take his fight for another $4 million in funding to the governor and Cabinet.\nSpokesman Kevin Doll said the sheriff believes the money is well spent.\n\"Sheriff White believes it's appropriate training for our current world,\" Doll said.\nThe money for the deputies' courses comes out of the training budget, which is made up of state funds, not county property tax revenue, Doll said. Last year's total training budget was around $361,000.\nThe civilian course will be financed out of a separate fund, which also consists of state money, he said.\nThe courses at Pasco Hernando Community College will be led by Sam Kharoba, who runs a Coral Springs business called Counter Terrorism Operations Center.\nKharoba compared his course to the training law enforcement officers receive in dealing with gangs or drugs.\nOfficers in those cases learn about gang markings, for instance, or how to differentiate among drugs.\n\"The training I do makes an officer effective in identifying signs associated with jihad,\" Kharoba said.\nDoll noted that the 911 terrorists trained in Florida. \"Unfortunately, terrorism is a fact of life, and we want to be prepared for any attempts that might occur in Pasco,\" he said. \"Pasco is not a target-rich environment ... but that doesn't mean home-grown terrorists might not try something in the county.\"\nTimes researcher Shirl Kennedy contributed to this report.
