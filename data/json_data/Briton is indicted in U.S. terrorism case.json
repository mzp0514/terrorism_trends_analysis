    "full text": "A British computer specialist was indicted Wednesday on charges that he used U.S.-based Web sites to recruit al-Qaida, Taliban and Chechen fighters and outfit them with gas masks, night-vision goggles and camouflage gear.\nBabar Ahmad, 30, was arrested in London in August and has been held there for extradition to the United States.\nThe indictment accuses him of supporting terrorism, conspiring to kill Americans and laundering money.\nAhmad allegedly ran several sites, including Azzam.com, which investigators say was used to promote holy war and funnel money to terrorists.\nThe Web site allegedly encouraged people to train in street combat, land mine operations and sniper combat.\nFinancial donors were told to smuggle cash into Pakistan and pass it to the Taliban's consul general, investigators said.\n\"If you're supporting the Taliban and the Taliban is killing American soldiers, we're alleging you're conspiring to kill American citizens abroad,\" Connecticut U.S. Attorney Kevin O'Connor said.\nInvestigators said Ahmad also obtained classified military documents describing the movements and formations of a Navy battle group. He was exchanging e-mails with an enlisted man aboard the Navy destroyer Benfold, authorities said.\nAuthorities have not identified the man, who investigators said was sympathetic to the jihad cause.\nThe charges were filed in Connecticut because Ahmad allegedly used an Internet service provider in the state to host one of his sites.\nBabar also is charged with maintaining e-mail contact with a Chechen rebel leader.\nChechen rebels and their supporters have been blamed or taken responsibility for several terrorist acts in Russia, including a hostage-taking at a school last month that ended with more than 300 hostages dead.\n\nNotes\n\nWORLD\n\nLoad-Date: October 7, 2004"
