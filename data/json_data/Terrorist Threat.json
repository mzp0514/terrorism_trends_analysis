    "full text": "Financial institutions are prime targets for terrorist attacks abroad because the money obtained through robberies and kidnapings help fund the organizations, bankers were told here this week.\nIt is unlikely, however, that terrorism similar to that seen in Europe and the Middle East will be used soon by politically motivated groups in America, according to Charles Russell of Risks International, Inc., a research and publication firm here.\n\"American groups aren't very good,\" Mr. Russell said at a Bank Administration Institute conference on security.  \"They're really poor terrorists.\"\nHe said he does not expect terrorist attacks to increase in this country soon because of reluctance by professional terrorists abroad to provide military training to American revolutionary organizations.\nMr. Russell said that from 1970 through 1978 terrorists obtained $18.3 million as a result of bank robberies.\nThere were 91 known terrorist attacks against American banks during that period, most of them at foreign branches, he said.  These resulted in losses of $2 million in ransom money, $960,000 in damages and $440,000 in stolen property, he noted.\nMr. Russell observed that bankers are often kidnap victims \"because banks generally pay off.\"\n\"Bankers are the largest single group for plus-$1 million ransoms,\" according to Mr. Russell.  He said 11 of the 58 ransom requests by terrorists for amounts in excess of $1 million involved bankers.\nBanks have paid $20 million in ransom since 1970, he added."
