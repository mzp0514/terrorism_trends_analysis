Chains stood out against his white pants,  beige sweater and brown slip-on shoes.\nWhen the doors of Bruguiere's chambers opened, Carlos, a native of  Venezuela, said in French: \"Ah, here's the judge, how's it going?\"\n\"And you?\" Bruguiere replied.\n\"Still alive, for a long time to come,\" answered Carlos, whose death had  been rumored numerous times. Then, to his escorts, he added, \"This guy, he's  a star.\"\nBruguiere charged Carlos with \"complicity in voluntary homicide and  injuries and destruction by explosives leading to death and permanent  injuries.\"\nA panel of judges is expected to charge him later with the fatal shooting  of two counterintelligence agents in 1975. A French court convicted Carlos in  absentia in 1992 and sentenced him to life in prison for those slayings, but  he will have to be retried.\nCarlos is likely to languish in custody while the lengthy judicial  procedures drag on.\nCarlos' two attorneys are Oussedik and Jacques Verges, who has made a  career of defending notorious clients, including Gestapo chief Klaus Barbie  and Magdalena Kopp, a West German terrorist who married Carlos after a term in  French prison.\nThe 1982 bombing with which Carlos was charged was less bloody than other  crimes in which he is a suspect, including the 1975 attack on OPEC  headquarters and the 1976 hijacking of an Air France plane to Entebbe, Uganda.\nInterior Minister Charles Pasqua said Monday that Carlos was responsible  for at least 15 deaths in France and 83 worldwide.\nOussedik said his client's arrest was a \"mafioso deal\" between France and  Sudan. \"He was overpowered, bound, drugged. They gave him a shot . . . put a  mask on him and he was put on a French plane\" with French counterintelligence  agents.\nOussedik said he will sue the French government for kidnapping if his  client agrees.\nThe Justice Ministry said the conditions under which Carlos was brought to  France cannot be disclosed for national security reasons. Pasqua has insisted  that France promised Sudan nothing for handing over Carlos.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nBLACK AND WHITE PHOTO, Reuters; A van carrying Carlos arrives at Paris court Tuesday.\n\nLoad-Date: August 18, 1994"
