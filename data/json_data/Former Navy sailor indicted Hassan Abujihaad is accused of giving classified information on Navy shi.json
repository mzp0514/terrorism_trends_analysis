Messages seeking comment were left Wednesday with his attorneys.\nThe classified information involved a Navy battle group scheduled to move from California to the Middle East in the spring of 2001 to engage in missions against al-Qaida and the Taliban, according to the indictment. The material included a drawing of the group's formation when it was to pass through the Straits of Hormuz, which links the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman, at night under a communications blackout, the indictment states.\nThe investigation began at an Internet service provider in Connecticut and followed a suspected terrorist network across the country and into Europe and the Middle East.\n\nLoad-Date: March 22, 2007"
