    "full text": "The vice presidential debate characterized the differences between the Democrats and Republicans and also showed the attitude of the Democrats toward solving national problems.\nTo paraphrase, Vice President Joe Biden (he who laughs at everything) told us that the Republicans just need to \"get out of our way and let us get the job done.\"\nExcuse me, Joe, you and the president and the rest of your party had two years of controlling both houses of Congress and the presidency and what did you do? Pass a stimulus bill of so-called shovel-ready jobs that produced little employment improvement (the number of new jobs has actually been going down for the last few months), created several trillion dollars more of debt, provided no reasonable budget to deal with that debt (President Obama's budget proposals have been rejected by 97-0 and 96-0 the last two years) and passed the Obamacare bill that is a financial disaster.\nOn the foreign affairs side, the Obama administration bears responsibility for the death of four embassy employees in Libya including our ambassador. Our president refused to admit the attacks on 9-11-12 were driven by Islamic terrorism but instead originally blamed them on some obscure Islamic-related video that nobody has seen. Let us not forget the Fast and Furious fiasco that resulted in one death and transfer of hundreds of weapons to Mexican drug dealers.\nI've had enough of their \"get out of the way\" leadership.\nWAYNE ADAMSON\nAnnapolis\n\nLoad-Date: October 19, 2012"
