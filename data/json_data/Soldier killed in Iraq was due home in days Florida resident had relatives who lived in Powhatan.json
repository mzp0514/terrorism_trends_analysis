Osmolski, 23, died Feb. 5 in Balad, Iraq, after an improvised bomb exploded as he was searching a house in Muqdadiyah, Iraq, about 50 miles northeast of Baghdad.\n \"My son loved America, and he considered it a privilege\" to serve in the Army, his mother, Ruth Eileen Osmolski, said. \"He thanked God he was born an American.\"\n And, she said yesterday, \"My son brought us a lot of joy.\"\n Born in Eustis, Fla., Sgt.

Osmolski was assigned to the 2nd Brigade Special Troops Battalion, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, N.C. He was to return home this week.\n Sgt.
