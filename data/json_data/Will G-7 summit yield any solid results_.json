President Obama and the other G-7 leaders should be very careful about pushing Russian President Vladimir Putin too far.\nDennis Buckley\nWhat does the G-7 summit mean for most ordinary people? Nothing, because even if our \"leaders\" say there's a recovery, many of us see only poor workers. And the goal seems to be to make a war against Russia, which would destroy Europe.\nMarc Laurent\nObama should stop wasting time at the G-7 and get home to deal with the  U.S. debt, uncontrolled immigration, bloated government and racial tension.\nJohn Hipp\nIt's unlikely that proposed changes  will have any meaningful impact on the climate. The way to curb the influence of mankind is to stop population growth. Climate change is a perfect political issue. It allows politicians to spend more money while not being held accountable for the long-term results.\nLarry Gilbert\nIf you don't take care of terrorism, the climate will make no difference.\nChance Burton\nTerrorism is one of the most important issues for our society. For now, our officials appear to be doing little to fight the Islamic State, also known as ISIL.\nDan Rogers \n\nLoad-Date: June 10, 2015"
