    "full text": "The European Parliament approved on Wednesday a report admonishing 15 European countries and Turkey for helping the CIA transport terrorism suspects held in secret or for failing to cooperate in the parliament's investigation of the practice.\nThe legislative body for the European Union's 27 countries said many member states have been \"turning a blind eye\" to the CIA-operated flights carrying prisoners who were subjected to \"incommunicado detention and torture\" during interrogations, violating EU human rights standards. \n\"We have opened up a closed door and there is even more behind this,\" said parliament member Claudio Fava, an Italian Socialist who drafted the report.\nThe parliament criticized the CIA renditions - an extralegal tactic by which alleged terrorists have been abducted and interrogated at secret sites overseas - \"as an illegal instrument used by the USA in the fight against terrorism\" and condemned the \"acceptance and concealing of the practices by the secret services and governmental authorities of certain European countries.\"\nThe parliament deleted some of the toughest sections of the report, however, including recommendations for sanctions against some countries for human rights violations. It softened criticisms of some governments, including those of Britain, Germany and Spain, after intense lobbying from those states.\nParliament member Jas Gawronski of Italy criticized the final report as \"a blanket condemnation of the secret services\" and said it was \"predicated on the assumption that there is one chief guilty party and that is the USA.\"\nPresident George W. Bush acknowledged last September that the CIA used secret prisons to interrogate some terrorism suspects overseas. He did not say where the prisons were located.\n\nLoad-Date: June 26, 2007"
