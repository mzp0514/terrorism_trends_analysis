    "full text": "Of all the responses to the Mercaz  Harav murders, opinion columnist  Leonard Fein found mine the most  perplexing, even disturbing (What  Zionism Was Not Supposed To Be,  March 14). I, too, am perplexed, for  Fein never says where I erred.\nInstead of argument, we get claims  that I'm a master of manipulation  of sentiment and that I engaged  in seduction when I cited Chaim  Nachman Bialik and Natan Alterman.  What's manipulative about that?\nSomething else must be bothering  Fein. Could it be that though most of  us want peace now, we know that it  is unachievable, since the Palestinians  have not accepted our permanence?  Fein doesn't appear able to admit that,  and continues to pretend that there  must be a solution. Hamas won't  change, so Israel must.\nTherefore, Fein points incessantly  to Israel's failings. This time, he says  that Israel violated explicit agreements  made at Annapolis not to build in  Givat Ze'ev, when he ought to have  known that that's untrue. Much to  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's  chagrin, Israel never agreed not to  build there, insisting that the area is  part of Jerusalem, as Newton is to  Boston.\nIsraelis know that, short of disappearing,  there's nothing they can do  to end the conflict. So we struggle  to remain decent and alive, difficult  though that often is.\nDoes Fein really believe that if Israel  changed policies, the terrorism would  end? Surely he knows that's absurd.\nDaniel Gordis\nSenior Vice President  The Shalem Center  Jerusalem, Israel\n\nLoad-Date: April 7, 2008"
