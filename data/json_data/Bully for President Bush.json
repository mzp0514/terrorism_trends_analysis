    "full text": "Frankly I'm getting tired of the bashing of President George Bush. Let's break it down a bit. \n&#149 The Iraq War. I thought we should have not gone into Iraq in the first place (just as the Trib opined) But where were all of the tough questions from the Democratic Party from the beginning? \nDemocrats in the House and Senate went along with the war because of the fact that they were afraid of the political consequences of not voting for the war at the time. \nThe situation reminds me of when Bill Clinton was president when he would lick his finger and put it in the air to see the way the political wind blows. \n&#149 The Economy. I remember how hard Mr. Bush fought for the tax cuts. The cuts were minimal but still helped our economy expand. Since the tax cuts, we have seen millions and millions of new U.S. payroll jobs, and the federal treasury has had record receipts lowering our federal deficit. \nIf I recall, the Democratic Party was strongly against both the federal income tax cuts and the family tax credits Mr. Bush fought so hard to provide. Mr. Bush deserves credit for knowing his economics. \n&#149 Terrorism. The last I checked, we haven't had any terror attacks in the U.S. since 2001. Mr. Bush deserves credit for creating the Homeland Security Department and thwarting terrorism on our soil. \n&#149 Social Security reform. Mr. Bush tried to reform our failing Social Security system, the so-called \"holy grail\" of politics. Every other politician appears too cowardly to even address the issue. \nIf the Republican Party had any guts, it would have supported Mr. Bush's reform plans. \nChris Snyder \nMcCandless \n\nLoad-Date: August 11, 2007"
