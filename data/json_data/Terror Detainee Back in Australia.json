    "full text": "David Hicks, the Guantanamo Bay detainee who pleaded guilty to a terrorism charge, returned home to Australia on Sunday to complete his sentence, after more than five years in detention at the United States military base in Cuba.\n  Mr. Hicks, 31, was to be taken to the maximum security Yatala prison. He was sentenced in March to seven years in prison after he pleaded guilty to providing material support for terrorism. Under a deal with American prosecutors, most of his jail sentence was suspended and he will be able to walk free before Jan. 1, 2008.\nAt his trial, Mr. Hicks acknowledged that he had trained with Al Qaeda, fought American allies in Afghanistan in late 2001 for two hours, and then sold his gun to raise cab fare and tried to flee to neighboring Pakistan by taxi.\n  The Adelaide-born father of two was the first Guantanamo detainee tried by an American military tribunal.\n  His return to Australia marks the end of his long-running legal battle over his detention, which had threatened to become a major embarrassment to the Australian government.\n  Mr. Hicks, who was arrested in Afghanistan in late 2001 and sent to Guantanamo early the following year, was held for years without charge and spent significant amounts of time in solitary confinement.\n  In March, he made a surprise plea bargain, pleading guilty to providing material support for terrorism in exchange for being allowed to serve out his term on Australian soil.\n  Under the deal, he has agreed to withdraw all claims of mistreatment during his time in Guantanamo Bay and is barred from speaking to the news media for a year.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: May 20, 2007"
