Under U.S. law, that bars all but humanitarian aid to the North's government and rules out bank loans from international financial organizations, which are heavily influenced by Washington.\nThe two nations recently held talks in Pyongyang, the North's capital, on possibly removing the communist country from the list. The U.S. State Department called the meeting productive but did not disclose details.\nPyongyang was put on the list because of its alleged involvement in the bombing of a South Korean airliner in the skies near Myanmar, also known as Burma, in 1987. All 115 people aboard the Korean Air plane died.\nKim's comments on ties with the United States came last week during a meeting with executives of 46 South Korean media organizations who visited the Stalinist North, Yonhap reported. Kim invited the executives after he met with South Korean President Kim Dae-jung in Pyongyang in June - the first-ever summit between leaders of the two Koreas.\nThe North's leader told the executives he wants to visit South Korea \"at an appropriate time, but as soon as possible,\" Yonhap said. He had promised a visit during the summit.\nAlso Sunday, Yonhap quoted Kim as saying that North Korea will continue to develop what it calls scientific satellites for peaceful purposes. \"The U.S. would not want to give us money, but they want to stop our research,\" Kim was quoted as saying.\nNorth Korea shocked the region by firing a rocket over Japan and into the Pacific in 1998. It said it launched a satellite, but U.S. officials called it a test-firing of a long-range ballistic missile.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, who met with Kim Jong Il in July, told President Clinton at a summit of industrialized nations last month that North Korea was willing to abandon its missile program if other countries helped it launch space satellites. U.S. officials have expressed skepticism.\nOn a separate topic, Yonhap quoted Kim as saying the two Koreas will allow more reunions between families from each side in September and October. A first round of reunions between relatives who have not seen for a half-century begins Tuesday.\nThousands of South Koreans are believed to have gone to the North voluntarily or after being drafted into the North's army during the 1950-53 Korean War. An estimated 1.2 million North Koreans fled to South Korea before or during the war.\nSince the war, the two Koreas have been separated by a highly militarized border. There is no mail, telephone or other direct means of communication between private citizens.\nBut in the first round of reunions Tuesday, South and North Korea agreed to exchange 100 people each. It was one of a wave of goodwill gestures set in motion by the summit between the neighbors, and a major step toward reconciliation for a peninsula divided into the communist North and the pro-Western South since 1945.\nThe first reunions will let the 100 people from each side visit Seoul and Pyongyang, respectively. But by next year, separated families from South Korea will be allowed to visit their hometowns in the North, Yonhap quoted Kim as saying.\n\"The overall relations between the North and the South have developed in favor of national reconciliation, unity and reunification,\" Kim Jong Il was quoted as saying in a report Sunday by the North's foreign news outlet, KCNA.\n\nLoad-Date: August 20, 2000"
