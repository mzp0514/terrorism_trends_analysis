Muslim terrorists are resolved to launch a \"jihad\" (holy war) against Americans, Jews and Christians.\n#TESTA.S13s166#\nAmerica is witnessing what Christians in other parts of the world have been enduring for some years. Countries like Afghanistan, home of Osama bin Laden, and the radical Taliban Muslims, Algeria, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Pakistan, Sudan and others, even Saudi Arabia, have been carrying out continual terrorism against their own people who convert to Christianity -- terrorism in the form of torture, burning of churches, slavery of women and children, and murder.\nThese are countries that have supported years of terrorism against Israel. At this hour, these countries have given hypocritical statements of disapproval of the attack on the World Trade buildings and the Pentagon, yet they are the very ones who have harbored, applauded and supported terrorism and anti-American, anti-Israel activity.\nYasser Arafat, a long-known terrorist whom even the Arab state of Jordan had to exile for terroristic activity before he took up Palestinian terrorism in Israel, has been supported by those countries because of their united agenda to destroy the State of Israel.\nAmerica needs to take a new position in relationship with those nations that support any form of terrorism whether against America, Israel or Christians within their own borders.\nIt's time for open, honest exposure of a network of terrorism that exists throughout the Middle East and parts of Africa, and for the United States to take new, tough, corrective positions toward those countries or organizations involved in terrorism.\nFrank Testa\nChristiana\n\nLoad-Date: September 15, 2001"
