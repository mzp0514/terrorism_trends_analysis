Two French citizens jailed in southern Italy since last year are important point-men in Europe for al-Qaida and might have been planning attacks abroad, Italian anti-terrorism officials said Tuesday. The officials said the two men were being served warrants on Tuesday accusing them of being terrorists. The men have been held in Bari since November when they were arrested on suspicion of helping illegal immigration. \"They are two important point-men in Europe\" for al-Qaida, said Claudio Garzellano, an official of Italy's anti-terrorism police division UCIGOS, on Italian state radio. The two are suspected of recruiting militants for al-Qaida in Afghanistan and spreading terrorism propaganda, Garzellano said. Authorities scheduled a news conference for later Tuesday in Bari. Italian radio said that based on intercepted conversations, the two men are suspected of planning attacks abroad. The Italian news agency ANSA said the alleged plans involved Charles De Gaulle airport outside Paris, but Garzellano said there was no hard proof any concrete plots had been worked out. Police said the two men had been arrested in Bari after clandestine migrants were found in their truck, and that CDs, DVDs and pen-drives containing material inciting terrorism were found in the vehicle. Belgian intelligence authorities informed Italy that the men were suspected of planning terrorism, ANSA said.  \n\nLoad-Date: May 12, 2009"
