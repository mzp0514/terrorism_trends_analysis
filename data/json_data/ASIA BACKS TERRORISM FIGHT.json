They fear a Muslim backlash could spread instability, especially if the U.S.-led attacks continue through the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which begins in mid-November.\nMalaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, while opposed to the military action, said the use of ground troops was preferable to air raids because civilians are less likely to be killed by soldiers than by bombs.\nBush got backing for the military effort from Russia and China, and at a news conference Sunday following a private meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, he said he was encouraged by the overall support at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.\n\"There was a very strong support for our activities strong support for sharing intelligence; strong support for the diplomatic front we're waging; strong support to disrupt the financial operations of the terrorists; and strong support for our military operations in Afghanistan,\" Bush said.\nPutin said the military campaign should continue until the Taliban militia is defeated, adding that \"otherwise terrorists will feel invincible.\"\nAfter a meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Saturday, Putin's spokesman had said the two agreed that military operations should stop quickly so a political solution can be found in Afghanistan.\nAPEC leaders said the terrorism crisis has affected the slowing global economy. \"Terrorism is also a direct challenge to APEC's vision of free, open and prosperous economies, and to the fundamental values that APEC members hold,\" the forum statement said.\n\nLoad-Date: October 22, 2001"
