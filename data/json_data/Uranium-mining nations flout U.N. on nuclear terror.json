Among the more than 160 governments that have reported, the information supplied is often sketchy.\nResolution 1540, which set a reporting deadline of October 2004, \"imposes strict reporting requirements on states, but few have fully met them,\" the International Commission on Nonproliferation and Nuclear Disarmament, a prestigious study group, concluded in its final report last December.\nMexican U.N. Ambassador Claude Heller, chairman of the U.N. committee monitoring 1540's implementation, said he plans a series of meetings with noncompliant states to urge cooperation, and he sees Obama's summit as a chance to \"send a strong message\" about the U.N. mandate's importance.\n\"It is a legally binding regime that was adopted by the Security Council,\" Heller told The Associated Press. \"It is not up to governments to say yes we will report or not.\"\nResolution 1540, promoted by the U.S. in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks and the 2004 uncovering of the Pakistan-based A.Q. Khan nuclear smuggling network, is the only global legal instrument designed to disrupt links between terrorists and nuclear technology. The U.N. mandate obligated all nations.\nIt required governments to \"adopt and enforce appropriate effective laws which prohibit any non-State actor,\" such as terrorists, from making or possessing nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, their delivery systems or related material. Governments must establish \"effective\" border and export controls and physical protection for sensitive materials and sites.\nAn AP review of filings found vast differences in national reporting.\nThe U.S. and other industrialized nations filed reports of up to 30,000 words detailing relevant laws and how they are enforced, while other, smaller countries submitted reports of just a few hundred words.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nFILE - In this April 10, 2004 file photo, a man enters a tunnel dug with shovels in the Shinkolobwe cobalt mine, 35km (22 miles) from the town of Likasi in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Khan, glorified by many of his countrymen but reviled by Western governments. Khan's nuclear smuggling network was one of the reasons the U.N. passed Resolution 1540 in 2004, obligating governments to give a full accounting of their nuclear materials. Yet more than five years after the deadline passed, many have yet to fully comply.
