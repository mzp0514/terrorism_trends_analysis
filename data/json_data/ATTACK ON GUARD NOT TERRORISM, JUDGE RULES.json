    "full text": "A judge ruled yesterday that a jailed Al Qaeda thug was not acting as a terrorist when he stabbed a Manhattan prison guard in the eye - meaning he could be facing as little as 17 years behind bars instead of life.\nThe decision outraged the family of Metropolitan Correctional Center guard Luis Pepe, who suffered severe brain damage when was attacked with a sharpened comb Nov. 1, 2000.\n\"You can take someone's life away, and you don't have to get life for it,\" fumed Pepe's sister, Eileen Trotta.\nManhattan Federal Court Judge Deborah Batts ruled the vicious attack was not a federal crime of terrorism because it did not transcend national boundaries.\nThat means Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, 42, faces 17 1/2 years to 21 years and 10 months under federal sentencing guidelines, Batts wrote.\nTrotta, 48, of Queens, said her brother, who has trouble speaking, was furious.\n\"He was trying to say that terrorists around the world are laughing because they got away with it,\" she told the Daily News.\nIn the background, her 35-year-old brother could be heard yelling, \"Bad, bad.\"\nSalim said last year that he tried to kill Pepe out of frustration that he could not fire his lawyers at the time.\nWhen he attacked the jailer, Salim was being held as a suspect in the 1998 bombings of two American embassies in East Africa. That case is pending.\nProsecutors were studying the ruling, said a spokesman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jim Comey.\n\"It was a very gutsy decision,\" said Salim's attorney Richard Lind.\n\nLoad-Date: September 26, 2003"
