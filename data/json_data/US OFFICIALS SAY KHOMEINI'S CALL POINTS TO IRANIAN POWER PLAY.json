    "full text": "The death threats against novelist Salman Rushdie are generally interpreted in Washington as a sign that the Ayatollah Khomeini is still in charge and that the radicals in Iran's leadership have found a new means to inflame him.\n''It was a brilliant stroke by those who brought this issue to him,'' sums up one ranking United States official, ''even if it very poorly serves Iran.''\nBy tapping Khomeini's passion for protecting the purity of Islam no matter what the costs, the hard-line revolutionaries have found a means to increase their influence in Tehran, he says.\nAt a minimum, adds a senior official, it reinforces the conclusion that there will be no movement soon on the issue of American hostages in Lebanon or on US-Iranian relations.\nThe question still being debated here is how much this has tilted the power balance inside Iran.\nA top European terrorism specialist says the Rushdie incident marks a change in strategy for keeping the revolution alive. Rather than relying on traditional modes of terrorism - hijackings, bombings, kidnapings - to strike out at the West, Tehran's radicals have won the Ayatollah's support for striking out in very public, media-focused ways.\nThis specialist's sources say more such ''public terrorism'' will follow. This type of public action could be attractive to the Ayatollah, say US officials, as a means of reviving the fervor of a revolution badly demoralized by its loss to Iraq and the difficult postwar problems Iran faces."
