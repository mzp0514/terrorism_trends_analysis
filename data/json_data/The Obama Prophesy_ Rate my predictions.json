One such prediction appeared in The Journal on June 10,2009, titled \"An Obama Prophesy\" and the writer promised to submit another article in four years which would \"either confirm he was wrong, or will tell you, I told you so.\" Here they are - published in two installments. Please send reader comments to: news@journalpress.com\nPrediction: The first prediction was that Obama's \"...victory virtually assures that off-shore drilling for America's vast deposits of crude oil and natural gas and the recovery of the vast deposits of oil shale along the continental divide will remain off-limits. This will leave us dependent on foreign energy, deprive us of 1 million new jobs, and allow the price of gasoline to return to $4 per gallon, or higher. His \"coal-use tax\" and refusal to commit to nuclear energy will drive up the cost of electricity and increase unemployment. Obama is likely to deplete America's small strategic oil reserve in an attempt to keep rising oil prices down, making the impact of an oil embargo catastrophic. All of this will cause a great hardship on American's and could destroy our economy.\"\nResult: This prediction has proven 100% accurate. Obama cancelled most existing oil permits issued by the Bush Administration; changed the recommendation of his \"Blue Ribbon Panel\" to continue \"off-shore drilling\" without consulting them and banned off-short drilling in the Gulf and the East coast; sold a portion of our strategic oil reserve to keep prices from temporarily rising; restricted the petroleuim industry's ability to access new oil reserves on federal property; increased environmental regulations that impacted existing supplies and the price of a gallon of gasoline has doubled since he took office. He's done nothing material to advance nuclear energy except \"lip service;\" has virtually crippled the coal industry, and has issued regulations that are impacting electrical generation stations with the intent to increase the price of electricity. This has taken money out of everyone's pocket, increased unemployment, made goods and services more expensive; and hurt our oil driven economy more than anyone can imagine.\nPrediction: The 2nd prediction was \"the stimulus (spending) package is filled with liberal programs that could not be passed while the Republicans controlled Congress. It will fail to provide immediate stimulus, will delay the recovery and increase the size of government. Obama's obsession with protecting the environment from perceived threats will further delay the economic recovery and possibly result in a depression...\"\nResult: This has also proven true, except for a possible depression that still looms ahead as \"out of control spending continues.\" The Federal government has increased by leaps and bounds while the recovery hasn't occurred and cannot, based on his current policies. The EPA has slowed the recovery with new regulations.\nPrediction: The 3rd prediction was \"the path to socialism has been set on a course that will start by increasing both big government and taxes on the rich. This will progress downward and the 'new rich' will be those that work and pay taxes...\"\nResult: Big government is here and he continues to press for taxes on what he calls the rich. Obamacare imposes 14 taxes on the middle class, fines those that don't have health insurance and even collects a tax on the middle class if they sell their home, reducing their equity.\nPrediction: The 4th prediction was \"he will establish a national police force...America will be less safe and will be exposed to international terrorism, increasing the threat of another September 11th perhaps this time involving weapons of mass destruction.\"\nResult: Homeland security has grown by leaps and bounds and is our new national police force. North Korea has developed long range missiles and recently said they can strike the Continental US. Egypt is now controlled by the Muslim Brotherhood, our Embassy in Libya was attacked and our Ambassador was killed because his request for additional security was repeatedly denied; Iran is progressing on their nuclear weapons, if they don't already have them; and terrorism has never been a greater threat. His response is to reduce our armed forces to the lowest level they have been since before World War II by reducing our defense budget by 1 trillion dollars over the next ten years.\nPrediction: The 5th prediction was \"his health plan doesn't provide any new additional doctors or nurses... create any medical facilities, nor does it address frivolous lawsuits...\"\nResult: There remains a serious shortage of doctors, nurses and facilities to care for the estimated 22 to 42 million new patients under Obama- * care that are about to enter the system. The claim there would be 1 trillion in savings has disappeared and the Congressional Budget Office estimates the predicted cost has doubled. $718 billion was removed from Medicare to fund Obamacare and now Medicare is under-funded. Health costs continued to increase faster than the inflation and many companies are dropping health plans because they can't afford Obamacare. The President said you can keep your health plan, he just forgot to say you won't be able to afford it.\nPrediction: The 6th prediction was \"a hasty withdrawal from Iraq will destabilize the Middle East and increase Iran, Syria and al Qaeda's sphere of influence and will allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons...\"\nResult: There is turmoil in the Middle East. Egypt is no longer our close ally and we are in greater danger from terrorism than in any point in our past history.\nThere isn't room to discuss my other prophesies in this issue. This should be a good start to make my point. How did I do? Please send comments to: news@journalpress.com\n\nLoad-Date: March 22, 2014"
