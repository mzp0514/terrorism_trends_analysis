    "full text": "Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh claimed Monday that there was a foreign link to bombings that bloodied two New Delhi markets, a veiled reference to Pakistan-based militants. But both nations sought to preserve the fragile d√©tente that grew out of the recent quake disaster.\nPakistani President Pervez Musharraf condemned terrorism and pledged full cooperation in the bombing investigation. The attack came three weeks after an earthquake ravaged the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir and helped draw the two nuclear rivals closer.\nDuring a phone call Monday, Singh reminded Musharraf of \"Pakistan's commitment to ending cross-border terrorism and said that he continued to be disturbed and dismayed at indications of external linkages\" to the attack, said Sanjaya Baru, a spokesman for the Indian leader.\nBut Baru refused to provide any details about the purported foreign links to the bombs that killed 59 people and wounded 210 -- or to single out Pakistan by name.\nPakistani officials were quick to condemn the bombings over the weekend, and Musharraf on Monday called the bloodshed in New Delhi \"a dastardly terrorist attack.\" He said his country would fully cooperate in any investigation.\n\"Pakistan stands with India on this act of terrorism which has been perpetrated in New Delhi,\" he said.\n\nNotes\n\n World \n\nLoad-Date: November 1, 2005"
