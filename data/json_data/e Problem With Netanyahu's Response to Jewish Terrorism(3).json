Christian tradition calls it the  Hill of Evil Counsel, where the high priest Caiaphas  consulted his aides before ordering Jesus arrested.\nIn Hebrew it's known as Armon  HaNatziv, the Commissioner's  Palace, after the gleaming white  mansion on the crest. It once housed  the British mandatory government  and is now United Nations headquarters,  giving new life to the name Hill  of Evil Counsel. Looping the hillside  is the Tayelet, the lovely promenade  built by the Haas and Goldman families,  heirs to the Levi Strauss fortune.\nStretching southward behind the  palace is East Talpiot, a nondescript  middle-class Jewish neighborhood  built in     . It's one of the earliest  Jerusalem suburbs to rise on  land captured in the      Six-Day  War. What sets it apart are its street  names: In a wry, one-finger salute to  the palace's onetime British overlords,  nearly all the streets in East Talpiot  are named after Jews convicted and  hanged as terrorists by the British  before     .\nThat's right: Israeli streets named  after Jewish terrorists. Don't let  anyone tell you di  erent.\nThere were    of them: nine  members of the Irgun and three from  the Stern Group, or Lehi. Two were  hanged for assassinating the British  minister Lord Moyne in Cairo in     .  One unsuccessfully attacked an Arab  civilian bus in the Galilee in     .  Three participated in the      Acre  prison break. The rest attacked British  security personnel.\nIn addition to streets named for  each individual, the neighborhood's  main drag bears the name by which  they're collectively remembered: Olei  HaGardom, those who ascended the  gallows. Dozens more cities around  Israel have an Olei HaGardom Street.  Many have streets named for the individual  members, too.\nTwo other streets in East Talpiot are  named for Shmuel Azar and Moshe  Marzouk, Egyptian Jews hanged  in Cairo in      for bombing the  American and British libraries. The  operation, known as the Lavon A  air,  was a bone-headed plot by Israeli military  intelligence meant to sour Egypt's  ties with the West. Elsewhere in Israel  are streets named for Hirsh Lekert,  hanged in Vilna in      for trying  to assassinate the tsarist governor;  Sholom Schwartzbard, who confessed  to assassinating Ukrainian rebel leader  Simon Petlura in Paris in     , but\nwas acquitted by a French jury; and  Herschel Grynszpan, who assassinated  a Nazi diplomat in Paris in November      , touching o  Kristallnacht.\nThey're all remembered with reverence  and gratitude for their courage  in facing death and their devotion  to Israel and the Jewish people. But  there's another reason we should  remember them. Israel's Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu has a habit  of declaring that Palestinians name  streets after terrorists and Israelis  don't, and that this is an essential  di  erence between the two. It's not  true. Facts matter.\nWe denounce and condemn the  murderers, Netanyahu told his cabinet  on August  . We chase them  down. They name public squares after  the murderers of children, and this  di  erence can't be covered up.\nHe said the same thing a year ago,  in his condolence message to the  family of Mohammed Abu-Khdeir. The    -year-old had been burned alive by  Jewish thugs on July  ,     , in apparent  revenge for the murders of three  yeshiva students in June.\nI know that in our society, the society  of Israel, there is no place for  such murderers, the prime minister  said on July  , after the suspects  were arrested. And that's the di  erence  between us and our neighbors.  They consider murderers to be heroes.  They name public squares after them.  We don't. We condemn them and we  put them on trial and we'll put them  in prison.\nThere are three reasons why the  prime minister shouldn't be speaking  this way. For one thing, it's  wildly inappropriate. Israelis rightly  complain when Palestinian leaders  express regret for attacks on Israelis,  but then hedge it with excuses or  trash-talk about what's wrong with  Israel. The second part undoes the  good in the opening words. Israelis  should know better than to do the  same thing.\nThe Palestinian public feels, much  as Israelis do, that an attack like  the arson murder in Duma village  is an attack on all of them. Palestinians  need, just like Israelis at such a  moment, to hear from the other side  that it understands and shares their  grief. Statements like Netanyahu's   which boil down to It's too bad but  it's not our fault and anyway you're  worse  don't cut it. The moment  calls for solace, not insult.\nSecond, it's the wrong thing to say  to the Israeli public. The vast majority  of Israelis are appalled by the  Duma arson-murder, but a dangerous  minority objects to the public's  outpouring of grief. Police are investigating  a flood of threats that greeted  Israel's President Reuven Rivlin when  he spoke out this month against the  flames of hatred threatening Israeli  democracy. Protesters, incensed that  he dared criticize Israelis and sympathize  with Arabs, are calling him  traitor, terrorist, president of the  Arabs and worse. They mustn't be  allowed to feel the prime minister has  their back.\nNetanyahu has been complaining  for years that Palestinian terrorism,  even when perpetrated by lone wolves  without organizational backing, draws  inspiration from the inflammatory  words of Palestinian leaders, starting  with Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian  Authority president. Abbas's incitement,  it turns out, consists mainly of  repeated harangues about Israeli ill  will and mistreatment of Palestinians.  Apparently, constantly telling your  people that the other guys are out  to get you can inspire some of your  people to go get them. That's something  to watch out for.\nFinally, the prime minister must  surely know his words aren't true.  There's all too much room in Israel  for these creeps. As the Shin Bet security  agency is now acknowledging,  settler violence against Palestinians  in the West Bank, largely discounted  for years, is becoming a crisis. Property  vandalism, burning of fields and  cutting down olive trees have long  been endemic. Most perpetrators are  never caught. Most of those arrested  are let o  with a slap on the wrist  or less. Now, though, the agency says  the violence is morphing into an  armed conspiracy. Law enforcement  authorities recommended stepped up  measures a year ago, but Netanyahu  vetoed them.\nEven if that crisis didn't exist, there  would still be those street names to  rebuke the prime minister. Israel still  celebrates the gunmen of pre-state  Israel who attacked British soldiers  and Arab civilians as well as defending  Jews and were hunted down as  terrorists. And no wonder. Like Jomo  Kenyatta in Kenya, Nelson Mandela  in South Africa and our own George  Washington, hunted terrorists and  traitors all, those gunmen helped  win their country its freedom. That's  the way of the world. Some are  more bloodthirsty than others. Some  become democrats, others tyrants. But  the principle is the same. It's only after  independence, when there's a state to  monopolize armed violence, that folks  will stop hailing their gunmen as freedom  fighters and start calling them  criminals.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nIMAGE\nIMAGE: Victim o Arson:18-month-oldAli Saad Dawabshe was killed inan attack on his home in Duma.; GETTY IMAGES\n\nLoad-Date: August 16, 2015"
