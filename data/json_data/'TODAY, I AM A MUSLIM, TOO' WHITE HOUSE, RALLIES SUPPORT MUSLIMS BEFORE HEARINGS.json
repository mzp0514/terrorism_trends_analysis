    "full text": "STERLING, Va. -- Muslim Americans are not part of the terrorism problem facing the United States -- they are part of the solution, a top White House official said Sunday at a Washington-area mosque.\nDeputy National Security Adviser Denis McDonough set the Obama administration's tone for discussions as tensions escalate before the first in a series of congressional hearings on Islamic radicalization Thursday. The hearings, chaired by New York Republican Peter King, will focus on the level of cooperation from the Muslim community to help law enforcement combat radicalization.\nThe majority of the recent terror plots and attempts against the U.S. have involved people espousing a radical and violent view of Islam. Just a few weeks ago a college student from Saudi Arabia who studied chemical engineering in Texas was arrested after he bought explosive chemicals online. It was part of a plan to hide bomb materials inside dolls and baby carriages and blow up dams, nuclear plants or the Dallas home of former President George W. Bush.\nMr. King said the Muslim community could and should do more to work with law enforcement to stop its members from radicalizing and recruiting others to commit violence.\n\"I don't believe there is sufficient cooperation\" by American Muslims with law enforcement, Mr. King said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"Certainly my dealings with the police in New York and FBI and others say they do not believe they get the same -- they do not give the level of cooperation that they need.\"\nIn New York City on Sunday, about 300 protesters gathered in Manhattan's Times Square to speak out against Mr. King's hearing, criticizing it as xenophobic and saying that singling out Muslims, rather than extremists, is unfair.\nMr. McDonough said that instead of condemning whole communities, the U.S. needs to protect them from intimidation.\nHe spoke to an interfaith forum at a Northern Virginia mosque known for its longtime relationship and cooperation with the FBI. The executive director of the center, Imam Mohamed Magid, also spoke, as did speakers from a local synagogue and a Presbyterian church.\nThe administration has tried to strike a balance on the thorny issue, working to go after homegrown Islamic extremists without appearing to be at war with the Muslim world. There has been an effort to build stronger relationships with Muslims -- internationally and in the United States.\nDuring his remarks Sunday, Mr. McDonough called the mosque a \"typically American place\" and said it reminded him of his Catholic parish where he grew up in Minnesota.\n\"Being religious is never un-American. Being religious is quintessentially American,\" he said.\nHe commended the mosque's members for taking \"an unequivocal stand against terrorism.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO: Henny Ray Abrams/Associated Press: A protester carries a sign at the \"Today, I Am A Muslim, Too\" rally in New York City on Sunday against a planned congressional hearing on the role of Muslims in homegrown terrorism.\n\nLoad-Date: March 7, 2011"
