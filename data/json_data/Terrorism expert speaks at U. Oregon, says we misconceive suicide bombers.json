The photo, taken from a video made by the Tamil Tigers, showed the last second of Gandhi's life. The woman blew up herself, Gandhi and several bystanders, not as an act of Islamic zealotry, but as part of an organized political campaign.\n\"Fifty percent of suicide attacks are not affiliated with Islamic terrorism,\" Pape said.\nIf Islamic fundamentalism were truly the cause of suicide terrorism, Pape said, we should see terrorists \"hopping out of Iran, hopping out of Sudan, hopping out of Pakistan,\" three of the countries with the largest populations of Muslims.\nOf them, Iran and Sudan have produced no suicide terrorists, and Pakistan has produced only two, Pape said. The majority of terrorists in Iraq, Pape said, are Iraqi Sunnis, Saudis, Syrians and Kuwaitis, or people from the surrounding countries on the Arabian Peninsula, where U.S. troop levels have risen from 12,000 in 1990 to more than 140,000 today.\nAs part of his research, which has been used by the Central Intelligence Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency , Pape has compiled the first complete database of all suicide terrorist attacks from 1980 to 2004. He shows the number of suicide attacks to be rising dramatically in recent years, from three per year in the 1980s, to 10 per year in the 1990s, to more than 25 per year in 2000 and 2001 and more than 50 per year in 2002 and 2003.\n\"Al Qaeda is stronger today than before 9/11,\" Pape said.\n\"Rightly or wrongly,\" Pape said, \"democracies are viewed as especially soft, or vulnerable to suicide terrorism.\"\nThe individual terrorists are often more highly educated than most of their countrymen and are often working or middle-class, Pape said.\n\"Many are people who would go on to lead productive lives if they didn't choose to participate in terrorist attacks,\" Pape said.\nPape argued that to protect our troops and access to Iraqi oil, we need to transfer control of the Iraqi military to the Iraqi government and gradually withdraw our troops.\n\"Our enemies have been dying to win,\" Pape said. \"But it is America that is poised for victory.\"\n(C) 2006 Oregon Daily Emerald via U-WIRE\n\nLoad-Date: March 10, 2006"
