    "full text": "Barack Obama\nIf for no other reason, I would vote for Barack Obama because the next president's appointments to the Supreme Court will impact the country's direction and success into mid-century and beyond.\nThose of us who are prochoice, who do not believe corporations are people, who seek a level playing field for all and who think Franklin Roosevelt, a son of privilege, was correct when he told the American people that from those to whom much is given, much is expected, will vote with confidence for Obama. He has repeatedly demonstrated his willingness and ability to serve the interests of all the people.\n? Walter Gray, Middleton\nMitt Romney\nI had a hard time making up my mind about president.\nI finally decided to support Mitt Romney because President Barack Obama showed he is not prepared to lead in an emergency.\nThe truth about what happened at our consulate in Benghazi, Libya, proved to me Obama doesn't have a clue about who our enemy is. He still cannot utter the words \"Islamic terrorism\" after all these years.\nObama is too weak to be commander in chief. Killing Osama bin Laden did not make him a strong leader, and his lack of support for our men in Benghazi showed him to be a weak one.\n? James D. Curtin, Madison\nWhom do you support for president? Tell us in 100 or fewer words, emailed to wsjopine@madison.com Please include your name, address and phone number for verification, and type \"I'm voting for\" in the subject line.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHIL HANDS ?
