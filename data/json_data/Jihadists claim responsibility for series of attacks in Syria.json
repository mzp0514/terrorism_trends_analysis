    "full text": "BEIRUT - An al-Qaida-inspired group claimed responsibility for dozens of attacks across Syria, the latest evidence that extremists are exploiting the chaos to make inroads into another Middle Eastern country.\nThe Syrian regime has long blamed terrorists for the 16-month-old revolt, and the presence of al-Qaida groups creates new difficulties for Arab and Western countries trying to help force President Bashar Assad from power.\nThe opposition and the rebel Free Syrian Army deny having any links to terrorism, and say they do not have the desire or the capabilities to carry out massive suicide bombings and other al-Qaida-style attacks.\nOn Tuesday, the SITE monitoring group, which tracks jihadist chatter on the Internet, said the Al-Nusra Front released statements on extremist websites in late June claiming the attacks were to avenge the killings of Syrians by the government.\nOne of the attacks targeted a television station in the town of Drousha, south of the capital, Damascus, on June 27. Seven people were killed in the attack on Al-Ikhbariya TV.\nAl-Nusra said that the station was an arm of the regime and that the attack sought to make the station \"taste from the cup of torture\" and force every member of the regime to wonder: \"When will my turn come?\" The statement included photos of 11 men it said were kidnapped in the attack.\nAl-Ikhbariya is privately owned but often acts as a regime mouthpiece.\nOther attacks in the latest claim of responsibility include dozens of armed raids and bombings - including suicide bombings - in Syrian cities.\nLittle is known about Al-Nusra, although Western intelligence officials say it could be a front for a branch of al-Qaida militants from Iraq operating in Syria. The group has claimed responsibility for a string of attacks in Syria, including suicide bombings, in the past.\n\nLoad-Date: July 6, 2012"
