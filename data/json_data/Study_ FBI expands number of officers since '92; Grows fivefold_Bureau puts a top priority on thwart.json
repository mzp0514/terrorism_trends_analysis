Collingwood said analysts are assigned to all three, but most are in the investigative-support division.\n\"It's all part of our effort to play a larger role in the intelligence community in counterintelligence and counterterrorism activity, to identify, prevent and disrupt terrorists,\" Collingwood said.\nThe TRAC study said Justice Department records show that in 1998 there were 37 terrorism convictions and eight internal security convictions from FBI cases. There was no earlier Justice data on terrorism cases because the category was only recently employed, but national security convictions totaled seven each in 1992 and 1993, four in 1994, 12 in 1995 and eight each in 1996, 1997 and 1998.\nIn 1998, drug cases, bank robberies and bank fraud were still the three categories producing the most FBI convictions, accounting for 54 percent of the 12,730 that year.\n\"The low number of terrorism convictions is a good thing, not a bad thing,\" Collingwood said. \"We're now working with the CIA and foreign agencies to disrupt terrorists before they can carry out their actions and preferably before they get inside the United States. Figures on those actions aren't recorded, because they are secret.\"\nHe noted that the statistics can understate anti-terrorist efforts. \"We recently convicted a gang in the Pacific Northwest of bank robbery and their convictions will show up that way, but they were robbing banks to support their terrorist activities,\" Collingwood said.\nThe TRAC study itself said, \"The number of criminal prosecutions of spies and terrorists is not a very good index of FBI concerns, â€¦ because these kinds of cases frequently are not brought into open court.\"\nThe study found evidence that more time was being spent developing all kinds of cases, because the percentage of FBI cases that U.S. attorneys agreed to prosecute rose from 41 percent in 1992 to 49 percent in 1998. Also the conviction rate for defendants in all kinds of FBI cases improved from 67 percent in 1992 to 76 percent in 1998. Median prison sentences rose from 18 months to 25 months.\n\nLoad-Date: August 30, 2000"
