    "full text": "To the Editor:\nJames S. Mellett writes (letter, Aug. 18): ''More than 200,000 Iranian Jews are trapped in Iran.'' Before the overthrow of the Shah in 1979, the Jewish population numbered some 80,000.\nSince the rise of the Islamic republic, the majority have emigrated. Estimates of the Jewish population range from 22,000 (American Jewish Year Book, 1989) to more than 30,000, given by Iranian Jewish sources.\nWhile there are some restrictions on travel, several thousand Iranian Jews leave the country each year. I recently met in New York two young Iranian Jewish men, who had been issued passports to come to the United States after completing their army service. With the ending of the Iraq-Iran war, it is hoped that travel and emigration will be further eased. Iranian Jews are not ''trapped'' in the way the Jews of Yemen or Syria are.\nAs erroneous as Mr. Mellett's figures is his conclusion that because Israel is naturally concerned about the fate of Jews in Iran, Israeli foreign policy on Iran ''may be getting in the way of our foreign policy.'' Jerusalem and Washington agree that Iran is a strategically vital country, and it is in our common interest to encourage the more moderate, pragmatic elements in Iran, who are prepared to deal with the West, and to weaken the power of the radical Islamic elements, like the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, who aid militant Shiite groups in Lebanon, which have kidnapped and killed Americans and Jews.\nThe United States and Israel are both threatened by the same forces of fanaticism and extremism, who would benefit most from any widening rift between Washington and Jerusalem.\n \nGEORGE E. GRUEN\nDirector, Middle East Affairs\nAmerican Jewish Committee\n  New York, Aug. 18, 1989"
