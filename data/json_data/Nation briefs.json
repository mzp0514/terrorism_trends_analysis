Mohamud was accused of leading a plot to detonate a bomb at Portland's 2010 Christmas tree-lighting ceremony. \nBut the device he thought was a bomb was a fake, supplied by undercover FBI agents posing as members of al-Qaida. Mohamud faces up to life in prison at his sentencing. Prosecutors had argued that Mohamud was predisposed to terrorism as early as 15 years old. Authorities: Carjacker had $495,000 in pot SPARKS, Nev. - Authorities recovered more than 100 pounds of marijuana with a street value of nearly $500,000 from the SUV that was carrying four suspected drug traffickers from Florida before one fled a traffic stop on Interstate 80 in Nevada, stole a state trooper's cruiser and ultimately shot himself to death. A total of 109 pounds of pot was found wrapped in packages in the back of the 2013 Ford Explorer that a Nevada Highway Patrol trooper first pulled over five miles east of Reno at 3:55 p.m. Monday, NHP spokesman Chuck Allen said Thursday. He estimated the value at $495,000, based on a sale price of $10 per gram. Devin Peterson, a 22-year-old felon from Jacksonville on probation for carrying a concealed weapon, managed to steal a trooper's cruiser and use his shotgun to carjack another vehicle during a chase on I-80. The chase ended with Peterson shooting himself in the chest with the officer's weapon. DA says grand jury foreman was felon NASHVILLE, Tenn. - Nashville's top prosecutor said Thursday he is expecting a flood of appeals of criminal cases after it was discovered that a grand jury foreman was a felon and ineligible for jury service under state law. The Tennessee grand jury led by Eugene Grayer returned 919 indictments during its three-month term between July and September of 2011. Republicans hammer nominee Chuck Hagel WASHINGTON - Republican senators hammered former GOP Sen. Chuck Hagel at his confirmation hearing Thursday on issues ranging from Israel and Iran to his support for a group that advocates the elimination of nuclear weapons. But with most Democrats in his corner, an unflustered Hagel seems headed for approval as defense secretary. The Associated Press\n\nLoad-Date: February 1, 2013"
