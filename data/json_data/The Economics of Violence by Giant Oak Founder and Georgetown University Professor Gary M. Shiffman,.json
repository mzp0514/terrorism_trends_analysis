Shiffman's new book, The Economics of Violence: How Behavioral Science Can Transform Our View of Crime, Insurgency, and Terrorism, has been selected as a finalist for \"Best New Nonfiction Book\" and as a winner by the American Book Fest's 2020 International Book Awards in the category \"History: Military.\" The creator of the Machine Learning platform GOST速, Shiffman leverages his deep study in human behavior and organized violence and coercion to offer tools to promote peace and liberty.\nThe American Book Fest's Best Book Awards, now in its 17th year, represent one of the largest and most competitive mainstream book awards in the United States. Jeffrey Keen, president and CEO of American Book Fest, said, \"This year's contest yielded over 2,000 entries from authors and publishers around the world, which were then narrowed down to the final results.\"\n\"It is an honor to have The Economics of Violence recognized by the International Book Awards,\" said Shiffman. \"I wrote this book to empower those engaged in keeping us safe and free, and to inform the public on new approaches to enhancing public safety and security. I use case studies to make arguments articulating a new analysis of violence based on economics and using the terminology of markets.\"\nShiffman is a U.S. Navy Gulf War veteran, a former chief of staff for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and a former U.S. Senate National Security Advisor. He teaches at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. Screeners at financial institutions and government agencies use GOST to detect threats to public safety and security, including human and drug trafficking, money laundering, and terrorism.\nTo learn more about The Economics of Violence, click here.\nAbout Giant OakAt Giant Oak, we build trusted tools at the frontiers of behavioral science and artificial intelligence that enable you to make both rapid and informed decisions in an increasingly dynamic security environment.
