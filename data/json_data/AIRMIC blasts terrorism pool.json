    "full text": "The terrorism insurance pool set up by British insurers after they adopted a terrorism exclusion on all U.K.-based property ''will not work,'' says the Assn. of Insurance & Risk Managers in Industry & Commerce.\nThe pool -- reinsured by the British government -- covers damage to U.K.  property caused by terrorist acts.\nThe pool is funded by an additional premium paid by commercial policyholders to members of the Assn. of British Insurers (BI, Jan. 11).\nHowever, the pool was set up ''without meaningful consultation with either clients or with brokers,'' AIRMIC claims.\nAIRMIC Chairwoman Elizabeth Taylor told members at their annual conference last week that the pool is ''seriously underfunded,'' which concerns the Department of Trade and Industry. The DTI and ABI would not comment.\nThe pool is underfunded because many British risk managers do not want to pay the hefty terrorism premium and would rather self-insure the risk, contends Ms. Taylor, group risk manager of Harrisons & Crossfield P.L.C., an animal feed and timber company in Suffolk, England.\nIn a special meeting at last week's AIRMIC conference, members voiced their dissatisfaction with the pool. Some members say policyholders should operate the pool, not the ABI. Others believe that if insurers are charging such high premiums for property coverage, they should just include the risk as part of the coverage."
