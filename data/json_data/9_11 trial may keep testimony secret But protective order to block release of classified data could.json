The American Civil Liberties Union, which has filed a challenge to the protective order, says the restrictions will prevent the public from learning what happened to Mohammed and his co-defendants during several years of CIA confinement and interrogation.\nThe protective order requires the court to use a 40-second delay during court proceedings so that spectators, who watch behind sound-proof glass, can be prevented from hearing - from officials, lawyers or the defendants themselves - the still-classified details of the CIA's rendition and detention program.\n\"What we are challenging is the censorship of the defendant's testimony based on their personal knowledge of the government's torture and detention of them,\" said Hina Shamsi, an ACLU attorney who will be arguing against the protective order during the pretrial hearing at the U.S. base in Cuba. The protective order, which is also being challenged by a coalition of media organizations that includes The Associated Press, is overly broad because it would \"classify the defendants' own knowledge, thoughts and experience,\" Shamsi said.\n\"It's a truly extraordinary and chilling proposal that the government is asking the court to accept,\" she said.\nProtective orders are standard method in civilian and military trials to set rules for handling evidence for the prosecution and defense. Military prosecutors argue in court papers that the Sept. 11 trial requires additional security because the accused have personal knowledge of classified information such as interrogation techniques and knowledge about which other countries provided assistance in their capture.\nThe U.S. government has acknowledged that before the defendants were taken to Guantanamo in September 2006, they were subjected to \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" such as the simulated drowning method known as water-boarding. Defense attorneys say the treatment will be used to form the basis of their defense, but the proposed protective order limits their ability to make that case in court and in public advocacy on behalf of their clients.\n\"It's a way in which the government can hide what it did to these men during the period of detention by the CIA,\" said Army Capt. Jason Wright, a Pentagon-appointed attorney for Mohammed. \"I think we need to bring the truth to the light of day on these issues.\"\nThe judge's approval of the protective order, which may not happen this week, must occur before the Sept. 11 case can move forward. Defense lawyers cannot begin to review classified evidence against their clients until it is in place.\nThe protective order is the most contentious of about two dozen preliminary motions scheduled to be heard during a pretrial hearing expected to run through Friday. Other matters include whether the defendants can be required to attend court sessions, what clothing they are allowed to wear and defense requests for additional resources for what is considered one of the most significant terrorism prosecutions in U.S. history.\nMohammed and his four co-defendants were arraigned May 5 on charges that include terrorism, conspiracy and 2,976 counts of murder in violation of the law of war, one count for each known victim of the Sept. 11 attacks at the time the charges were filed. They could get the death penalty if convicted.\n\nLoad-Date: January 31, 2013"
