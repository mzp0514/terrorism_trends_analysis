The book covers Oregon's involvement in military conflicts ranging from the Spanish American War to Operation Enduring Freedom, and the United States' Global War on Terrorism.\nThe book also discusses the creation of the Oregon State Militia, which became the Oregon National Guard in 1887, and much more. Aney teamed with Alisha Hamel, a retired National Guard member who now lives in Western Oregon, to write the book, which contains many photos.\nAney's military background dates back to 1953 when he enlisted in Pendleton's Company G, 2nd Battalion, 186th Infantry Regiment. He graduated from what is now Oregon State University in 1958 with an Army ROTC Commission and served on active duty at Fort Benning, Georgia, and Fort Lewis, Washington.\nAney moved back to Oregon in 1963 and for about the next decade served in infantry units in Oregon City, Portland and Forest Grove, according to biographical information provided by Lou Gerber, an organizer of the reunion.\n___ (c)2018 The Observer (La Grande, Ore.)
