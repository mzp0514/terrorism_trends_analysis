    "full text": "WASHINGTON (AP) - Vice President Dick Cheney said Sunday the Pentagon and CIA are not violating people's rights by examining the banking and credit records of hundreds of Americans and others suspected of terrorism or espionage in the United States.\nRep. Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, the new chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said his panel will be the judge of that.\nNational security letters permit the executive branch to seek records about people in terrorism and spy investigations without a judge's approval or grand jury subpoena.\n\"The Defense Department gets involved because we've got hundreds of bases inside the United States that are potential terrorist targets,\" Cheney said.\n\"The Department of Defense has legitimate authority in this area. This is an authority that goes back three or four decades. It was reaffirmed in the Patriot Act,\" he said. \"It's perfectly legitimate activity. There's nothing wrong with it or illegal. It doesn't violate people's civil rights.\"\nIn a statement Sunday, Reyes promised that his panel would take a careful look at those claims.\n\"Any expansion by the department into intelligence collection, particularly on U.S. soil, is something our committee will thoroughly review,\" Reyes said.\n\nLoad-Date: January 15, 2007"
