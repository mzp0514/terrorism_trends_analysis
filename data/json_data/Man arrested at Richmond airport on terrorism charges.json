Mahmoud Amin Mohamed Elhassan, 25, who officials say drove Farrokh to Richmond, was also arrested on terrorism charges in Woodbridge.\nFarrokh, a U.S. citizen, had cleared the airport's TSA security checkpoint prior to being apprehended by FBI agents at his gate. Farrokh has been charged with attempting to provide material support and resources to a terrorist organization.\nElhassan, who is a legal U.S. resident from Jordan, has been charged as Farrokh accomplice. Both men reside in Woodbridge.\nFarrokh purchased a plane ticket on Dec. 21 from Richmond to Chicago, where he would then board a separate flight to Jordan and from there travel to Syria, according to an FBI special agent's affidavit in the DOJ's criminal complaint.\nElhassan introduced Farrokh to an FBI informant who he believed was a Jihadist and could advise Farrokh on how to join ISIS, according to the DOJ. In total, three FBI informants posed as Jihadist during the investigation.\nThe FBI informant who Elhassan introduced to Farrokh had previously agreed to become an informant for the FBI to reduce sentencing for a separate criminal charge, according to the complaint.\nFarrokh and Elhassan could face 20 years in prison if found guilty. An initial hearing is scheduled for Jan 19.\nThe FBI, DOJ and Airport Police declined to comment.\nShare this:\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)\n\nLoad-Date: January 25, 2016"
