    "full text": "A British court Wednesday extended the time nine suspects in the alleged plot to blow up U.S.-bound flights can be held without charges being filed against them, officials said.\nAnother suspect was expected to face a custody hearing today, while an 11th person was released without charge.\nPolice said eight suspects who have not been charged could be kept in custody until Aug. 30, giving police more time to quiz them about the plot they have said involved liquid-based explosives, while the ninth suspect had his detention extended until today.\nThe 11 were among about two dozen people arrested Aug. 10 in police raids in London, Birmingham and High Wycombe, about 30 miles northwest of the capital. The others arrested have either been charged or released.\nWednesday's court action represented the first time that police have used new anti-terrorism laws to hold suspects for more than 14 days without charge, Britain's Home Office said. The law lets officers make applications to hold terrorism suspects for a maximum of 28 days before filing charges.\nAmong those involved in the court action Wednesday was a suspect identified as Umair Hussain. His attorney, Timur Rustem, said Hussain was ordered held until Today by a high court judge. Rustem said the judge dismissed a request that he be held for a week.\n\"It is good to see the system works, where a High Court judge can in some cases grant the full seven days but at the same time use discretion where, for example, it's only a circumstantial case,\" he told reporters.\n\nLoad-Date: August 24, 2006"
