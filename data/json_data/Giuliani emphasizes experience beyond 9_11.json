    "full text": "CLIVE (AP) - Rudy Giuliani contested charges that he's a national security novice whose experience started and ended on Sept. 11, insisting Saturday that no other presidential candidate has a longer resume to deal with violence and terrorism.\nThe former New York mayor said he gets - and even takes - too much credit for reducing crime in his city. He also dismissed suggestions that his Republican presidential campaign is stalled.\n\"I think we are very relevant,\" he said. \"We are challenging in more states than anybody else.\"\nGiuliani's rare visit to Iowa came as he is struggling for attention and support in early voting states that matter now.\nFrom the start of his unconventional campaign, the moderate Republican has faced two questions: How does he connect with socially conservative voters? And how does he run on his management of the 9/11 attacks without looking exploitive?\nThe rise of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee in Iowa has complicated Giuliani's task on the first front. Now his GOP rivals are trying to undercut his terrorism-fighting image.\nSen. John McCain of Arizona, experiencing a late surge in the early voting state of New Hampshire, questioned whether Giuliani's performance after 9/11, which he always praises, translates into foreign policy experience.\n\nLoad-Date: December 30, 2007"
