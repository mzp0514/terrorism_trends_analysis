And the United States is still a \"target-rich environment,\" he added.\nHe said the nation has 102 nuclear plants with 68 on navigable waterways, approachable by boat.\nThe country has 200,000 private airplanes, any one of which could carry a bomb, he added. Even so, Larsen sees more reason for optimism than fear.\nConcerns should be kept in perspective, he said. Statistically, he believes the chance of being hurt by a drunken driver is far greater than being hurt by a terrorist.\n\nNotes\n\nReporter Robert Goodrich:; E-mail: rgoodrich@post-dispatch.com; Phone: 618-235-8919  \n\nLoad-Date: June 13, 2002"
