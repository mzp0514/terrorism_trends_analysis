    "full text": "Israel's chief delegate today assailed a Syrian proposal for a United Nations conference that would distinguish between terrorism and ''national liberation,'' saying it would make a ''laughingstock'' of the United Nations.\nThe delegate, Benjamin Netanyahu, accused Syria of proposing the conference as a Syrian attempt to justify several Syrian-backed terrorist plots uncovered last year.\n''To permit Libya, Syria and Iran to define terrorism is to invite the fox to guard over the chicken coop,'' Mr. Netanyahu told a General Assembly committee considering the proposal this week. ''If we have learned anything over the life of this body, it is that there must be a limit to excess, and no less important, a limit to farce.''\nSyria first proposed the conference last fall after Britain and other countries cut off ties with Syria after the arrest and conviction of a Syrian-backed operative in an attempt to place a bomb aboard an Israeli jet in London. The Syrians and other Arab countries have mounted a campaign to persuade the General Assembly to approve the idea for a conference and a committee that would lay the groundwork for the meeting in the Assembly's present session.\nThe conference idea has gained support from several Soviet-bloc diplomats in speeches before the Assembly committee considering the idea. Western diplomats have spoken out against the proposed conference in the debate.\nIn his speech to the Assembly committee Mr. Netanyahu, who has written a best-selling book on terrorism, said the conference would ''justify terrorism by placing it under the mantle of national liberation.''"
