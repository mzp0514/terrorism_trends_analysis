    "full text": "Watching  President Obama and former vice president Dick Cheney discuss, in separate speeches Thursday, the past, present and future tactics of intelligence gathering, national security  and enhanced interrogation techniques was truly breathtaking (\"Guantanamo plan takes more shots,\" News, Friday).\nObama  spoke in specifics about closing  the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the law regarding the capture and questioning of suspected terrorists, the ability to gather intelligence, and the obligation of this administration to protect the United States against another  terrorist attack.\nThen Cheney made his case that after Sept. 11, 2001,  another terrorist attack did not  take place on U.S. land during the Bush administration.  He also argued that enhanced interrogation techniques were necessary  for  terrorists  suspected of having information of impending attacks.\nAs an independent voter, I agree with  Obama and Cheney on certain national security issues. The bottom line:  We must be vigilant and must have every available legal remedy at our disposal to gather information and intelligence, and to take military and covert actions when justified.\nRich Unger\nSarasota, Fla.\nTorture hurts U.S. image\nI don't think some Americans care whether safeguarding the country requires torturing suspects. They don't realize that torture is illegal or that it increases the likelihood U.S. soldiers will be tortured (\"Put American lives first,\" Opposing view, Obama, Cheney speeches debate, Friday).\nThey don't understand that torture is simply not a good way to get information because they imagine  it as portrayed in the movies or  on TV shows such as 24. In reality, under physical torture people will lie and say anything to make the pain stop.  Interrogators collect a mountain of incorrect information that wastes time and resources on wild goose chases.\nTorture damages America's moral image and undermines our credibility. How can we portray the battle against terrorists as good vs. evil when we also use evil methods?\nCheney says that on 9/11 he was afraid, sitting in a White House bunker.  After 9/11 the whole country was afraid, and people who are afraid can do evil things. But an America that decides it needs to torture to defend itself is not America anymore.\nSamuel Curry\nPark Forest, Ill.\nVoice of opposition\nThe editorial \"A course correction, not a retreat, on fighting terrorism\"  supports using tactics that uphold U.S. values and says that is \"clearly the direction the nation voted for in November, when both Obama and GOP nominee John McCain campaigned on eliminating torture and closing Guantanamo\" (Our view).\nBut if both candidates advocated the same approach to these issues, where was the choice for the voters? Or did I simply miss the referendum: Do you favor closing Guantanamo?\nIf the majority of the voters had been against closing Guantanamo, how would they have expressed that opinion in the last election? A write-in vote for Dick Cheney?\nTom Lawrence\nTulsa \n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO, B/W, J. Scott Applewhite, AP\nPHOTO, B/W, Mark Wilson, Getty Images\n\nLoad-Date: May 27, 2009"
