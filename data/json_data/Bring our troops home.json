    "full text": "Is it perhaps time that the U.S. solves its own problems, before trying to solve the world's problems? We have our Army, Marines, naval and air forces, here and there. Trying to help peoples that are being ruled over by terrorist enemies.\nAt the same time, if news media is accurate, those peoples we are fighting for, often as not, do not support our efforts. In some cases, even supporting the enemy against us. Why is it our \"elected by the citizens\" government officials step back, and do little to help eliminate the terrorism that is growing in our own nation?\nWhy do they not \"act\", and bring all of our ground forces home. Leaving the naval and air forces to patrol, and when necessary retaliate. And, when our \"ground forces\" arrive back home, \"put them to work.\" Unite them with our our several law enforcement agencies, and \"attack\" our home grown enemies as well as foreign invaders. Put a complete end to home/foreign terrorism. All illegal drug manufacturers and distributors. An end to \"criminal gangs.\" Seriously. Motorcycle \"gangs,\" street \"gangs,\" and build the wall, and man it. An end to Mafia-type criminal activities.\nTake back our freedoms. And allow freedoms for those deserving of it. Make our court systems work. No more \"I refuse to answer ...!\" No more \"hiding truths of felonious crimes\" behind \"pyschiatric or religious\" barriers. Etc/etal!\nRay E. Daly, Lincoln\n\nLoad-Date: June 3, 2018"
