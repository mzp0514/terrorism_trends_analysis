    "full text": "Apr. 30--No doubt about it, times are changing and always will be.\nWe often hear the 21st century described as the \"age of information,\" but with rising gas costs, a heightened emphasis on sustainability and energy, widespread fear of global terrorism and an increasingly vehement call for environmental awareness, it would be hard to identify one issue that's most relevant to this and future generations.\nLast week, I asked you to comment on some of the pressing issues facing us today, and gave you some ideas to start: The economy, the environment, technology, religion and beliefs, poverty and wealth, entertainment and pop culture, worldwide terrorism, relations between dominant powers, education and energy needs\nThanks to all of you who responded here's what you had to say:\nIssue: Economy\n\"The fuel cost is unbelievably high. I own a diesel. The lowest price in (Brunswick) is 3.99.\"\n-- Rachel Taylor, Brunswick\nIssue: Media\n\"I thought I'd text you about the most important issue facing our world -- the media. The media constantly surrounds everyone with wrong ideas, such as (that) violence is OK which influences many people toward violence. For example, the third graders in Waycross probably got the idea to kill their teacher from movies or TV. This issue will only get worse with time, which is why I believe it is the most pressing.\"\n-- Brittany, eighth grade, St. Francis Xavier School\nIssue: Education\n\"I think that education problems are the most important because the way we are taught and what we learn affects the changes we make when we get older.\"\n-- Jennifer Fosnow, junior, Brunswick High School\n\"Education is without a doubt the greatest problem today. This is because a lack of good education is what has (contributed) to the faults in society today. The most comprehensive answer to the problems of not just one, but all of the mentioned topics, is improper education. Racial disputes, religious controversies, poverty, and (stretch) terrorism, all stem from lack of understanding and preparation, due to insufficient education. Schools patronize the ideas of understanding of all cultures and all circumstances through random policies such as \"No Child Left Behind,\" but political correctness and sporadic tutoring are not scapegoats when it comes to truly being progressive. The same things are taught over and over, and now with the inability to speak opinions regardless of political correctness, the classroom has been stifled, ultimately hindering learning.\"\n-- Alex Rumer,  junior, Brunswick High School\nIssue: Environment\n\"We need to stop being complacent and decrease our ecological footprints. Doing so will prevent the many negative consequences that are perpetuated by environmental degradation.\"\n-- Ali Perry, senior, Glynn Academy\nIssue: Religion and beliefs\n\"Religion and beliefs are one of the most critical issues facing our world today because people fail to realize that God is in control of everything. With God on your side, all the other issues you face will line up properly and according to His will. If people fail to place their faith in God, they begin to worry about the things of this world that are beyond their control. In order for our society to be healed, God says that His people must turn back to Him.\"\n-- Darby Chancey, junior, Brunswick High School\nTo see more of The Brunswick News or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.thebrunswicknews.com/.
