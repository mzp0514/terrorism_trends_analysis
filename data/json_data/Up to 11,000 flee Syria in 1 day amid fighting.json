    "full text": "BEIRUT - As many as 11,000 people fled Syria in 24 hours, some of them desperately clambering through a razor-wire fence into Turkey on Friday to escape fierce fighting between rebels and government forces for control of a border town.\nThe exodus is a sign of the escalating ferocity of the violence, which has killed more than 36,000 people since March 2011. Despite the bloodshed, embattled President Bashar Assad insisted there was no civil war in Syria, saying in a rare TV appearance that he was protecting Syrians against \"terrorism\" supported from abroad.\nThe flood of Syrians into neighboring Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon was \"the highest that we have had in quite some time,\" said Panos Moumtzis, the U.N. refugee agency's regional coordinator for the region.\nAbout 2,000 to 3,000 people are fleeing Syria daily, and the recent surge brings the number registered with the agency to more than 408,000, he said.\nDuring the 24-hour period that began Thursday, 9,000 Syrians crossed into Turkey - including 70 who were wounded and two who then died, U.N. officials said. Jordan and Lebanon each absorbed another 1,000 refugees.\nThe largest flow into Turkey came from the fighting at Ras al-Ayn in the predominantly Kurdish oil-producing northeastern province of al-Hasaka. The town hugs the border, practically adjacent to the Turkish town of Ceylanpinar.\n\nLoad-Date: November 10, 2012"
