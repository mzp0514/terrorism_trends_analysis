She indicated that in New Delhi, the capital where her trip continues Sunday, she would speak with government officials about how India can play a stronger role against terrorism.\nIn an event closed to reporters, Clinton met at the Taj with workers who survived the attacks. One was the hotel's general manager, Karambir Kang, who lost his wife and two children during the three-day siege.\nIn a memorial book, she wrote: \"Americans share a solidarity with this city and nation. Both our people have experienced the senseless and searing effects of violent extremism. And both can be grateful and proud of the heroism of brave men and women whose courage saved lives and prevented greater harm\" last November and on Sept. 11, 2001. \"Now it is up to all nations and people who seek peace and progress to work together. Let us rid the world of hatred and extremism that produces such nihilistic violence.\"\nOne of the most contentious issues between India and the U.S. is the administration's push for India to accept limits on carbon emissions as part of an international climate change agreement.\nClinton urged India to take a leading role and to avoid the missteps that occurred during U.S. industrialization.\n\"We acknowledge now with President Obama that we have made mistakes in the United States, and we along with other developed countries have contributed most significantly to the problem that we face with climate change,\" she said. \"We are hoping a great country like India will not make the same mistakes.\"\nObama said in a statement in Italy this month that the U.S. had \"sometimes fallen short\" of its responsibilities in controlling its carbon emissions.\nClinton also met with 11 business leaders, including Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, the largest privately held company in India. She told them she agreed that different countries ought to approach climate change in different ways. But she also said, \"There does have to be a framework that India and China in particular sign on to that produces results.\"\n \n\nGraphic\n\n \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, center, smiles as she interacts Saturday with members of Self Employed Women's Association, a nongovernment organization, in Mumbai, India.\n\nLoad-Date: July 20, 2009"
