Scheduling a Capitol Hill meeting today, both sides expected a swift accord in response to the bombing at the Olympics and the explosion of TWA 800.\n\"We need to move as quickly as we can,\" Clinton said. Said Gingrich, whose home state of Georgia is hosting the Olympics: \"This unites all Americans.\"\nThe tragedies emboldened Clinton's push to expand law enforcement's wiretap authority and study the safety of putting traceable markers - called \"taggants\" - in explosives.\nThe measures were dropped by Congress from an anti-terrorism bill Clinton signed April 24. Gingrich indicated Sunday his resistance was softening.\nSen. Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he might support the study, although he called taggants a red herring. Better would be making the FBI responsible for airport security, Hatch, R-Utah, said on PBS' \"Newshour with Jim Lehrer.\"\nClinton and the leaders agreed to hold partisan fire at least until this morning, when White House chief of staff Leon Panetta meets with lawmakers to seek an agreement.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO;\nPHOTO (1)\n1.
