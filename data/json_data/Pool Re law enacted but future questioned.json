    "full text": "The fate of Pool Re, the company set up to reinsure terrorism risks in the United Kingdom, hangs in the balance this week and may even fail to get off the ground.\nThe House of Lords last Thursday approved the Reinsurance (Acts of Terrorism) Bill, which activates the pool.\nHowever, before Pool Re begins operating, the government and the pool must sign a retrocession agreement that commits the government to pick up the tab if terrorism claims payments exceed the pool's funds (BI, May 17).\nAccording to the Assn. of British Insurers, which is negotiating on behalf of Pool Re, the government could jeopardize the deal because it is putting ''severe pressure'' on Pool Re to raise its rates in time for the next renewal season, which begins July 1. Pool Re began selling coverage for the January renewal season.\nThe ABI contends companies will refuse to buy the terrorism coverage if prices are raised.\nThe issue has come to a head because this Friday is the ''practical deadline'' for new coverage terms and conditions to be set before July renewals get under way, an ABI spokesman said. If the ABI refuses to raise the pool's rates the government can refuse to sign the retrocession agreement, thereby effectively killing the initiative."
