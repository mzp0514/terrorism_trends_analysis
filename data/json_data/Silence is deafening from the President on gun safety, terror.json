To the families of the victims, we are praying for you and we are here for you.\"\nThe bloodshed was the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil since 9/11 and the deadliest act of domestic violence under Trump's presidency. He took to Twitter before his address, writing, \"My warmest condolences and sympathies to the victims and families of the terrible Las Vegas shooting. God bless you!\"\nTrump, as a candidate and President, had made a habit of rushing to judgment about the motivations for killers in attacks domestically and abroad.\nAfter the recent mass shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., and Orlando, Trump openly speculated that the killers were radical Muslims hours before authorities confirmed that.\nHe tweeted hours after the Orlando shooting, \"Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!\"\nTrump has not made the same accusations against white suspects in other shootings, and pointedly would not refer to the slaying of Heather Heyer in Charlottesville, Va., as domestic terrorism.\nThis time, Trump made no overt mention of 64-year-old shooter Stephen Paddock, who fired at concertgoers with automatic weapons from his room in the nearby Mandalay Bay hotel and casino. Trump said only that Paddock had \"brutally murdered\" the victims. He did not describe it as an act of domestic terrorism.\nTrump's refusal to talk about terrorism drew immediate criticism.\n\"The lone wolf. The local shooter. The gunman. Any and everything, but terrorist. Wonder why,\" filmmaker and activist Ava DuVernay tweeted.\nTrump also made no statement about the trend of mass shootings in America. In his inaugural address, he had decried \"the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.\"\n\"This American carnage stops right here and stops right now,\" he said then.\nOn Monday, Trump thanked first responders who rushed to the scene and found Paddock dead inside his 32nd-floor room.\nHe also repeatedly invoked Scripture to comfort to victims.\n\"We ask God to help see you through this very dark period,\" he said.\n\"Scripture teaches us the Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit. We seek comfort in those words, for we know that God lives in the hearts of those who grieve. To the wounded who are now recovering in hospitals, we are praying for your full and speedy recovery, and pledge to you our support from this day forward.\"\nTrump said he will travel to Las Vegas on Wednesday, one day after he visits Puerto Rico to survey the deadly wreckage from Hurricane Maria.\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders later insisted it was too soon to discuss how the bloodbath might affect gun-control policy. The President and First Lady led a moment of silence in honor of the victims in the afternoon and ordered flags to be flown at half-staff for the rest of the week.\nTrump took in more than $30 million in NRA campaign contributions and has vowed to prevent any restrictions on the Second Amendment which protects the right of people to bear arms.\njsilverstein@nydailynews.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPresident Trump denounces \"act of pure evil\" (above) as flags near Washington Monument fly at half-staff (top r.).
