The sentence was meted out Thursday by Judge Edward J. Lodge in U.S. District Court in Boise.\nNow that the Idaho case has concluded, the Utah prosecution against Kurbanov is expected to move forward.\nProsecutors said Kurbanov ccc a Boise resident who was indicted on May 16, 2013, by federal grand juries in Utah and Idaho ccc communicated by email and Skype with the operator or operators of a website for the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, which is designated as a foreign terrorist organization.\nDuring these discussions, Kurbanov talked about his animosity toward Americans, particularly military members, according to evidence presented at his trial. In addition, he discussed his desire to build a bomb and possible targets in the United States, including military bases in Idaho and Texas.\nThe Utah indictment alleges that in January 2013, Kurbanov showed Internet videos, provided written recipes and conducted \"instructional shopping trips\" to show how to build improvised explosive devices to be used in bombings of public places.\nAccording to a Department of Justice news release, Kurbanov's activities were monitored by federal agents during the investigation and no terrorist attack occurred.\npmanson@sltrib.com\nTwitter: @PamelaMansonSLC\n\nLoad-Date: January 8, 2016"
