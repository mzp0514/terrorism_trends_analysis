    "full text": "ORANGE BEACH, Ala. - Homeland security measures may soon be tangling with good fishing in the Gulf of Mexico.\nAbout 4,000 offshore rigs dot the gulf, supplying about a third of the nation's domestic oil and gas supply.\nThe platforms are a vital link in the U.S. energy chain, yet they are virtually unprotected from terrorist attack.\nThe rigs also are a favorite destination for fishing boats.\nThe gulf doesn't have many reefs or undersea hills to attract fish. Rigs are the ultimate lure, providing cover for fish.\nBut the Coast Guard is writing new rules, due to be released in July, to plug what some see as a hole in America's homeland security plan.\nAnglers worry the changes might shut them out of prime territory.\nA fishing ban \"would hurt everybody,\" said Bobby Walker, skipper of the 60-foot Summer Breeze II, which regularly takes charter customers far out in the gulf to fish near rigs. \"There's a lot of boat traffic.\"\nRig security has never been a problem off the U.S. coast, and the Coast Guard doesn't intend to completely shut off access to the rigs, but \"there could be rules that change the way some people fish,\" said Coast Guard spokesman Jonathan McCool.\nThe Gulf Safety Committee, working with the energy industry, anglers and the Coast Guard, is formulating a plan for captains to voluntarily radio to rigs before approaching, said Maj. John Thomas Jenkins, in charge of saltwater fishing enforcement for Alabama Marine Resources Division.\n\nLoad-Date: May 23, 2003"
