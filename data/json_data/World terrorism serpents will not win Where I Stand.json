    "full text": "My wife and I were walking an Appalachian path a few months back when a poisonous copperhead snake struck at my wife. The snake was big. My wife was carrying pepper spray and amazingly with one quick move sprayed that deadly serpent. The snake was stunned as we lunged forward to safety. We were so very lucky. Either one of us could have died or lost a limb if that poisonous serpent had been successful. Journalists and cartoonists in a French newsroom were not so lucky last week. They were totally caught off guard by striking terrorists that ended their unsuspecting lives.\nThe attack on a Paris, France magazine killing 12 people is chilling. We must not allow such a heinous event to freeze us and keep us from practicing freedom and eliminating terrorism.\nChristians, Muslims, Jews, white people, black people, Americans, French and all must be freedom united.\nISIS, militant Islamists, Taliban and others are working to destroy our freedom of speech, religious freedom and equality. Sometimes we think we have problems in America. If we want to understand problems look at Syria and parts of Iraq or any other region that is ruled by militant religious extremism. Ten journalists and two police officers sacrificed their lives for freedom of speech in Paris.\nThe French magazine Charlie Hebdo was internationally known for its satirical cartoons that outraged many Muslims. Some of those militant Muslims retaliated by enacting a bloodbath.\nPeople across the planet must unite. Good people must stop fighting each other. We have problems in our country, and it could be a lot worse if we do not work together. We have no problems like what we could have if we lost our freedom.\nAmericans must be strong. We must practice our faith boldly. Speech and freedom to express ourselves must not get quieter but louder. Police officers and the military need our full support. They have tough jobs. We need them to be as effective as possible.\nOur job each day should be to do our part to keep our freedom. Treat each other kindly. Help each other. Practice the Golden Rule. Keep each other safe. Yet, unfortunately we have to live warily. Evil is a slithering serpent that might strike anyplace and anytime.\nBeing caught off guard could be fatal.\n\nLoad-Date: March 30, 2016"
