The administration is trying to thread a difficult needle: of taking a harder line on terrorism while also doing so within the confines of the criminal justice system.\nHolder and other administration officials said they would be engaging Congress on putting together a proposal for the changes to the law, which requires suspects to be told they have the right to remain silent and that their statements may be used against them in court. They did not provide specifics of possible changes.\nUnder the public safety exception, statements obtained pre-Miranda may be used in court — including to charge suspects — if it is determined that police needed to obtain information quickly to prevent further crimes. Once an immediate threat is ruled out, the Miranda warning must be read, under current law.\nThe public safety exception dates back to 1984, when the New York Police Department caught a man they believed was an armed rape suspect, only to discover that his loaded gun was missing from his holster. The Supreme Court ruled it was legal for the police to question the suspect before reading him his rights because the loaded gun — which he had tossed in a grocery store as he fled — was a threat to public safety and it was imperative it be found immediately.\nHolder referred to the case, New York vs. Quarles, in his remarks Sunday, saying it was time for the law to be updated.\n\"That's one of the things that I think we're going to be reaching out to Congress to do, to come up with a proposal that is both constitutional, but that is also relevant to our time and the threat that we now face,\" Holder said.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nEric Holder\n\nLoad-Date: May 10, 2010"
