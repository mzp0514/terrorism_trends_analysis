While not a traditional target of international terrorism, Beijing faces a growing long-term threat from Islamic separatists among the Uighur population in western China's Xinjiang region.\n\"This year poses a challenging test. We have scheduled massive training programs before the Olympics to better prepare against any possible threat,\" an officer from the General Staff Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army said, according to Xinhua.\nThe army will help Beijing's police and armed police with rescue operations if there is a terrorist attack at the games, Xinhua said.\nFBI head Robert Mueller said during a visit last month that China's security preparations for the Olympics were impressive and that his agency was lending its expertise on fending off possible terrorist attacks.\nChina's generally secretive police agencies have sought advice on Olympic security from the U.S., Germany, Israel and other foreign governments.\n\nLoad-Date: February 18, 2008"
