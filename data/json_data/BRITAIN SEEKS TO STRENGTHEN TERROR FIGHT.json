    "full text": "The British government yesterday announced a plan to overhaul its anti-terrorism laws, hoping to grant itself broad new powers to monitor and control foreign terrorism suspects without having to detain them indefinitely without charges -- a policy that was declared illegal last month by Britain's highest court.\n The measures, which must be put forward to Parliament as a bill, would give Home Secretary Charles Clarke the ability to give suspects curfews, tag them with electronic bracelets, limit their access to telephones and the Internet, restrict their communications with \"named individuals\" and, as a last resort, place them under house arrest.\nThe new \"control orders\" would apply to foreigners and British nationals, addressing the court's judgment that special treatment for foreign detainees was discriminatory and violated the European Convention on Human Rights. The orders, the government said, could be applied if there were \"reasonable grounds\" for suspecting terrorist activity. Prosecuting a suspect on charges would require a higher threshold.\n In announcing the plan to the House of Commons, Clarke said the suspects now in detention -- the number is thought to be between nine and 12 -- would remain in jail until the control orders were in place, adding that they continued \"to pose a threat to national security.\" Some of the men have been in detention for three years.\n The plan would revise the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act, passed shortly after the 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States.\n Separately, four British men who spent as much as three years in U.S. custody at the U.S. military's detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and then held by British police for a day were freed in London last night without charge.\n\nNotes\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nLoad-Date: January 27, 2005"
