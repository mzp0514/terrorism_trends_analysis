Other posts cite the Afghan Taliban and the Syria-based division of the Turkistan Islamic Party, according to SITE.\nMr. Alsahli’s last Facebook post, on Monday, states, “All the sins of a martyr are forgiven except debt,” SITE reported.\nThe shooting came three days after the Justice Department said that last year’s deadly shooting at a naval base in Pensacola, Fla., was linked to Al Qaeda. The gunman in that attack, Second Lt. Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, was a Saudi Air Force cadet who was training with the American military in Pensacola. \nF.B.I. Director Christopher A. Wray said on Monday that communications with Qaeda leaders found on Mr. Alshamrani’s phone showed that his attack on Naval Air Station Pensacola, which killed three sailors in December, was “the brutal culmination of years of planning and preparation.”\nEven though Mr. Alshamrani was thought to have operated alone, the government expelled 21 other Saudi students who were training with the American military, some of whom had links to extremist movements.\nMr. Alshamrani’s ability to train on the base with the U.S. military raises a host of thorny issues, including how the Defense Department screens potential recruits from Saudi Arabia. Attorney General William P. Barr said the screening and vetting process in Mr. Alshamrani’s case had been insufficient, and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper pledged in a statement to keep up additional safeguards that the Pentagon had already installed.\nAfter the shooting, the Defense Department ordered a stop to all international military student training at American installations. In January, Mr. Esper imposed tighter restrictions on the use of firearms and access to government facilities for international military students. He approved the continuous monitoring of international students while they are enrolled in U.S.-based training programs.\nNaval Air Station Corpus Christi has been home to naval pilot training since 1941, according to its website. It houses Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard and foreign student pilots.\nMs. Kieschnick, the base spokeswoman, said no Saudi nationals were training at the Corpus Christi installation. The only foreign trainees on base are two from the Netherlands and nine from Italy, she said.\nRudy Garza Jr., a City Council member in Corpus Christi, said the city manager had sent him and the rest of the Council a text informing them that the shooting was connected to terrorism.\n“We’ve been relatively secure at the base,” he said. “This gives us great concern. We have to be diligent that there are bad actors out there. We need to keep our guard up all time.”\nAdam Goldman contributed reporting.\nPHOTO: Naval Air Station Corpus Christi was placed “in a lockdown status,” the Texas base said on Thursday morning.
