A case in point is the harsh conditions in Peru's prisons (news article, Dec. 31).\nWhile the international community has hastened to support the Peruvian Government in this crisis, scant attention has been paid that this Government has sponsored torture, the disappearance of opposition activists and the arbitrary imprisonment of innocent people.\nThis Government has violated the human rights conventions to which it subscribes by placing civilians under the jurisdiction of the \"faceless judges\" of military courts, where basic legal rights do not exist.\nSince 1980, Amnesty International has reported systematic human rights violations in Peru. From 1983 to 1992, it documented 4,200 cases of forced disappearances. Thousands more have been killed in extrajudicial executions. These abuses have been replaced with a new pattern of abuse, in which thousands have been denied the right to a fair trial. The Peruvian Government granted a general amnesty in 1994 to members of the security forces who had been accused of committing human rights violations. The international community should take care to determine who the \"terrorists\" are.\n \nAIMEE SULLIVAN\nAustin, Tex., Dec. 31, 1996\n\nLoad-Date: January 1, 1997"
