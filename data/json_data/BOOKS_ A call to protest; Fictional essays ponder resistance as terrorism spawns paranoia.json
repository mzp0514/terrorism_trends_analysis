Knopf. $18. 163 pages.\nThe verdict: Subtle and powerful protest literature.\nEssayist, naturalist and fiction writer Barry Lopez presses his first two fields into powerful service of the third in \"Resistance,\" a dynamic and remarkable meditation on the nature and necessity of engagement. Written in the shadow of Sept. 11, its nine faux memoirs cover a variety of emotional and geographical terrain in their exploration of personal and political integrity. Written against the paranoia that accompanies terrorism and, at the very least, aspects of its mirror image, the Patriot Act, \"Resistance\" is a form of resistance itself. It is subtle and persuasive protest literature.\nFor the Journal-Constitution\nOne might argue that it is more comfortable to fictionalize about protest than to participate in marches or write letters to Congress. On the other hand, a book like \"Resistance\" reminds us how deeply protest resonates and suggests that it is up to each one of us to figure out how to formulate protest --- if, that is, one feels it's worth expressing. Lopez presents such issues beautifully.\nBy examining various professions, types and situations, Lopez makes us, too, inspect how we respond to a world that grows more challenging by the day. On one level, \"Resistance\" is a series of parables. But it's not at all wooden or formal, because it's also pure stories, informed by singular viewpoints, single narrators, a feeling of release and extraordinarily precise writing. Lopez is fiercely imaginative, intellectually rigorous and morally uncompromising. How stark his tales are is underlined by the austere, haunting images of artist Alan Magee that accompany each of them.\nLopez purposely keeps gender vague until partway into each story. He also avoids the trivial, the consumerist and the tawdry; even though this isn't grim, it's not the stuff of humor or satire. At the same time, while \"Resistance\" is deeply serious, it is never stiff, because Lopez's writing is as supple and taut as his mind. He imagines characters such as Elizabeth Wangfu, the scholar of \"The Walls at Yogpar,\" and Harvey Fleming, the crippled Vietnam veteran of \"Traveling With Bo Ling,\" with great detail and compassion. He also imbues landscape with vivid color, effectively transporting us to the grizzly bear territory of Montana, the murky ghetto of Bangalore and the exotic Autonomous Region of Xinjiang.\nWhat ties this together is the notion that all the characters know each other and seem to belong to an informal intellectual network. What one could call their mindshare is under attack: Prompting their alarm is a letter from the Office of Inland Security telling the narrator of \"Apocalypse,\" the first story, that his work as an independent curator has aroused the suspicion of the government.\n\"The letter's authors informed us of the nation's persisting need for democratic reform,\" Owen Daniels says. \"Each of us was told of widespread irritation with our work, and the government's desire to speak with us.\"\nThe missive prompts Daniels and his wife to leave Paris. \"We are not to be found now,\" he writes. \"We have unraveled ourselves from our residences, our situations. But like a bulb in a basement, suddenly somewhere we will turn on again in darkness.\"\nEven though Lopez never explicitly connects the characters, he makes clear all live in shadow, some of their own making, some by circumstance, some by government, class or economics. It doesn't really matter.\nWhat does is how they respond, how they drop out of a system they no longer believe in. By so dropping out, they engage --- as does Eric Rutterman, indigenous rights activist, when he leaves the Brazilian jungle. His story, \"Flight From Berlin,\" is among the most eloquent in this meticulous and chiseled book. What Rutterman says of the artist's need to be intuitive and decisive stands as a metaphor of engagement --- and protest:\n\"The 'object' to be drawn is not an object, in the sense that an artist is able to impose his scrutiny on it. The only way this will work --- the quick study that seems so exactly right, a rendering inexplicably beyond the artist's technical skill --- is if the artist is in conversation with the 'object.' Drawing by dialogue, you might call it. The artist engages the subject of the drawing as his equal and, through some shared faculty, it contributes.\"\nIn drawing such profound lines, \"Resistance\" makes explicit the connection between art and politics, suggesting it's high time they work together again.\nCarlo Wolff is a freelance writer in Cleveland.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPhoto: In a series of fictional memoirs, Barry Lopez examines how we react to an increasingly challenging world. / David Liittschwager\n\nLoad-Date: August 8, 2004"
