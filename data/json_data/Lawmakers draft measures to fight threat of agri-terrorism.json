    "full text": "Wisconsin lawmakers are drafting bills to make deliberately infecting animals with diseases illegal to head off agri-terrorism that could cripple the state's farming industry.\nLegislators began drafting the measures several weeks ago after a leader of the People for Ethical Treatment of Animals said he hoped foot-and-mouth disease would spread to American cattle, turning more people in vegetarians.\n\"PETA really exposed the vulnerability we have,\" said Assembly Agriculture Committee Chairman Al Ott. He and state Rep. Scott Walker, R-Wauwatosa, are drafting legislation to make it a crime to physically introduce a disease in animals. \"And I think we have to get folks to appreciate the kind of dangerous situation that exists.\"\nIowa, Indiana and Pennsylvania are considering similar laws.\nA radical group could easily plant or drop materials infected with highly contagious foot-and-mouth disease near one cow and see it spread to thousands of cattle, terrorist experts said.\nAn outbreak in Wisconsin livestock could devastate state farmers as meat prices plummet and thousands of animals are slaughtered. Millions of animals with foot-and-mouth disease were slaughtered in Britain this winter.\n\"The impact, if correctly executed, could be quite big,\" said Peter Chalk, a terrorism expert at the Rand Corp., a public-policy think group in Virginia.\n\nLoad-Date: June 5, 2001"
