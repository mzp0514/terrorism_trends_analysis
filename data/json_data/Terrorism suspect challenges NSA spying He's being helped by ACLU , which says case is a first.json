    "full text": "A terrorism suspect is challenging the constitutionality of the National Security Agency's warrantless surveillance program, saying in a court document filed Wednesday that spying by the federal government has gone too far.\nIn the motion filed in federal court in Denver with help from the American Civil Liberties Union, Jamshid Muhtorov also requested that prosecutors disclose more about how surveillance law was used in his case. Muhtorov denies the terrorism charges he faces.\nSurveillance under current law is exceptionally intrusive and it is conducted by executive officers who enjoy broad authority to decide whom to monitor, when and for how long, Muhtorov argues in his motion.\nThe statute that authorized the surveillance is unconstitutional, Muhtorov says, citing constitutional provisions against unreasonable search and seizure.\nThe ACLU called the filing the first of its kind.\nJustice Department spokesman Brian Fallon declined to comment.\nThe challenge had been expected since the Justice Department in October said it intended to use information gleaned from one of the NSA's warrantless surveillance programs against Muhtorov. It was the first time the department had made such a disclosure.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court so far has turned aside challenges to the law on the grounds that people who bring such lawsuits have no evidence they are being targeted.\nMuhtorov was accused in 2012 of providing material support to an Uzbek terrorist organization active in Afghanistan.\n\nLoad-Date: January 31, 2014"
