    "full text": "It was more than a bridge yesterday, it was a span of hope.\nOn a brilliant day in May, New Yorkers and tourists refused to let terrorist threats take away the exhilaration of crossing the Brooklyn Bridge.\nSo, over they came: lunchtime strollers, tourists with maps and cameras, joggers and bikers - each with a story to tell about why they were there.\nA family from Wales refused to \"let the terrorists win\"; a Brooklyn Heights writer insisted \"this is my city!\" and said she would not give up her thrice-a-week ritual. A jogger said he would be \"damned\" if he had to stop his daily run that once included a loop around the World Trade Center.\nAnd a Holocaust survivor now living in Kew Gardens, Queens, said he \"just wanted to see the boats.\"\nBefore terrorism struck New York, these outings would have been nothing more than springtime jaunts. Now they are viewed as simple acts of defiance.\nThey saw the bridge in all its glory yesterday, partaking of the stunning views and smelling the breeze dusted with a salt-water fragrance.\nBut many said they haven't been able to shake the image of the majestic bridge being used as an escape route for thousands of New Yorkers on Sept. 11, when the subways weren't running and people were forced to use the span to flee Manhattan.\nThat the bridge was now the subject of a terrorist threat made them more determined to be there.\n\"Oh forget it! This is my city,\" declared writer Tsurah Litzy, out for her three-times-a-week walking ritual that she refused to give up, even in the face of threats against the bridge and other city landmarks.\nAt a fast clip came Charles McCullagh, doing his daily jog, which once circled the twin towers. \"I'll be damned. This is not going to change my pattern,\" said McCullagh. \"They already ruined half my run.\"\n\"We're just here for a short time, and we can't afford not to go today,\" said Suzanne Dubois as she prepared to bike over the span with her daughter Melanie and son-in-law Eric.\nLife-long New Yorker Christopher Conway displayed his this-city-is-the-center-of-the-universe attitude as he walked to a law school class.\n\"What choice do I have? Where am I going to go?\" he asked. \"They don't have bagels anyplace else.\"\nDaniel Evans, 12, of Wales had to overcome a pang of fear when his family wanted to walk over the bridge. \"We can't let them take over our life, can we?\" said the boy, proud he had made the journey.\n\"If we hadn't walked the bridge,\" said Daniel, \"the terrorists would have won.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \nKRISTEN ARTZ SUNNY STROLL Tourists and New Yorkers alike don't let terror threat prevent them from crossing Brooklyn Bridge yesterday.\n\nLoad-Date: May 23, 2002"
