    "full text": "Warsaw, Poland Â» One of Russia's most wanted men -- a charismatic Chechen activist who counts Vanessa Redgrave among his supporters -- was arrested in Poland on Friday on Russian charges related to Chechnya's separatist war of the 1990s, then set free pending a decision on whether to extradite him.\nAkhmed Zakayev faces charges of murder, kidnapping and terrorism.\nZakayev, who was granted asylum in Britain years ago, maintains the accusations are trumped up and defiantly told Radio Free Europe the day before his arrest that he was in Poland \"absolutely legally\" and would not hide from authorities. The Kremlin casts the dapper activist as a dangerous guerrilla mastermind.\nThe 51-year-old was apprehended \"without any trouble\" as he left a home in Warsaw early in the day and turned over to prosecutors, national police spokesman Mariusz Sokolowski said.\nOn Friday evening a Warsaw regional court released Zakayev, who was in Warsaw to attend an international conference on Chechnya, pending a decision on whether to extradite him to Russia. Prosecutors had sought to extend his detention.\nConference organizer Adam Borowski said the court decision means Zakayev will stay in Poland until the court rules on his extradition.\nIt was unclear how long that might take. Prosecutors' spokeswoman Monika Lewandowska said prosecutors have not yet received a formal extradition request from Russia.
