Albrecht Medical Center. \nUnder the simulation, anthrax was released at a public event on Tuesday night. \nIt would take about three days for the Strategic National Stockpile to arrive in Pontiac, which would provide supplies for the hospital and health department to use when local supplies run out. \nThe arrival would spark a mass distribution of medicines. In the case of anthrax, it would be an antibiotic. \nMore than 80 people volunteered to be victims needing the preventive medicine. During the event, some acted confused and disobeyed orders while others had heart problems and collapsed. \nLinda Rhodes, health educator at the health department, said the simulation exceeded the departments expectations; they had hoped to process 400 people in the hour. \n\"We all need to be prepared for what might happen,\" said Rhodes. \"This will help us learn how to all work together with all the agencies, just in case.\" \n\nLoad-Date: March 31, 2006"
