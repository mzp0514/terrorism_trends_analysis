    "full text": "To the Editor:\nThe continuous sonic booms by United States SR-71 spy planes, causing panic among the population as they repeatedly break the sound barrier over Nicaraguan cities, must leave no doubt that the real intentions of the Reagan Administration are to terrorize the people of Nicaragua.\nPerhaps this is another example of how the Central Intelligence Agency forces that prepared the terrorist manual for the ''contras'' fighting the Sandinista Government work hand in hand with United States spy planes in a coordinated effort to overthrow the Government of Nicaragua.\nPerhaps this is an indication of how President Reagan intends to implement the foreign policy of his new electoral mandate.\nIf any other nation in the world were to engage in this sort of state-sponsored terrorism, the United States Government and people would be the first to scream bloody murder, and they would be justified. The standard, however, does not seem to apply to Nicaragua, where the United States Government is unleashing actions of this nature against a Government and a people that have threatened neither the United States nor any of its Central American neighbors.  The United States Government is in clear and criminal violation of Nicaragua's air space and of international law and common decency. State-sponsored terrorism must be denounced for what it is: cowardly action that has always been and will always be condemned.\n \nPASTOR VALLE-GARAY Consul General of Nicaragua Toronto, Nov. 12, 1984"
