    "full text": "BAGHDAD - A suicide bomber blew up his car Sunday outside government offices west of the Iraqi capital, killing 17 people, including women and elderly people waiting to collect welfare checks, officials said.\nSix police officers were among the dead in the latest strike on the provincial council compound in the Anbar province capital of Ramadi, police and hospital officials said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.\nAt least 23 people were wounded in Sunday's attack on the compound, which has been a favorite target for insurgents in the past.\n\"We rushed out of the office complex and saw many people injured and dead, lying on the street,\" said Anbar Deputy Gov. Saadoun Obeid, who was at his office when the explosion touched off a fire in the compound. \"I saw two women who were dead, their bodies burnt.\"\nObeid said a traffic jam kept the suicide bomber from driving his explosives-laden car to the front gate. Eyewitnesses said the vehicle exploded about 200 meters from the compound, creating a crater several meters wide.\nOfficials immediately blamed al-Qaida in Iraq for the attack in Anbar, a former stronghold of al-Qaida militants and Sunni insurgents that stretches just west of Baghdad to Iraq's borders with Syria, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.\nPolice found a second bomb in a nearby parking lot a few minutes later but said they safely disposed of it.\nAnother suicide bomber in Iraq's eastern Diyala province killed a Shiite pilgrim and his son as they headed to a religious parade.\n\nLoad-Date: December 13, 2010"
