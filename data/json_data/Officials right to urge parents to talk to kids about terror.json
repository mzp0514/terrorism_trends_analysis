    "full text": "Contrary to the suggestion of some child experts, the Department of Homeland Security is on target in urging parents to talk with their children about terrorism (\"Ads urge parents to talk terrorism: Some worry spots may frighten kids,\" News, Nov. 23).\nSchools nationwide conduct regular fire drills to protect students. Children do not stay home out of fear that their school will burn down because educators talk with them about fire safety and conduct evacuation drills.\nThe real issue is how we talk with children about the realities challenging our safety, not whether we talk with them.\nFear is best managed by education, communication and preparation -- not by sticking our heads in the sand. Age- and developmentally appropriate communications better prepare our children for the safety threats they may face in the future.\nWhile all adults should work to protect our children better, providing a false sense of security by denial and ignoring terrorism is as dangerous as overreaction.\nKenneth S. Trump\nPresident\nNational School Safety\nand Security Services\nCleveland\nMore harm than good\nI read with interest the article about the Homeland Security Department ads. I am the parent of four children, and I do see the need to have a plan in the event something happens.\nBut I agree with Ronald Stephens of the National School Safety Center that parents want children \"to grow up with a feeling of security and safety without feeling that the big, bad boogeyman is going to get them at any moment.\"\nAlthough TV stations are being encouraged to run the ads only during \"adult programming,\" kids could eventually hear or see them. Are these kids being exposed to a type of terrorism? If a child can read, how can he or she be protected from discovering a print ad?\nParents should take responsibility for teaching their kids about life's dangers. But I don't think anyone should \"use children to get to adults,\" as Marsha Evans, president of the American Red Cross, said of the ads.\nWith the understanding that terrorism is a method used to instill fear, confusion and pandemonium -- and considering the possibility of children hearing or seeing the ads -- I think they could cause more harm than benefit.\nE. Spear\nJacksonville, N.C.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO, B/W, Alex Wong, Getty Images; Encouraging readiness: Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge and Kathy Crosby of the Ad Council watch an ad this month urging parents to talk to their children about what to do if disaster strikes.\n\nLoad-Date: December 1, 2004"
