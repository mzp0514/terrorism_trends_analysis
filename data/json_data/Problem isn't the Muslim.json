I understand his talks focus on tolerance and diversity and that the majority of Muslims are peaceful.\nShibly is a controversial figure because he has at times criticized the American government for the way it pursues terrorism cases. His critics say his causes are often political and not religious.\nLast July, he wrote an opinion piece for the Trib. He wound up his article writing that \"terrorism is never justifiable and never an answer. Both those who twist Islamic text to justify such abhorrent actions and those who twist Islamic text to claim Islam supports such abhorrent actions are hijacking my faith.\"\nWhile all of that may be true, I'm not sure it only applies to a specific religion. The instructor probably could have come up with another speaker. I started thinking about some of the characters who have managed to find their way to the front of classrooms I've sat in during my public school student career.\nThere was one military officer who told war stories and then advocated we would be better off just launching a massive nuclear first strike against the Soviet Union. I remember one woman who came in and talked about reincarnation. It's been many moons, but I want to say she either was or at least hung around with Sacajawea.\nAnd of course, we had the American Dream, which once was explained to us by none other than the American Dream himself, wrestler Dusty Rhodes.\nSchool board member Candy Olson was right to suggest to the angry parents that they might back off a little on this one. This was an advanced high school class and not a lesson in bomb building.\nAlso, we might not have to worry quite as much about the ideas our children are exposed to if we exposed them to a few other seldom-discussed ideas, such as the basics of the American system of government.\nI'm talking about civics and the history of who and what we are all about. In recent years, those subjects we all studied have either disappeared or become electives.\nWe don't understand our own government or why things are. We don't know the history of our cities and states, even less about the political and social geographies that affect us.\nI think it's a good thing that parents are concerned about what happens in their children's classrooms. But I think I would be more concerned about what is not happening, and that is a never-ending civics lesson on what this country is all about.\nCopyright © 2012, The Tampa Tribune and may not be republished without permission.
