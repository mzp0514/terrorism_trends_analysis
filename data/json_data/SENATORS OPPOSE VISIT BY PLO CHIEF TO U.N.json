    "full text": "WASHINGTON - Sixty-eight senators sent a letter Monday to Secretary of State James A. Baker III strongly opposing a visa for Yasser Arafat to address the United Nations in New York this fall.  In their letter, the senators charged that Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, had failed to live up to the commitments that he made Dec. 14 to recognize Israel's right to exist and renounce terrorism.\nThey questioned the utility of the subsequent U.S.-PLO dialogue.  ''This is not the time for unearned concessions or rewards, such as reversing the current policy of denying a visa for Arafat to enter the United States, or elevating the PLO dialogue to higher levels,'' they said.  ''Rewarding the PLO at this time would undercut the peace process, call into question the seriousness of U.S. anti-terrorism policy, be antithetical to American interests and threaten the security of Israel.'' The letter was circulated by Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla.; Sen. Joseph I.  Lieberman, D-Conn.; and Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif.  It had gathered 68 signatures as of late Monday night, 17 more than a similar letter sent to former Secretary of State George P. Shultz last year opposing a visa for Arafat to address the United Nations in New York.  1989, The Washington Post\n\nLoad-Date: October 25, 1993"
