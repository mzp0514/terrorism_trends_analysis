Defendant Ahmad Ajaj appeared to smile in wonderment, then joined a chant of \"Allahu Akbar!\"- Arabic for \"God is great!\"\nSalameh, a 26-year-old Palestinian, was accused of helping bankroll the attack, building the bomb and renting the van that carried it into the trade center's underground parking garage.\nProsecutors said Ayyad, 26, a chemist, ordered chemicals for the bomb and later told news organizations the motive: to protest U.S. aid to Israel.\nWitnesses said Mahmud Abouhalima, 34, frequented the apartment where the bomb was built, while Ajaj, 28, provided bombmaking expertise. Ajaj was in jail on a false-passport conviction when the blast occurred.\nAjaj lived in Houston, the others in New Jersey suburbs of New York City.\nDefense attorneys contended that the government twisted the evidence to trap the defendants in a web of conspiracy.\nSalameh's lawyer, Robert Precht, said he will appeal. He called it a \"shameful day\" because of pretrial leaks designed to \"demonize\" his client.\n\"No one in the government should be patting themselves on the back and pretending this was a fair outcome,\" Precht said.\nHassen Abdellah, attorney for Abouhalima, said the verdict came too quickly after a five-month trial that included 207 prosecution witnesses, four defense witnesses and more than 1,000 exhibits.\nBut Abdellah added, \"I'm not going to second-guess the jury. We hope they did the best they could under the circumstances.\" He said he didn't know whether he would appeal.\nPrecht acknowledged in closing arguments that there was a conspiracy but insisted his client was an unwitting dupe of the alleged ringleader, Ramzi Yousef, a fugitive, and therefore was innocent.\nSalameh later complained to the judge about his attorney's comment.\nThe noontime blast Feb. 26, 1993, blew a five-story-deep crater in a garage beneath the trade center.\nThe 1,200 pounds of explosives inside a yellow Ryder van wrecked the skyscrapers' power and emergency systems. Tens of thousands of people fled down smoky, dark stairwells in a six-hour evacuation, emerging with soot on their faces and terror in their eyes.\nA pregnant woman was plucked off a rooftop by a police helicopter. Seventeen kindergartners spent five hours trapped in an elevator.\nAmong the six people killed were a pregnant clerical worker and a trade center worker whose body wasn't found for two weeks.\nTwo days after the blast, investigators found van parts in the rubble, one with a vehicle identification number. That led them to Salameh, who was arrested March 4 as he tried to recover a $ 400 deposit on the rental van.\nAlso charged with conspiracy in the bombing were Bilal Alkaisi, 28, who awaits trial, and fugitives Yousef, 26, and Abdul Yasin, 33.\nWhite said the government is investing \"considearble efforts\" to find the fugitives. She didn't elaborate.\nBOX:\nDEFENDANTS\nFollowing are profiles of the men who have been convicted, who have fugitive status and who are awaiting trial in the World Trade Center bombing.\n*Convicted:\n*Mohammad A.
