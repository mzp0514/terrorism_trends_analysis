    "full text": "\"Property: Stories Between Two Novellas\" (HarperCollins), by Lionel Shriver\nIf Lionel Shriver weren't such a terrific writer, she might have had a glorious career as a sociologist. In her latest book, \"Property,\" she explores a host of contemporary social issues, including freeloading young Americans abroad (\"Kilifi Creek\"), adult children who won't leave home (\"Domestic Terrorism\") and, in a story titled \"Negative Equity,\" the housing debt that forces some divorcing couples to stay together under the same roof because they can't afford to sell.\nThe common denominator of the 10 stories and two novellas is property, both the spaces we live in and the stuff that we fill them with, including art projects, such as the one at the center of \"The Standing Chandelier.\" It's the best of the bunch, investigating what happens when Jillian Frisk's best friend, longtime tennis partner Weston Babansky, aka Baba, decides to marry another woman, Paige Myer, and Paige lays down an ultimatum: Her or me.\nWith extraordinary precision and uncanny perceptiveness, Shriver charts the aftermath of Baba's proposal and Frisk's impulsive wedding gift of the artwork that lends the story its name. It's sad, sweet and funny, qualities sometimes missing in the other stories.\n\nLoad-Date: May 2, 2018"
