The police believe that Gundolf Kohler, a student who had participated in the neo-Nazi group's so-called field exercises, died in planting the bomb that killed 12 people. Ninety-nine victims of the attack, 10 of them in critical condition, remain in Munich hospitals.\nWhile the P.L.O.'s representitive in Bonn, Abdalla Frangi, rejected the ministry's statement, Franz Josef Strauss, the Bavarian Premier and Christian Democratic candidate for Chancellor, said in a newspaper interview that he had ''rather certain information'' that Mr. Hoffmann or other members of the organization, which was banned last January, had received money from the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.\nMr. Strauss has been attempting to make an election issue of the terrorist attack, saying that the federal Interior Minister, Gerhart Baum, has been weak in dealing with terrorism. Mr. Strauss pointed out today that Mr. Baum had visited the Libyan leader and ''agreed to closely cooperate in the struggle against terrorism.''"
