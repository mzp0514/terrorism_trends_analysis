The Japan Atomic Energy Commission has tackled this issue very seriously. In 1991 we established a ''no plutonium surplus policy'' -- and strengthened it in 2003 -- under which we ask Japanese electric utilities to publish a plutonium usage plan every year before they reprocess their spent fuel at Rokkasho.\nWe believe that spent fuel management is one of the most important issues for Japan's nuclear energy policy, which must take into account the ''Innovative Strategy for Energy and the Environment'' report of the Energy and the Environment Council, written after the Fukushima accident.\nDespite the fact that the government is now examining the role of the commission, including its abolition in accordance with this strategy, we hope the new Japanese government, after the general election on Dec. 16, will keep this ''no plutonium surplus policy'' or even make it stronger, given the increased concern over nuclear terrorism and tension in northeast Asia.\nSHUNSUKE KONDO Tokyo, Dec. 3, 2012\nThe writer, professor emeritus of nuclear engineering at the University of Tokyo, is chairman of the Japan Atomic Energy Commission.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/10/opinion/japans-plutonium-policy.html\n\nLoad-Date: December 10, 2012"
