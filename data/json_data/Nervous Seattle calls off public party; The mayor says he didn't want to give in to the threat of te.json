    "full text": "After planning for two years to stage one of the biggest New Year's Eve parties in the nation, Seattle officials Tuesday canceled their public celebration at the base of the city's best-known landmark, the Space Needle, citing security concerns.\nSeattle has been on edge ever since riots broke out at the World Trade Organization meetings here three weeks ago, and the arrest on Dec. 14 of an Algerian man, Ahmed Ressam, who was carrying enough explosives to blow up a building. Ressam, who was stopped at Port Angeles as he tried to enter Washington state by ferry, had booked a hotel room for one night near the Space Needle. Authorities have said they have no evidence that Ressam was planning to blow up the 605-foot spire.\n\"It's a combination of things,\" said Seattle Mayor Paul Schell, explaining his decision. \"No other city has had a bomb delivered to its doorstep, or the kind of anxiety we've had over the WTO meetings, plus Y2K concerns.\"\nMore than 50,000 people had been expected for the fireworks, concerts and arts shows Friday night at the Seattle Center. The annual fireworks show from the Space Needle will go on, but the public will be barred from the 75-acre public area around the Space Needle beginning at 6 p.m. on Friday.\n\"Although we are comfortable that Seattle is not a target, we cannot assure people that there is no risk,\" Schell said.\nContributing to the fears about security is a missing propane truck, stolen south of Seattle just before the trade meetings, city officials said. \"That truck is still out there somewhere,\" said Vivian Phillips, a spokeswoman for the mayor. \"It's one of the concerns.\"\nWhile other cities that plan to hold New Year's Eve celebrations are going ahead with their plans, the cancellation of a party that was billed as the biggest civic celebration in a generation indicates that perhaps the greatest concern over the year 2000 is not computer glitches, but a fear of terrorism.\nAsked whether Seattle's cancellation might embolden terrorists into intimidating other cities, Schell said: \"Obviously we took into account those who would say we would be giving in to terrorism. But I'm more concerned about the safety of our citizens.\"\nSchell has been under heavy criticism for failing to provide adequate security at the WTO meetings. Some demonstrators broke windows and looted stores, causing more than $ 2 million in damage. More than 600 people were arrested.\nThis time, the mayor said he wanted to leave very little to chance. \"We know there is funny stuff going on out there,\" he said. \"The millennium, by its nature, is going to bring out the kookier fringe.\"\nOfficials in New York, Chicago and Washington, which also are planning major New Year's Eve parties, were reluctant to criticize Seattle's move, and said they had no plans to change their celebrations. But, indirectly, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York indicated disapproval.\n\"I would urge people not to let the psychology of fear infect the way they act; otherwise we have let the terrorist win without anybody striking a blow,\" Giuliani said. \"No mayor, no governor, can offer anyone perfect security. Life involves a level of risk.\"\nNew York is expecting upward of 2 million people for the celebration in Times Square. More than 8,000 police officers will be on the streets, and city officials say they have taken extraordinary security precautions, including welding sewer manholes in the area.\n\"This is New York,\" Giuliani said. \"If you tried to cancel, probably instead of 2 million people showing up, 4 million people would show up.\"\nSome of the fears have been stoked by statements from former government-intelligence officials. Jim Kallstrom, the former FBI agent in charge of the investigation into the crash of TWA flight 800 off Long Island in July 1996, recently urged people not to show up at the Times Square event.\n\"If there is a terrorism strike, it will be in a large gathering,\" Kallstrom said.\nIn Washington, city and federal officials are proceeding with plans for the millennium celebration to be held at the Lincoln Memorial. The evening's festivities, hosted by singer and actor Will Smith, will culminate in a midnight fireworks display set off by President Clinton.\nThe FBI has assisted Washington officials throughout the planning for the New Year's Eve party, a spokeswoman for the mayor's office said. And members of the National Guard will supplement the 3,500 police officers patrolling the streets Friday night, said Kevin Morison, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Department.\nIn Chicago, guests invited from every country in the world have started to arrive for the city's millennial party, a dinner and a fireworks display at McCormick Place, a lakefront convention center.\n\"I can understand what they did in Seattle,\" said Lois Weisberg, an organizer of the party. \"It's too bad, because we have a combination of Y2K and terrorist threats making everyone cautious. It really casts a pall over everything.\"\nLas Vegas, which is expecting about 250,000 out-of-town visitors this weekend, has also stepped up security, although none of the major outdoor celebrations has been curtailed, city officials said.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO: color\n\nLoad-Date: December 30, 1999"
