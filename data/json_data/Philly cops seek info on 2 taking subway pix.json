He then indicated that he was deleting the pictures and left, Sullivan said.\nNo footage was taken of the man because the security cameras at the Lombard station were not working. \n\"We feel confident this is nothing to be alarmed about,\" Sullivan said, \"but we do implore people to call us when you see something unusual, and let us make the determination.\"\nInvestigators frequently respond to reports of people taking photos of trains and subways. \"Usually, they just turn out to be art students or train buffs,\" he said. \nSEPTA spokeswoman Jerri Williams said members of the public are allowed to photograph subway stops and other portions of the transportation line and regularly do. \nThese two people \"were brought to our attention, so we'd just be interested in talking to them and learning a bit more about what they were doing.\" \n\nLoad-Date: September 25, 2009"
