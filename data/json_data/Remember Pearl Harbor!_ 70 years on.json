    "full text": "Japan's sneak attack on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, was launched 70 years ago today, making this an especially fitting moment to honor Pearl Harbor's dead and survivors, and to review the costly lessons of Dec. 7, 1941. \nPearl Harbor now is nearly beyond living memory. Yet America's precious remaining veterans of that momentous battle deserve to know that their valor -- and their fallen comrades' sacrifice -- is still recalled and valued, and always will be. \nHow America came to be attacked by Japan continues to fascinate historians. That America was attacked reminds us all that we must always be prepared to defend our nation. \nMuch like Sept. 11, 2001, Pearl Harbor gave America no choice but to respond quickly and forcefully around the globe to defend its own existence and ensure liberty's continuation. Our nation's fundamental mission, so brilliantly fulfilled in World War II -- to preserve freedom's blessings for subsequent generations of Americans -- remains the same in the war against terrorism. \nToday's Americans can pay no finer tribute to the World War II generation galvanized by Pearl Harbor than to continue to fulfill that shared mission -- whoever liberty's enemies are and wherever they might be. \n\nLoad-Date: December 7, 2011"
