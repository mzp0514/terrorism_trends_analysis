Deputies found the vehicle and noted that Jordan had \"a strong smell of alcohol coming off his breath\" as well as a 12-pack of beer in his car and an open container in the driver's seat, according to a police affidavit.\nJordan failed his field sobriety tests and was arrested for investigation of DUI, the affidavit states. When he arrived at the Duchesne County Jail, \"he was saying that he has been around people who have been tested positive for (coronavirus) and he had the symptoms ... He then started coughing\" on three deputies, the affidavit states.\n\"Earl Jordan told me that now we all would have (coronavirus) and all of our families are going to die,\" according to the affidavit.\nWhile conducting a breath test, Jordan purposely blew into the faces of the deputies nearby, the affidavit states. When he actually completed the test, his blood alcohol level was measured at 0.243, or nearly five times the legal limit.\nEMAIL: preavy@deseretnews.com\n\nLoad-Date: August 30, 2020"
