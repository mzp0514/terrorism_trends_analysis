Many of the property insurance problems experienced in the post-Hurricane Katrina Gulf Coast are ``self-inflicted,'' as state insurance regulators have held rates artificially low, he said.\nThe private sector cannot compete against the government when rates are subsidized, he said. ``We think this is a problem that should be dealt with at the state level'' and state officials should bear in mind the implications of subsidization.\nRegarding possible federal insurance regulation, ``We very much believe in the state insurance system.'' Yet, ``we wish it were easier to sell from state to state,'' he said.\n``You can tell I'm punting,'' he added.\nAn earlier summit speaker, House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, D-Mass., declined to make a firm commitment for or against federal insurance regulation.\nRep. Frank said good arguments exist for uniformity, and having multiple state regulations can result in inefficiencies. But he stressed that any federal system to regulate insurers must contain significant consumer protections to be acceptable.\nRep. Frank said he would support a federal role in insurance regulation ``as long as they hit a pretty high level'' of what's already being done by the states in terms of consumer protection. That will be the context in which Congress will debate the idea of an optional federal charter for insurers, he said.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nArt Credit: Allan Hubbard, National Economic Council\nArt Credit: AP Photos\n\nLoad-Date: March 16, 2007"
