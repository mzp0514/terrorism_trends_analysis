    "full text": "NATIONAL\nAn article on Tuesday about combating domestic terrorism referred incorrectly to the attacks on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. The attack involved a single gunman, not multiple. \n  BUSINESS\n  An article on Tuesday about a 1996 law meant to protect young internet companies from liability misidentified the law that protects hate speech. It is the First Amendment, not Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The error was repeated in the headline.\n  ARTS\n  A picture caption with a critic's notebook on Tuesday about the Mostly Mozart Festival misidentified the composers who were included in the program conducted by Gianandrea Noseda. They were Beethoven and Schubert, not Beethoven and Brahms.\n  Errors are corrected during the press run whenever possible, so some errors noted here may not have appeared in all editions.\n  To contact the newsroom regarding correction requests, complaints or other comments about our coverage, please email nytnews@nytimes.com or call 1-844-NYT-NEWS (1-844-698-6397).\n  Comments on editorials may be emailed to letters@nytimes.com or faxed to (212) 556-3622.\n  For newspaper delivery questions: 1-800-NYTIMES (1-800-698-4637) or email customercare@nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: August 11, 2019"
