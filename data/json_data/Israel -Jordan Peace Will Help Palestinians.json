    "full text": "To the Editor:\nThe peace agreement signed this week between Jordan and Israel, despite Yasir Arafat's negative view of it, has a potential positive impact on the West Bank.\nUntil 1967 the West Bank was part of Jordan, and the majority of Jordanians today are of Palestinian origin. The establishment of peace will open the borders and make for frequent and easy travel between the West Bank and Jordan. The distance from Jericho, Mr. Arafat's seat of authority, to Amman is only 30 miles, about the same as from Jericho to either Nablus or Hebron, the two large cities in the West Bank.\nJordanian banks have long operated in the West Bank, and Jordanian money is used there. Jordanians will undoubtedly recognize major new business and commercial opportunities in the West Bank.\nThe strengthening of these relations is in Israel's interest. It will lend stability to the West Bank economy. It will help strengthen Palestinian leadership. Jobs in Jordan for Palestinians will provide an alternative to jobs in Israel.\nIt will also allow Israel to seal off the West Bank, permanently if necessary, to reduce terrorism without also creating excessive unemployment there. In essence, we can anticipate a more open border between the West Bank and Jordan than between the West Bank and Israel.\n \nARTHUR S. OBERMAYER\nWest Newton, Mass., Oct. 27, 1994\n\nLoad-Date: October 31, 1994"
