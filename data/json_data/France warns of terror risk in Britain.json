France's Foreign Ministry is warning French travelers of a high terrorism risk in Britain, asking them to be watchful in public transport and busy tourist areas across the English Channel. \nA message posted on the ministry's Web site late Tuesday said British authorities have warned that \"the level of terrorist threat is very high in the United Kingdom, and the risk of an attack is very likely.\" The ministry said France wanted to pass those concerns on to French citizens, many of whom live in Britain or travel there frequently. France has not issued any recent warnings for other countries in Europe, though officials have repeatedly insisted that the threat is high in France as well and have boosted security at busy tourist sites such as Notre Dame Cathedral and the Eiffel Tower in Paris. France and Britain are among many European countries that have stepped up terrorism alert vigilance recently. Germany, meanwhile, says it remains watchful but that there is no reason to be \"alarmist.\" Security officials have said terrorists may be plotting attacks in Europe with assault weapons on public places, similar to the deadly 2008 shooting spree in Mumbai, India. European officials have provided no details about specific targets. French Foreign Ministry spokesman Bernard Valero said there was close cooperation between European countries and the U.S. \"Second ... we don't want to alarm (people) too much, but also we want to keep a very high level of preparedness on this issue,\" he said. \n\nLoad-Date: October 7, 2010"
