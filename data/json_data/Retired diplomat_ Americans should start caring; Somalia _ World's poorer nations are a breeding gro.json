Prior to his speech, Bridges visited with students at Clarke College and East Dubuque High School.\nIn an interview with the Telegraph Herald, Bridges said he told the students to be careful in applying the word \"war\" to America's struggle against terrorists, particularly when nations such as Italy have learned to live with terrorism without succumbing to fear.\nBridges said there are no instantaneous solutions to the situation in Somalia, but there might be hope for its economic future in oil production and tourism, if the nation could become politically stable.\nTesting indicates there might be oil in rock formations extending under the Gulf of Aden from Yemen to northern parts of Somalia, Bridges said. And the coastline along the Indian Ocean is known for its beauty.\nBut in a nation where the average woman has seven children, they cannot hope to provide jobs for everyone without addressing the population boom, Bridges said.\nThe vast majority of Somalis share a common language, culture and the Muslim religion, but, \"Clan warfare is always a problem,\" Bridges said.\nHe admitted that people are right when they say terrible things can happen in Africa and it won't affect the United States very much.\n\"We can afford economically and strategically not to care,\" about Africa, Bridges said, but he added, \"Humanitarian reasons should count for something.\"\nThe Organisation (sic) for Economic Cooperation and Development recommends that affluent nations should be spending seven-tenths of 1 percent of their budgets on foreign aid, Bridges said. Currently, the United States spends about one-tenth of 1 percent.\nAmericans and their government in general don't pay enough attention to Africa or any developing nations, as evidenced by how little geography is taught in school and the lack of media coverage, he said\n\"There can be great amounts of suffering and if the press isn't there, nobody in Dubuque or Detroit is going to know much about it,\" Bridges said.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nMug - Peter Bridges\n\nLoad-Date: February 28, 2003"
