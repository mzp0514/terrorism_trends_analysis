    "full text": "Recent events have kept our attention turned, once again, toward Israel.\nI am writing to encourage support of Israel in the action against the Palestinian Authority.\n(Ariel) Sharon must be allowed to finish what he has begun with (Yasser) Arafat, or the terrorists will have won the upper hand.\nConsider the 1999 \"peace\" agreement.\nThe majority of Arafat's demands were met: He got his land, and he got legitimacy.\nYet the violence actually increased.\nOf all the Middle Eastern land, Israel consists of about 1 percent of it. A larger portion of the \"mandated\" land that the PA claims is actually in Jordan, yet there are not suicide bombers attacking Jordan.\nThis is not about land, or oil, or nation-building. It is about driving Israel out of the Middle East and about using terror to reach that objective.\nIf suicide bombers and other forms of terror will succeed in making Sharon back down, it certainly will succeed here in the United States. Consider how vulnerable our nation felt following 9-11.\nWe must send the message to the terrorist world that their methods will not be tolerated: They will be dealt with swiftly and harshly. Do we want to live in fear of being in public places due to threat of suicide bombers, as those in Israel do?\nI agree that the current action is disturbing; war always is. However, Israel has not been the one sending suicide bombers into civilian areas.\nIsrael has acted appropriately and against the proper target.\nLet's support this nation as it stands against the enemy of terrorism.\nLori Miller\nNormal\n\nLoad-Date: April 12, 2002"
