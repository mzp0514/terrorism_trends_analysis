    "full text": "Amid constant scrutiny and misinformation regarding the ongoing refugee crisis, terrorism and its assumed connection to the religion of Islam, the Multicultural Awareness and Diversity Education Committee is looking to bring light to Islam and the issues surrounding it.\nThe organization is holding a special lecture called \"Understanding Islam,\" hosted by James LeSueur of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. LeSueur is a history professor who specializes in world history and is known to do seminars based on his work on the clashing and de-clashing of civilizations.\nKauffman Residential Center Residence Director Pankaj Desai was inspired to hold the lecture to inform the public about the ongoing refugee crisis, global terrorism and its effect on the Muslim community.\n\"People are misplaced and are suffering in so many ways,\" Desai said. \"With all of that happening, I asked how all of that is related to Islam and the idea of terrorism. All of these issues taking place today have one base: global terrorism, and Muslims are the ones suffering the most from this atrocity.\"\nThe least we can do is be informed, he said.\n\"I'm sure that many people could do with a little more education about Islam, and how it affects us. It impacts our own lives as community members. What can we do to be a part of the solution and not the problem?\"\nThe lecture will be held April 12 at 7 p.m. in the University Suites Multipurpose Room.\nnews@dailynebraskan.com\n\nLoad-Date: January 17, 2018"
