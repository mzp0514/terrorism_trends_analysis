    "full text": "The Clinton Administration has come to two major conclusions about terrorism in America, and from America.\nThe first is that the United States is becoming a national safe haven for terrorists from the Middle East: a combination bank, fund-raiser, militarist training ground, recruitment center, political academy and embarkation dock.\nSecond conclusion: Do something. So one recent night, instructions from Washington went out to banks nationwide to freeze the funds of the various Hamas, Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad units, and their clones, operating from the East Coast to Texas and California. Mr. Clinton did that by Presidential order.\nNow the Administration is asking Congress to pass new anti-terrorist legislation. It would enable the Government to trace funds to and from the terrorist-supporting groups, tighten the definition of terrorism, enlarge the powers of Federal attorneys to deal with it and make it illegal to plan or train for terrorism abroad as well as in the U.S.\nThe draft legislation is called the Omnibus Counterterrorism Act of 1995. It was drawn up by the Department of Justice on Presidential order and will be introduced in Congress in a matter of days.\nFor Americans who have been warning about terrorism operating in and out of America, the time to relax has hardly arrived. We will see how effective it is in ending the contribution to terrorism of American laws and American inattention.\nBut the fact is that the Clinton Administration has begun to pay more attention to the growth of terrorist organizations here than its predecessors have. And in parts of the government intelligence machinery, the assessment of the danger of terrorism originating in America is strong enough to surprise even anti-terrorism alarm ringers like myself.\nIn large part, the awakening can be credited to the terrorists themselves. Even for America, blowing up the World Trade Center was a little thick.\nBut the next time you get all worked up about the dastardly press, do remember that in the matter of terrorism, as so many others, it was an American journalist whose skill, determination and risk-taking (physical and professional) helped shake government awake.\nOn Nov. 21, 1994, PBS presented \"Jihad in America.\" The documentary laid it all out on film -- the meetings in American cities where the cry of holy war went up against America; Christians, Jews and Muslims who would not surrender to fundamentalism; the training; the visits to American units by Middle Eastern leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and the fund-raising structure that supported terrorism.\nThe executive producer was Steven Emerson, an investigator of terrorism who has turned out a strong body of work in film, books and print journalism. Among government officials I talked to, credit for Mr. Emerson was not only acknowledged but volunteered.\nDemocracy often has a tough time defending itself because it has to operate step by step, inch by inch, under the law. Yes, of course, that is democracy's blessing and strength.\nBut nothing says a democracy has to watch the bombers come racing in their trucks and pretend they are bicyclists out for a ride in the park. Laurie Mylroie, the U.S. expert on Iraq who wrote a fine best seller on Saddam Hussein with Judith Miller, has written another book, focusing on the question of an Iraqi role in the bombing. It deserves to be published wide and soon.\nThe Emerson documentary brought protests from American Muslim groups. So will the new legislation. Immediately, non-Muslims nod sypathetically and think, well, it's understandable Muslims will be upset. I almost did myself.\nBut why? Christians are not expected to complain about denunciation of Christian Fascists. Jews around the world led the protests of the massacre at the mosque in Hebron and Jews generally did not protest the President's freezing of funds of two extremist Jewish groups.\nThe assumption that all Muslims must be angry at action against Muslim terrorists strengthens the killers. It demeans the intelligence of all Muslims. And, as for the hundreds of thousands of Muslim victims who died under Muslim state tyranny or Muslim state-supported terrorism, it spits on their graves.\n\nLoad-Date: February 3, 1995"
