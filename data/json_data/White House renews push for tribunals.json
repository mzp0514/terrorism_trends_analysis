    "full text": "WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration on Wednesday continued to push for a military tribunal system for foreign terrorism suspects that would bar them from access to classified evidence.\nAttorney General Alberto Gonzales, testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, also recommended that proposed legislation to create a tribunal system allow hearsay evidence and testimony obtained through coercion.\nGonzales said it also should limit defendants' rights to confront their accusers.\nHis comments indicated that the White House is pressing ahead with plans for a tribunal system in which defendants' rights would be significantly restricted, despite a recent Supreme Court ruling that criticized the plan to withhold some evidence from defendants.\nIn the ruling, the court struck down President Bush's plan for tribunals, saying he had exceeded his authority by establishing the trial system in 2001 without Congress' approval.\nNow, the administration is asking Congress to endorse the harsh prosecution tactics the White House says are needed to try foreign terrorism suspects.\n\"In the midst of the current conflict, we must not share with captured terrorists the highly sensitive intelligence that may be relevant to military commission proceedings,\" Gonzales told the panel.\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he would \"have a hard time\" with legislation that would deny a defendant's access to crucial evidence.\n\"If the only way we can try a terrorist is to disclose classified evidence ... I would argue that we don't do the trial,\" he said.\n\nLoad-Date: August 3, 2006"
