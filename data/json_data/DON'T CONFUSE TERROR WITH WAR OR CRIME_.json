    "full text": "Editor, Times-Dispatch:/\nIn \"First - at Last,\" Todd Culbertson correctly asserts the primacy of terrorism as an issue in 2004, but he errs in writing of terrorism in terms of war.\nSince 9/11, politicians and editorial writers across the spectrum have used the familiar vocabulary of warfare to discuss terrorism.\nIn doing so, they have brought more heat than light to a complex new challenge that - while military in some aspects - little resembles the ancient business of state warfare.\nTerrorism is not best understood as war. Our terrorist adversaries are ideologues with nothing to lose - no homeland we can bombard or conquer, no population we can propagandize or punish. Even President Bush, in a recent moment of candor, admitted that the \"war on terrorism\" probably cannot be won.\nIt cannot be won because it is not war.\nSome suggest that terrorism be analyzed in terms of crime, which is also misleading. The criminal-justice model envisions the punishment of a misdeed after the fact. The idea of waiting for an act of terrorism to occur in order to punish its perpetrators - should any survive - is simply intolerable.\nFor 30 years, Americans have argued endlessly and unprofitably about the issue of abortion, with each side insisting that a fetus is something it is not - a human being, or mere tissue. To insist that terrorism should be understood as either war or crime would be equally unprofitable - and far more costly.\nTerrorism is terrorism. It demands its own vocabulary and analytical framework./ /\n\nLoad-Date: September 12, 2004"
