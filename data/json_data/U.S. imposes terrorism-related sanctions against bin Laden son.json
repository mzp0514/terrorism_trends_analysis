    "full text": "WASHINGTON — The Obama administration imposed sanctions Thursday on a son of Sept. 11 mastermind Osama bin Laden, saying the younger bin Laden poses a risk to U.S. national security.\nThe State Department said Hamza bin Laden has been added to its Specially Designated Global Terrorist list after he was \"determined to have committed, or pose a serious risk of committing, acts of terrorism that threaten the security of U.S. nationals or the national security.\"\nHamza bin Laden was officially named an al-Qaida member in 2014 by his father's successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri.\nThe State Department says the younger Laden — in a 2015 audio message — called for acts of terrorism in Western capitals. In an audio message last year, he threatened revenge against the U.S. and warned Americans they would be targeted at home and abroad.\nHamza bin Laden also has called for lone wolf, or solo-operative, attacks against U.S., French, and Israeli interests in Washington, Paris and Tel Aviv.\n\"Hamza bin Laden is actively engaged in terrorism,\" the State Department said, adding that terrorism designations deny individuals access to the U.S. financial system and \"can assist or complement the law enforcement actions of other U.S. agencies and other governments.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \nAssociated Press/Al-Jazeera In this image made from video broadcast by the Qatari-based satellite television station Al-Jazeera in November 2001, a young boy, left, identified as Hamza bin Laden, holds what the Taliban say is a piece of U.S. helicopter wreckage in Ghazni, Afghanistan.\n\nLoad-Date: January 6, 2017"
