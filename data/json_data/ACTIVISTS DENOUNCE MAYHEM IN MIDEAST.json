A ground offensive began yesterday.\n\"We need to stop this massacre against humanity,\" said Fatima Elkettani, 42, a Moroccan-born sales manager from Queens.\nAcross Seventh Ave., John Walland, 33, joined about 50 supporters of Israel, waving flags and chanting \"U.S.A.!\"\n\"I thought it was important to stand up to Hamas and terrorism, whether it's Islamic terrorism in Mumbai, London or Gaza,\" Walland said as he hoisted an Israeli flag in the air. \"Terrorism is terrorism.\"\nBruce Ticker, 58, agreed.\n\"This is a chapter in the war for survival,\" said Ticker, who drove to the city from Philadelphia yesterday. \"Hamas is building a war machine, and Israel has the right to counter that.\"\nrschapiro@nydailynews.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \nAnti-Israel demonstrators fill 42nd St. and marched from Times Square to the Israeli Consulate at Second Ave. and 42nd St. Photo by Ron Antonelli/Daily News\n\nLoad-Date: January 4, 2009"
