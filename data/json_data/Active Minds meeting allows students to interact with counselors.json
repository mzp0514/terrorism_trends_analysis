Students had the chance to come in and discuss their mental health concerns with counselors. This activity helped improve the moods of students struggling with depression or discomfort.\nActive Minds posted a flyer reading, \"Join us to build awareness and to change the conversation about mental health,\" welcoming all who wanted to take a breather and communicate issues with mental health professionals.\nStudents lined up to grab some food and make friends with caring individuals.
