    "full text": "Hundreds of emergency workers converged on Lower Manhattan early yesterday during a terrorism drill involving two mock explosions at a subway station.\nStreets around the Bowling Green subway station were shut down as police officers, firefighters, and medical workers rushed to rescue trapped passengers (played by volunteers) and to sift through simulated carnage (40 dead and 170 injured).\nThe four-hour drill, staged near ground zero, involved two trains. It was designed to test communications between emergency workers.\nMayor Bloomberg said the exercise, called \"Operation Transit Safe,\" was prompted partly by the recent terrorist bombings of trains in Madrid, Spain. It was the sixth exercise of its kind held by the city and the Department of Homeland Security since 2002.\n\"These things are invaluable,\" Mr. Bloomberg said. \"We have to make sure that we can get the right people and the right equipment to the right place, and that they can work together and communicate together.\"\nThe mayor said that emergency personnel communicated effectively as they removed the injured and guided passengers out of the station.\nHe said the city will keep holding realistic drills in order to train workers to \"think on their feet and do what's right.\"\n\"We learned a lot,\" he said. \"The public has the right to get the best protection we can possibly provide.\"\nThe drill came amid calls yesterday by two members of Congress for requiring the Homeland Security department to fix communication problems experienced by the city's fire department.\nReps. Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat of New York, and Christopher Shays, a Republican of Connecticut, said that a new bill addresses problems highlighted during major emergencies, including the September 11 attacks, in places like subways and high-rise buildings.\n\"Right when they need it most, during the largest and most challenging emergencies, communications systems are failing New York's firefighters and putting lives at risk,\" Ms. Maloney said in a written statement. \"We hope a new system for New York City could become a model for all high-threat cities and fire departments across the country.\"\nThe commissioner of the Office of Emergency Management, Joseph Bruno, said that yesterday's exercise had tested a new communication system that links the police and fire departments and other agencies.\n\"It worked very well,\" Mr. Bruno said. He said his agency now would review \"line by line\" what it had learned from the drill and what changes may need to be made.\nPolice Commissioner Raymond Kelly said the drill posed special challenges because it took place in a confined space and because power to the electrified subway tracks had to be shut off. Mr. Kelly said the police and fire departments had worked together smoothly.\n\"We'll do a lot more of these,\" he said. \"We're cognizant of the fact that we have to continue to work together and practice together.\"\nEmergency personnel interrupted the exercise when they found a suspicious package in the station. Mr. Bloomberg said that the package, which was examined by the bomb squad, proved harmless and apparently contained clothes.\n\nLoad-Date: May 17, 2004"
