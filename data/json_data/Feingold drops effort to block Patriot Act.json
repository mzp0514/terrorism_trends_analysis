    "full text": "With few if any allies, Sen. Russell Feingold dropped his effort late Wednesday to block the USA Patriot Act, clearing a path for Senate debate. \nBut he promised to try to add new protections for civil liberties during proceedings later this month.\n\"I have no desire to inconvenience my colleagues or force votes in the middle of the night,\" Feingold, D-Wis., said in a brief statement on the Senate floor.\nFeingold stuck to his objections, saying protracted talks with the White House over the law's protections for civil liberties produced only a \"fig leaf\" to cover weaknesses that leave people vulnerable to government intrusion.\n\"What we are seeing is quite simply a capitulation to the intransigent and misleading rhetoric of a White House that sees any effort to protect civil liberties as a sign of weakness,\" Feingold said during a floor speech Wednesday.\nFeingold did not say what his amendments would propose as Congress raced to renew the act's 16 provisions set to expire March 10. But any attempt to change the legislation would face an uphill battle, according to Majority Leader Bill Frist.\n\"The outcome here is absolutely predetermined,\" the Tennessee Republican said, expressing frustration with the delay. \"It's going to pass with overwhelming support.\"\nWhile the filibuster was a lone endeavor, Feingold had plenty of company in wanting the 2001 terrorism law to contain more curbs on the government's power to investigate people.\nCorrection\n\n\nHeadline: Feingold drops effort to block Patriot\nPublished: 02-16-2006\n* In a story on Page 5D Thursday, The Associated Press reported erroneously that Sen. \nRussell Feingold, D-Wis., had dropped his effort to block the Senate from renewing the Patriot Act. Feingold agreed Wednesday night only to postpone a Senate vote on overriding his objection to considering a bill for renewing the anti-terrorism law.\nCorrection-Date: February 17, 2006\n\nLoad-Date: February 16, 2006"
