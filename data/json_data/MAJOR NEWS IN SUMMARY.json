But last week, he seemed unusually gloomy.\nIn an interview with The New York Times that set alarm bells ringing in Washington, the King disparaged the Administration's mediation efforts. ''I now realize that principles mean nothing to the United States,'' he contended. ''Short-term issues, especially in election years, prevail.'' Accusing the United States of ''succumbing to the dictates of Israel,'' he insisted there was ''no way by which anyone should imagine it would be possible for Arabs to sit down and talk with Israel'' at present.\nThe Administration was dismayed. President Reagan had just surprised a Jewish charity audience by urging support for supplying Jordan with 1,600 Stinger missiles, a sale Israel strongly opposes. With dozens of members of Congress also against the deal, the King's appraisal ''surely makes it a lot more difficult,'' said Robert C. McFarlane, the White House national security adviser. State Department spokesman John Hughes said Arabs and Israelis ''must know there is no possibility of progress toward peace in the absence of negotiation.'' He added, ''The forces of extremism and terrorism are complicating the situation in the region, increasing the risks to moderates who contemplate joining the peace process.''\nAmerican officials said the King was also upset when the President last week rejected his requests for support for renewed United Nations condemnation of Israeli settlements on the West Bank, and for pressure on Israel to allow West Bank residents a role in the Palestine Liberation Organization's parliamentary body."
