    "full text": "An Atlanta accountant and his two friends spent hours watching Osama bin Laden training videos and practicing jihad attack moves with paintball guns in the woods in North Georgia, he testified Tuesday.\nWhen the practices turned into plans of moving to the Middle East and linking up with terrorist groups, the accountant backed out. But his friends continued with the plans up until they were captured by the FBI, Omer Kamal told a federal jury Tuesday.\nKamal's buddy, 23-year-old Ehsanul Islam Sadequee, is on trial on charges of conspiring to help overseas terrorists launch a violent jihad. His other friend, former Georgia Tech student Syed Haris Ahmed, was convicted in June of conspiring to help terrorists.\nKamal, who cooperated with the FBI and agreed to testify against his friend, said he got scared he was under surveillance and backed out of the terrorist plans.\nThey were \"contemplating going to any theater of combat to participate in violent jihad,\" Kamal told a jury Tuesday in U.S. District Court.\nSadequee, who is representing himself, said during his opening statement Tuesday that he talked about jihad \"fantasies\" but never had an actual plan of violence.\n\"There was no plan. There was a lot of talk about doing a lot of things,\" he told the jury. \"A lot of just empty talk.\"\nProsecutors say Sadequee didn't need to actually launch an attack. Just orchestrating it is a crime.\n\"The law allows the government to stop the plan before someone enrolls in flight school and learns to fly a jet,\" Assistant U.S. District Attorney Robert McBurney said.\nSadequee has denied that he conspired with known terrorists --- including one arrested with 40 pounds of explosives. Prosecutors said he supplied videos of Washington landmarks to overseas terrorists. On Tuesday, Sadequee spent more than an hour cross-examining his friend Kamal.\nAhmed, who is awaiting sentencing, agreed Tuesday to testify against Sadequee, as long as he could have time for prayer. He will take the stand today.\nTuesday's proceedings were also filled with prayers from Sadequee and his mother, who sat in the audience, silently weeping and repeating prayers.\nDressed in khaki-colored scrubs, a beard and long, unkempt hair, Sadequee nervously defended his actions to the jury. He said he only talked of the ideologies of jihad in chat rooms and that 90 percent of his online conversations were translations.\n\"These are not things mainstream Americans agree with,\" he told the jury. \"But nonetheless, it's supposed to be protected by the First Amendment.\"\nBut according to Kamal, the jihad plans were real --- so real that he got scared and typed a note to tell his friends he could no longer participate. He slipped the note under a friend's door, stopped answering their calls and changed his e-mail address, said Kamal, a former Georgia State student.\nThe note came after hours spent watching Taliban recruitment speeches and videos on how to make improvised explosive devices and working out to prepare for jihad battles, Kamal said. The group even talked about potential terrorist targets, including the White House and the U.S. Capitol, Kamal said.\nSadequee continued those talks in 2005 in Canada, where he met with suspected terrorists, prosecutors said. He also made a video of the U.S. Capitol, the World Bank and the U.S. Department of Energy, which he sent encrypted to London terrorists, prosecutors said.\nSadequee's family issued a statement saying he faces charges that \"rely on scant evidence of teenagers chatting back and forth, plans for a Web site that included translations of previously published scholarly texts, and photos of buildings that were never disseminated or posted.\"\nThe trial is expected to continue throughout the week. Sadequee was arrested in 2006. If convicted, Sadequee faces more than 20 years in prison.\n\nLoad-Date: August 5, 2009"
