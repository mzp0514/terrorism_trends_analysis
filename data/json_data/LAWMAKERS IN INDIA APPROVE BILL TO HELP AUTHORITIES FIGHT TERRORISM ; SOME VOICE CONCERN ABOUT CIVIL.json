    "full text": "Lawmakers passed an anti-terrorism bill Tuesday after a day of heated debate in a joint session of Parliament, only the third since India gained independence.\nThe government said the legislation was crucial after the attacks of Sept. 11 in the United States and an attack Dec. 13 on the Indian Parliament.\n\"We cannot score a decisive victory against terrorism unless a special law of this kind is enacted,\" Interior Minister Lal Krishna Advani said as he presented the bill.\nOpponents denounced the bill as a Draconian curtailment of civil rights and voiced concerns that the Hindu nationalist-led government would use the law selectively against Muslims and political rivals.\nThe Prevention of Terrorism bill would allow police to detain suspects for questioning for three months without bringing charges against them and three more months with approval from a special court. The bill also would allow the government to try anyone who is suspected of giving money, shelter, transportation or other support to terrorists.\nIt would provide punishments ranging from a minimum of five years in prison to death.\nAfter nine hours of debate Tuesday, the bill was passed 425-296, with 60 of the 781 Parliament members absent or abstaining. The figurehead president, Kocheril Narayanan, was expected to sign it within a week, the last step before it becomes law.\nThe government says the law will be effective against Islamic separatists in Jammu-Kashmir, India's only Muslim majority state. India blames the militants for the attack on Parliament and says they were aided by Pakistan.\nLeaders of the opposition Congress party said that under the measure, people who unwittingly rent a room or car to suspected terrorists or engage in financial transactions with them could be detained for up to six months without trial and have their homes or businesses seized.\nThe bill would change Indian law to admit confessions made to police as evidence. Current law prohibits such confessions unless they are made voluntarily in court.\nThe government said it had included safeguards against abuse in the bill.\n\nNotes\n\nWAR ON TERROR\n\nLoad-Date: March 27, 2002"
