    "full text": "Despite the Bush administration's claims that the Patriot Act is an effective tool against the war on terrorism, the law must be revoked, a number of opponents told a Georgia State University forum on Saturday.\n\"We demand nothing less than full restoration of our civil rights,\" Kellie Gasnik, a candidate for alderman in Savannah who is running on a platform opposing the law, said to applause at the GSU Student Center. \"Resist and repeal the USA Patriot Act.\"\nAJC\nThe forum, Silencing Dissent in the Age of the Patriot Act, attracted more than 150 people and featured speakers who denounced the Bush administration and the controversial anti-terrorism law passed in the weeks following the Sept. 11 attacks.\nThe Patriot Act, passed without significant debate in Congress, greatly expands the government's surveillance and police powers in terrorism investigations. Since its passage, more than 150 U.S. communities have passed resolutions denouncing the law.\nIn response, Attorney General John Ashcroft has been speaking nationwide in an attempt to prop up support for the act. In a speech earlier this month in College Park, Ashcroft credited the Patriot Act with helping \"win the war on terror.\"\nThe law has provided federal agents the necessary tools \"to prevent terrorists from unleashing more death and destruction on our soil,\" Ashcroft said. Justice Department officials also have said that since Sept. 11 the law has helped bring 255 criminal charges in terrorism-related cases and neutralize terrorist cells in Buffalo, N.Y.; Detroit; Portland, Ore.; and Seattle.\nBut Gasnik, coordinator of the National Coalition to Repeal the USA Patriot Act, said that since Ashcroft began his tour last month a dozen more communities had passed resolutions opposing the law.\n\"We won't be fooled,\" she said, accusing the attorney general of waging a \"campaign of misinformation.\"\nAlso speaking Saturday was the daughter of imprisoned University of South Florida professor Sami Al-Arian. Al-Arian, 53, who spoke out against the Patriot Act after its passage, faces terrorism charges that he was the North American leader of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\nLaila Al-Arian, 21, of Washington accused the Justice Department of charging her father to stifle criticism of the law. \"My father is in prison today because he spoke the truth,\" she said.\nThe biggest ovation Saturday was reserved for former Rep. Cynthia McKinney, who challenged forum attendees to speak out against the law and Bush administration policies.\n\"Every time we fail to act, those who do not hold our beliefs become emboldened,\" said the former DeKalb County congresswoman, now a speaker on the national lecture circuit and a Cornell University faculty member.\n\nLoad-Date: September 21, 2003"
