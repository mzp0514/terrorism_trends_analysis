    "full text": "The Islamic fundamentalist Al-Gamaa Al-Islamiya, or Islamic Group, claimed responsibility yesterday for a rifle and grenade attack in which Egypt's top anti-terrorism official was killed.\nThe group threatened further assaults on intelligence and law enforcement officials in its statement, which was faxed to a Western news agency.\nThe killing Saturday night was the most daring operation carried out in Cairo in the two-year campaign by Muslim radicals to overthrow the secular government and turn Egypt into an Islamic state.\nThe government had claimed to have curbed the extremists, but the attack showed they could strike in the capital and kill the man assigned to destroy them. The victim, Maj. Gen. Raouf Khayrat, 48, was deputy chief of state security intelligence in charge of religious terrorist activities.\nInterior Minister Hassan al-Alfy, speaking yesterday at Khayrat's funeral, said: \"The terrorist operations only increase the police determination to confront terrorism.\"\nThe Islamic Group has been blamed for much of the violence. It also claimed responsibility yesterday for the March 31 bombing of a suburban Cairo bank in which an employee was injured. It was the ninth bank attack since February.\nPolice believe five gunmen attacking from a motorcycle and a car carried out the assassination of Khayrat as he left his home near the Giza Pyramids.\nThe slaying of Khayrat was the first major attack in Cairo since a homemade bomb was thrown at a tourist bus last December, wounding eight Austrians and as many Egyptians.\n\nLoad-Date: October 21, 2002"
