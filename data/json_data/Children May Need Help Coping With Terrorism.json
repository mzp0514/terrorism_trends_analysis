The answer is, it depends on the age group.\nChildren are \"the most affected and probably the least managed\" group of Americans now living through the consequences of the Sept. 11 attacks, says Judith Myer Walls, a child development expert at Purdue University.\nWalls offers extensive advice online on how to talk to children about terrorism at www.ces.purdue.edu/terrorism/children \nFor preschoolers, Walls suggests some reassuring holding and hugging. This age group is sensitive to what adults are feeling and cannot separate media images from reality.\nFor children in elementary school, Walls suggests assessing a child's understanding to see if he or she knows the difference between media reports and the entertainment shows they watch on television. Children this age can benefit from expressing their ideas in art, letters, music and with puppets.\nMichael Rank, co-director of the International Traumatology Institute in Tampa, says his 6-year-old son drew images of an airplane flying into the World Trade Center and people falling out on their heads after Sept. 11.\n\"This is a reality that I really hadn't discussed with him,\" Rank says. \"I don't know where he picked it up, and he really can't tell me much about it. It occurred to me it's going to be a completely new perception and world view for the children who experienced 9/11.\"\nWalls says adolescents might act like they don't care, but this is often an attempt to look strong and save face.\nThey will want more detail and have more coping strategies but still might not deal with terrorism issues the same way adults do.\nParents should note feelings might change as teenagers learn more and get used to the situation. Walls suggests parents tell older children how they and others feel and let kids be in charge of their feelings.\n\nLoad-Date: January 15, 2002"
