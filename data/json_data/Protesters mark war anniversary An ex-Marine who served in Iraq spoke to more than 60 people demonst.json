Just remember something, and that's that fear begets hate, hate begets war, war begets violence and death, and violence and death is not what America is about.\"\nSteve Fryburg, director of the Dayton International Peace Museum and member of Veterans for Peace, said the war on terrorism won't be won by \"guns and bombs\" but through diplomacy and \"winning hearts and minds.\"\n\"Our foreign policy stinks, people, and it's up to us to get our leaders to change it,\" Fryburg said. \"We're a very, very creative people in this country, and we need to start creating a peaceful future.\"\nMembers of Dayton Peace Action, the September 11 Coalition and the national organization Military Families Speak Out joined the rally, carrying signs that read, \"Bring Our Troops Home - End the War\"; \"No More Blood for Oil\"; \"Impeach Cheney/Bush Now\", and \"War Breeds Terrorism.\"\nLocal Roman Catholic educator Gloria Leigh borrowed a line from the late civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer in telling the crowd, \"I am sick and tired of being sick and tired of wealthy white men starting wars and forcing poor whites, poor blacks and poor Hispanics to fight them.\"\n\"I am sick and tired of the claim we are a Christian nation,\" Leigh continued. \"This nation and its leaders and far too many of its citizens have violated every discipline and principle established by Jesus Christ.\"\n?
