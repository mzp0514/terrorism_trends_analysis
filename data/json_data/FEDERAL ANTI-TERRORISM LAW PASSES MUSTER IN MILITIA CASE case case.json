James \"Rich\" Rogers\nthat the 1994 law is unconstitutionally vague.\nLooker and Rogers are among seven men with ties to the Mountaineer\nMilitia accused of plotting to blow up the FBI fingerprint center in\nClarksburg last year.  year.  year.\n\"A person who wanted to obey the law could understand the offense,\"\nMagistrate James E. Seibert wrote Wednesday in U.S. District Court in\nWheeling.\nThe law that makes it a crime to provide resources to terrorist\norganizations was used for the first time against Looker and Rogers,\nU.S. Attorney William Wilmoth said.\nRogers is accused of making photograph copies of blueprints of the FBI\ncenter. Looker sold them to fictitious Middle East terrorist for\n$ 50,000, prosecutors allege.\nResources identified under the law include money, lodging, safe\nhouses, false documents, communication equipment, weapons, explosives,\ntransportation and \"other physical assets.\"\nDefense lawyers contend the wording \"other physical assets\" is so\nbroad people must guess its meaning.\nAssistant U.S. Attorney David Godwin conceded the wording is broad but\nsaid the law is specific.\nHe said it targets those who provide resources knowing they will be\nused in a terrorist act.\nThe magistrate agreed.\n\"Don't give anything to a person who wants to use that object to\ncommit a crime. I think it is clear and therefore not\nunconstitutionally vague,\" Seibert wrote.\nIt is up to U.S. District Judge Frederick Stamp Jr. to accept or\nreject the magistrate's recommendation.\n\"I think that the law that Congress drafted is sufficiently clear to\nallow a defendant to know what he's being charged with, which is what\nthe Constitution requires,\" Wilmoth said.\nRogers' attorney, Gary Zimmerman in Pittsburgh, said Thursday he\nlikely would appeal but declined further comment, saying he had not\nyet received the ruling.\nRogers, of Jane Lew, Lewis County, faces two counts, while Looker, of\nStonewood, Harrison County, faces three counts.\nThe five others charged with Looker and Rogers are from West Virginia,\nOhio and Pennsylvania.

Those items included a handgun and\nshotgun shells taken from a bag under his fire station locker.\nRogers contended FBI agents never read him his Miranda rights and they\nmisled him into believing they were looking only for photographs\nbefore they searched the bag.\nZimmerman also argued in his motions that an FBI agent failed to raise\nquestions as to whether Rogers actually took the photographs when\nseeking the original search warrant.\nRogers told the informant in the case that someone else took the\nphotographs, Zimmerman's motions said.  said.  said.\n\nLoad-Date: May 16, 1997"
