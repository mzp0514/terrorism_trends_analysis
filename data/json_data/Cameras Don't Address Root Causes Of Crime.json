    "full text": "TO THE EDITORS:\nPervasive and omnipresent monitoring of citizens with surveillance cameras is not a solution. It is a symptom of failure to aggressively and successfully confront the root causes of crime and deterioration in the city.\nRoot causes are illegal drug use, slumlords, low incomes, rapid conversion of private homes to apartments, junk cars on the street, a shrinking tax base, people with disgusting habits and no regard for neighbors, deadbeats gaming the system, and inadequate response to complaints.\nFor the time being, cameras have won the popularity contest, but cameras don't do well in studies regarding crime prevention, and cameras don't assuage concerns about privacy rights, an accepted part of Americana, or concerns about intrusion of \"Big Brother,\" George Orwell's warning in his book, \"1984.\" Those who didn't read this book may believe it to be a literary farce, but deep-thinking people see it as a serious warning.\nCameras monitoring hotels, stores or specific high crime areas are one thing, cameras almost everywhere is something totally different - especially when technology already exists that could take these cameras to another level.\nThe post 9/11 world has resulted in people being willing to trade privacy for protection against terrorism. Lancaster's problem isn't terrorism. Scary!\nRuss Laudenberger\nLancaster\n\nLoad-Date: September 28, 2009"
