The defendants are charged with plotting a war of urban terrorism.\nDefense attorneys said they expected Abdel-Rahman, 56, who suffers from chronic diabetes and heart disease, to return to his detention cell by the end of the week, but that he would be too weak to stand trial. \"I don't have any choice,\" Judge Michael B. Mukasey said, postponing jury selection until Jan. 9. LA Times REFUGEES U.S. Must Allow Haitian Children To Enter, Judge Says\nHundreds of Haitian children who have been living for months in U.S. tent camps in Cuba will be allowed to enter the United States, a federal judge in Miami ruled Tuesday.\nRuling on a motion filed by refugee advocates on behalf of 230 unaccompanied Haitian children at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, U.S. District Judge C. Clyde Atkins said the Haitian refugees should be granted the same parole as that given Cuban children.\n\"This is the right thing to do,\" said Steven Forester, consulting attorney for the Haitian Refugee Center in Miami, which filed the motion. \"Before Thanksgiving the government should bring in the children, some of whose parents have been killed by the Haitian military,\" he said.
