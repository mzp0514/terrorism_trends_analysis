    "full text": "To the Editor:\nPerhaps it is too obvious to be worthy of comment, but I think not. The topic is the near-hysterical condemnation by those on the righteous right of the African National Congress and their demand for the scalp of Secretary of State George P. Shultz for meeting with Oliver R. Tambo, the leader of the A.N.C., on Jan. 28, on the ground that the A.N.C. is synonymous with violence and giving the organization any recognition is to give tacit approval to terrorism.\nIt all seems disingenuous in light of the ultraright's support of clandestine, violent and terroristic movements around the world, even as their chorus condemning Mr. Shultz reaches its shrill and ever-moralistic crescendo. They support terrorism of every stripe in their efforts to unseat governments in Nicaragua, Afghanistan and Iran. These are all obvious and well publicized. But what of their recent reception in Washington of Jonas Savimbi (hardly a choirboy), who seeks to do in Angola almost precisely what Oliver Tambo is attempting in South Africa? Their goals and methods are closely parallel, but Mr. Savimbi is heralded as some kind of a folk hero-freedom fighter to whom they encourage massive shipments of arms and accouterments.\nTo make this statement is neither to bless nor to excuse the brutality of the A.N.C., but to expose the hypocrisy of this claque. One has to wonder how much longer we shall have to wait for the re-emergence of the principled Republicans of another era: the Eisenhowers, the Scrantons and the Tafts.\n \nH. KENNETH BUTERA\nKing of Prussia, Pa., Jan. 29, 1987"
