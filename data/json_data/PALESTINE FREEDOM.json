    "full text": "I am a member of the Pittsburgh Jewish community. I have friends who support Israel's policies regarding Palestine out of loyalty and affection for the Jewish state. I have other Jewish friends who feel the opposite - they support the Palestinian cause as they would any people living under oppression. I agree with the latter group.\nLike any of us, the residents of Palestine need food, jobs, health care, infrastructure and freedom of movement. Throughout history, groups deprived of these basic freedoms fight back, even against overwhelming power and certain retaliation. Hence we now are witnessing border protests by tens of thousands of Gazans despite the expected Israeli response. Thus far, the Israeli military has killed 60 and wounded more than 2,000 Gazans.\nThis cycle of protest and violence is long-standing. It has not just had wrenching effects on the people of Israel-Palestine but has contributed to hatred and terrorism throughout the world.\nTo break the cycle, the stronger power - Israel - should take the first step and give Palestine its freedom, provide the initial economic support for its basic needs and work on deeper long-term reconciliation.\nI expect some people will see this as naive. I feel that what is truly naive is the idea that this problem can be solved by military might with its unavoidable cruel consequences.\n\nLoad-Date: May 17, 2018"
