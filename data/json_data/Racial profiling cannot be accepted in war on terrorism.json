    "full text": "Gov. Frank Keating has come out in favor of racial profiling in the war on terrorism. Keating said, \"it is negligent not to look at everything, including racial factors.\"\nU. Oklahoma\nRacial profiling for any purpose is controversial at best, and unconstitutional at worst. For Keating to endorse such a practice is unacceptable.\nConsider Oklahoma's own situation. Following the Oklahoma City bombing, it was suspected that various Middle Eastern groups were to blame. In the end, the terrorist was a white male with a crew cut and a dislike of big government. If Keating is a proponent of profiling, his position would indict half of his own state, including a large amount of his own voting base.\nKeating said he thinks it is negligent to avoid profiling people who speak Arabic or read the Koran. Whether it would save time or money, such practices are illegal. Even if the profiled subjects are innocent, their time has been wasted and they have been inconvenienced because of their race or religion. This is discrimination, plain and simple.\nIf anything, profiling makes it easier for some terrorists to operate. Richard Reid, the airline shoe-bomber, had no problem making it through security checkpoints. If airline security agents are busy investigating everybody with a Koran, all a potential terrorist has to do is grab a Bible and don a baseball cap to make it through.\nUnless Keating is willing to include those who resemble Timothy McVeigh in his profiles, we suggest he back off from encouraging discriminating practices in our current battle against terrorism.\n(C) 2002 Oklahoma Daily via U-WIRE\n\nLoad-Date: February 4, 2002"
