ASPOWS sent a memorandum to the Chief Minister with a total of three demands - recruiting 1214 SPO soldiers whose name are online among the 5694 Assam Police Constables post that will be recruited soon, recruiting the SPO soldiers in AISF and ASRF in the posts that are laying vacant, if any of the SPO soldiers left after recruitment in the said posts, the rest should be appointed in different government and semi-government departments.\n\nExpressing their pitiable condition the SPO soldiers said that it is a matter of dismay that after putting lives in danger in order to establish a peaceful environment, instead of being rewarded for what they did, the SPOs got thrown out from their job. ASPOWS also mentioned in their memorandum that it is nothing except betrayal that the SPOs were thrown out from their job after the desired motive of establishing peace in those areas reached a positive outcome. ASPOWS claimed that it is a matter of pride that they could succeed to resolve the issues of terrorism as well as communal fight especially in Kokrajhar and Dima Hasao area.\n\n\nLoad-Date: September 26, 2019"
