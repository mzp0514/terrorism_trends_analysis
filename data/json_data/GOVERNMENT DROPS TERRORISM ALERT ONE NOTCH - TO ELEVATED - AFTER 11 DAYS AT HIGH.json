Officials were also worried about a possible attack on Memorial Day, which passed without incident.\n\"The lowering of the threat level is not a signal to government, law enforcement or citizens that the danger of a terrorist attack has passed,\" Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge said in a statement. \"The U.S. intelligence community remains concerned that al-Qaida is attempting to exploit our weaknesses and believes that the United States and its interests are still at a significant risk of terrorist attack.\"\nRidge said the government \"will continue to have security measures in place at federal facilities and other key areas of the country.\" No domestic terrorist strikes were attempted during the relatively brief orange alert that just ended. Previous alerts lasted roughly a month.\nYellow indicates an elevated risk of terrorist attack, while the old level, orange, means a high risk.\nYellow is the middle level on a five-color scale. The lowest two le vels, green and blue, and the highest, red, have not been used since the system was adopted in March 2002.\nHomeland Security Department officials say the system serves as guidance for law enforcement authorities, businesses and the public on how likely a terrorist attack is at a given time.\nThe alert level was raised May 20 after terrorists believed to be linked to al-Qaida struck in Saudi Arabia and Morocco. Seventy-five people were killed, including eight Americans.\nAt the time, Ridge said it was feared the incidents could mark the beginning of a wave of worldwide attacks that could include U.S. targets.\nWith the alert, government authorities and businesses stepped up security, particularly at Memorial Day gatherings. Lowering the alert level allows authorities to scale back some measures, a move favored by many local governments struggling with budget shortfalls.\nThe terrorism alert has been at orange four times since the system was put in place. No domestic attacks have occurred during any of the alerts.\nWhile some have raised concerns that too many nonspecific alerts will desensitize the public, officials say they have little choice but to put them out in the face of very real threats. Homeland Security officials believe that increased security accompanying the alerts deters would-be terrorists from striking.\nU.S. officials suspect al-Qaida's top leaders coordinated the Morocco and Saudi Arabia attacks to demonstrate al-Qaida still is viable.\n\nNotes\n\nTOP OF THE NEWS\n\nLoad-Date: May 31, 2003"
