McDonald, 26, of Neenah, an armor crew member, died Monday at the base, but officials refused to say how it happened or release other information.\nMcDonald was assigned to the Rear Detachment, 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment.\nIn Wisconsin, McDonald's parents said they were notified Tuesday morning that their son died in his barracks. They said they expected to learn more of the circumstances Wednesday.\nHe had planned to leave the Army in January to pursue a career in firefighting, they said.\n\"Jim wanted to become a firefighter,\" his father Douglas McDonald said. \"He had some training in the Army and was planning on moving back to the area.\"\nHe was injured in a roadside bomb blast in Iraq in May and then returned to Fort Hood, where he received the Purple Heart award July 24, the parents said.\nDouglas McDonald said his son became interested in the military while in high school after joining a cadet program at the Appleton National Guard Armory.\n\"That's kind of what got him started,\" he said. \"He had two tours of duty in Iraq and Baghdad. He loved the service, the guys he was with and his whole unit.\"\nHe said his son wanted to return to his unit in Iraq, but his injuries were still in the recovery stage, preventing his deployment.\nIn his five years of service, he received several other awards, including the Army Commendation Medal, Good Conduct Medal, Humanitarian Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and Army Service Ribbon.\n\nLoad-Date: November 15, 2007"
