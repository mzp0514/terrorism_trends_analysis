    "full text": "TO THE EDITOR: Recent writers have disagreed about comparing Iraq and Vietnam. Different places and different enemies but similar in that in both our leaders got the mistaken idea that military occupation can defeat an ideology.\n#750890.wrk#The occupying power gets blamed by the people for everything that goes wrong, as the Soviets who occupied Eastern Europe from 1945 to 1989 found out. Where of communism was overcome was in Eastern Europe. The West did not attack and occupy this area, but through the Marshall Plan, assisted western Europe to become a model the the Eastern Europeans. Occupation breeds resentment. If al-Qaida in 2001 was motivated by the presence of our infidel military in Saudi Arabia (still a very nondemocratic place despite years of our presence), the idea that our continued occupation of Iraq is going to reduce terrorism doesnt make much logical sense especially given the ill-planned policies such as the abuse of prisoners. We who opposed the Iraq war are sometimes accused of not taking the problem of terrorism seriously. On the contrary, those who supported and planned this war are the ones who are not being serious about studying carefully how people who fall for enemy ideologies can be won over. The success of the Marshall Plan and the peaceful end of European communism is a prime example. Richard Paul Moyer, Ephrata\n\nLoad-Date: October 17, 2005"
