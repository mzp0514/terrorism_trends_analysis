He said he believes the improvement has made the U.S. more competent in battling terrorism.\n\"By working with other intelligence community members to understand the [terrorist networks], we could take action and slow down their ability to work even at a district level,\" McRaven said.\nClapper also said that the nation is currently in a new and challenging position because of the mass number of threats present. According to Clapper, who was appointed to his position in 2010, the current standing of the nation is more advanced in terms of technology than it has been in years, but it does not mean that the country is safer from possible threats.\n\"Threat is spreading, as seen with the al-Qaida franchises, and this sounds gloomy,\" Clapper said. \"We're far smarter, but I cannot say we're safer.\"\nThe U.S. currently faces many problems, such as budget cuts and the consequences of leaked information, and Clapper said these problems make up a \"storm threat\" that is degrading the nation's capability to counteract any threat.\nAs a response, according to Clapper, the nation is moving to a more transparent system that can help citizens understand what is going on and reduce the effects of leaked information.\nSamantha Minkowitz, government junior who attended the discussion, said she found Clapper's assessment of the nation's security surprising.\n\"What shocked me the most was that we're in a time when we're experiencing the most array of threats that the nation has experienced in over 50 years,\" Minkowitz said. \"I really thought we were a lot safer, so it really opened my eyes to be more aware of the country that I live in.\"\n\nLoad-Date: October 17, 2014"
