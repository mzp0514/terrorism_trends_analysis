Could you have thought that we would be watching the evening news and hearing awful stories of man's inhumanity to man, from the \nbeheading of Americans to the gassing of entire villages?\nProbably not. Terrorism was not at the top of our fear list. It was still something more likely to happen in some backwater country.\n❖ ❖ ❖\nI was hardly prescient sitting there at my desk trying to pound out a column for the special edition we decided to put on the street that morning. In fact I was writing the column at the same time I stared at a TV screen in the newsroom, watching chaos in New York and hearing reports of similar destruction at the Pentagon and jets that were unaccounted for elsewhere.\nIt was too early to speculate with any facts other than the obvious that what was happening around us was no accident.\nThe only break I took from the column was to walk a few feet over to the huge window that offered a view of the city across the river, wondering whether somewhere out there one of those aircraft might be headed toward MacDill Air Force Base.\nThat night, after sitting in front of the TV with the family trying to soak in everything that had happened, I took our dogs for a walk down Bayshore Boulevard. \nIt was quieter than usual. As I recall there weren't any joggers and the only traffic seemed to be going toward the base at the end of Bayshore. I remember staring out at Hillsborough Bay and wondering whether the bad guys were anywhere out there plotting against the base or our city.\n❖ ❖ ❖\nThe ensuing days were equally compelling as a change came over all of us. There was the strangeness of no aircraft flying overhead. There was a bonding, not just with friends and family but with people we didn't know, a sort of national huddling together.\nThe so-called Bayshore Patriots showed up at Bay to Bay Boulevard and Bayshore to wave American flags in support of those who drove by on their way to the base.\nI think in the back of our minds we all knew that our world was changed forever, but we weren't sure how much. We probably all realized there would be increasing layers of security and that our private lives would become less so.\nI don't know that at the time we believed our own government would probe so deeply into our conversations and movements or that technology with its drones and cameras would be nearly as threatening to our way of life as the terrorists themselves.\nToday there are at least as many questions and worries as there were that painful day 13 years ago. I think the answers are just as cloudy.\nAt the very least you might hope we could resurrect a little of the spirit that was there immediately after 9/11.
