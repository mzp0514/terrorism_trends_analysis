    "full text": "Five days after reports that the CIA had disrupted a new underwear bomb plot against a U.S.-bound airliner, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly says the feds are still keeping the NYPD in the dark on the details.\nTwo words: outrageous and dangerous.\nBits and pieces of the complicated story - involving a double agent who may or may not have been working for the Saudis, who may or may not have had a British passport - have made their way into media reports.\nThere was one wave of leaks, then another. British and U.S. intelligence are said to be rattled by the disclosures.\nAt this point, the public doesn't need to know key facts. You know who does need to get the straight dope? The police department that protects the nation's largest city, which also happens to have America's most proactive and sophisticated local terrorism-fighting operation.\nThere's a thing called the Joint Terrorism Task Force. It was created to facilitate precisely this type of information sharing.\nAnd right now, it's sharing bupkus. Here's what Kelly said:\n\"There's a little bit of confusion. Different stories are coming out. But we're still trying to get some specificity as to precisely what happened.\"\nDoes the police bomb squad have information about how the underwear bomb was built?\n\"Not as yet. . . . We'd like to know the specifics of the device. We'd like to know the materials used, where those materials may be obtained, the shape and size of the device.\"\nWere New York City targets contemplated?\nWere there key sources or contacts who might further important leads - or signal to the NYPD that other trails of evidence aren't worth pursuing?\nInstead of leaking like sieves to the reported horror of intelligence professionals, the feds should have made briefing the NYPD a priority. That they have not smacks of turf warfare at its worst.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nNLVL\n\nLoad-Date: May 12, 2012"
