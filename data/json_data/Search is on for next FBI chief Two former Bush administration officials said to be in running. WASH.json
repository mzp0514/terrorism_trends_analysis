    "full text": "WASHINGTON - Two officials who worked for President George W. Bush, including one who threatened to resign to block legally questionable anti-terrorism surveillance, have a realistic chance of being asked to head the FBI, according to people familiar with the search.\nJames Comey and Kenneth Wainstein served in sensitive national security-related posts at the Justice Department in the Bush administration. That could make for interesting confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee if President Barack Obama nominates either to succeed FBI Director Robert Mueller. His 10-year, nonrenewable term expires Sept. 4.\nTheir service as political appointees under a Republican president is a key factor in explaining the rise of Comey and Wainstein in the search. Obama's administration faces an expanded Republican minority in the Senate with the votes to seriously complicate the confirmation prospects of any nominee.\nOn the other hand, Comey became a hero to Democratic opponents of Bush's warrantless wiretapping when Comey refused for a time to reauthorize it. Bush revised the surveillance program when confronted with the threat of resignation by Comey and Mueller.\nComey, as deputy attorney general in 2005, tried unsuccessfully to limit tough interrogation tactics against suspected terrorists. He told Attorney General Alberto Gonzales that some of the practices were wrong and would damage the department's reputation.\nSome Democrats denounced those methods as torture, particularly the use of waterboarding, which produces the sensation of drowning.\nWainstein was working for Mueller at the FBI when bureau agents at Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, objected to abusive interrogation techniques employed by the military and when Mueller decided FBI agents could not participate in interviews involving these techniques. But there is nothing in the public record to indicate Wainstein was drawn into the internal Bush administration debates over anti-terrorism interrogation tactics or surveillance.\nA Senate confirmation hearing would surely scrutinize his role and views on these events.\nOther names have surfaced.\nSen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., has backed New York Police Department Commissioner Ray Kelly, 69, a former top Treasury official who some believe would rather run for mayor of New York.\nThe FBI Agents Association has recommended Michael Mason, a 23-year bureau veteran who ran the Washington field office and became executive assistant director in charge of the bureau's criminal investigative division. Mason would be the FBI's first black director.\nOne possible candidate with a strong background fighting terrorism who served in the Bush administration is Michael Garcia, the former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. Garcia successfully prosecuted the mastermind in the first World Trade Center bombing case in the mid-1990s.\nGarcia also headed Immigrations and Customs Enforcement in the Department of Homeland Security and would be the bureau's first Hispanic director.\nYet a candidate such as Comey or Wainstein who is steeped in the battle against terrorism from a high-level position at the Justice Department could be a huge plus for a potential nominee.\n\nLoad-Date: March 22, 2011"
