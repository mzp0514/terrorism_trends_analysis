    "full text": "Harsch's prescription is, as always, simple: Indict Israel; exculpate the aggressor (''Terrorism,'' April 8).\nFar from being chiefly the outgrowth of Israeli policies, terrorism is actually a global phenomenon, a political disease that seeks to subvert Western democracy.\nHardly any Western nation has been immune to it.\nHarsch ignores the fact that terrorism in the Middle East is rooted in the culture of violence native to that region. In terms of the number of wars, duration of hostilities, and the number of soldiers and civilians killed, the Arab-Israeli conflict is overshadowed by intra-Arab and intra-Muslim violence. It has little to do with Israel, and will not disappear after a resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict.\nThe roots of Arab terrorism (he prefers to call it Palestinian ''activism'') are in the refugee camps. He neglects to mention that the oil-rich Arab states have contributed little to relieve this miserable condition. The Arab refugee question is unique, for it is the only one where nations willfully reject their own kin.\nThe Arab states have conspired to make camps squalid breeding grounds of resentment that could be exploited against Israel by funding, arming, training, and providing political and diplomatic support to terrorists.\nAll over the world there are groups - ethnic, religious, tribal, social, political - with grievances. If ''understanding'' were extended to their ''root causes,'' they would have carte blanche to murder innocents in order to gain redress. But murder is murder, and no grievance can justify it nor will ''understanding'' avert or eliminate terrorism.\nMichael Shiloh, Boston Consul General of Israel\n \nLetters are welcome. Only a selection can be published, subject to condensation, and none acknowledged. Please address to ''readers write.''"
