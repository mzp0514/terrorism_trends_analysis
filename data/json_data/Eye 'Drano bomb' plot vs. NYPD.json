The alert is being issued out of precaution.\"\nA second source said police are trying to determine if the plot is tied to any recent police activity, or if someone heard about it on the Internet and spread the word.\n\"Does it matter?\" the source said. \"Whatever the reason is, these things are dangerous.\"\nBy late Thursday, no officers in the Rockaways or elsewhere had been injured, nor had any such devices been found.\nDrano bombs, which can be made with any drain or toilet cleaner that contains hydrochloric acid, can cause chemical burns to the skin or even blindness.\nrparascandola@nydailynews.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \nNLVL\n\nLoad-Date: April 13, 2012"
