In 1997, the ICRC admitted a \"moral failure\" in keeping silent about the Nazi genocide of Jews during World War II, even though it had documented mass deportations and killings.\nOTTAWA (AP) - One of Canada's most contentious anti-terrorism provisions was struck down Friday by the Supreme Court, which declared it unconstitutional to detain foreign terror suspects indefinitely while the courts review their deportation orders.\nThe 9-0 ruling was a blow to the government's anti-terrorism regulations. Five Arab Muslim men have been held for years under the \"security certificate\" program, which the Justice Department had insisted is a key tool in the fight against global terrorism and essential to Canada's security.\nThe court found that the system violates the Charter of Rights and Freedom, Canada's bill of rights.\n\nLoad-Date: February 26, 2007"
