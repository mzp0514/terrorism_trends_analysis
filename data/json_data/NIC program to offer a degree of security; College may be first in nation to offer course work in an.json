    "full text": "Two months before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, before airport\n security workers were on the front lines and postal workers were exposed to\n anthrax, local military survival training specialist David Dose approached\n North Idaho College with an idea.\n What if the college were to become one of the first academic institutions\n in the nation to offer an anti-terrorism training program?\n After all, Dose said then, the world was changing, and it wasn't only elite\n Air Force pilots and specially trained ground forces that needed the tools to\n survive in a world where terrorism was a grim reality.\n''The military and the government sometimes believe only certain folks are\n at a high enough risk to spend the money to train somewhere, but now a whole\n lot of Americans could find themselves on the front lines,\" Dose said.\n Even back in July, the college was intrigued. And so on Tuesday, a month\n and a half after the attacks that made Dose's point better than he ever could,\n the college announced plans to launch its new anti-terrorism and work force\n security program, officially called the Fort Sherman Institute for Human\n Protection.\n The college is putting up $100,000 to finance the program and also will\n seek private and state grants to defray costs.\n The program will be aimed at those who might confront terrorism on the job.\n That could include anyone from local law enforcement to state or federal\n agencies looking to outsource employee training, to corporate workers planning\n to travel abroad, Dose said Tuesday.\n Teachers will be members of the military and other colleagues of Dose, who\n has consulted for the Department of Defense on specialized survivor training\n while based at Fairchild Air Force Base, near Spokane.\n College officials could not find any other U.S. academic institution that\n offers a similar program, said Robert Ketchum, the college's assistant vice\n president for instruction.\n Organizers are hoping that courses will begin in the next few months, once\n enough students sign up. They envision three levels of courses, which will\n each run over a few days.\n The first level, at a cost of $900, targets those at moderate risk of\n encountering terrorism and will address anti-terrorism safety mechanisms,\n preparing for overseas travel, how to recognize threats, personal protection\n measures and the basics of surviving a hostage situation, among other topics.\n The second set of courses, for $600, is for people in more high-risk\n situations, and include sessions on how to negotiate with terrorists and\n captors, the psychology of captivity and how to understand the politics that\n surround a hostage situation.\n The third set is for agency leaders or corporate executives who may be\n responsible for setting policy on terrorism and emergency situations, and\n costs $10,000 for eight people.\n The program will be based at NIC's Workforce Training Center in Post Falls,\n and could expand to include other facets, such as:\n A yearly conference on work force protection issues in Coeur d'Alene;\n Specialized training for public school educators who are developing safety\n policies for their schools;\n A two-year degree program in transportation and airport security.\n Survival training exists in the Inland Northwest, via the survival school\n at Fairchild, but that is restricted to the military. Private companies and\n individuals do anti-terrorism and work force security work, but have few\n academic competitors.\n ''The president has called for help, the office of homeland security has\n called for ideas,\" said Dose, who starts work at NIC on Thursday. ''This is\n our idea. I want to see Idaho become one of the first states in the union to\n join in the campaign against terrorism.\"\n\nLoad-Date: October 25, 2001"
