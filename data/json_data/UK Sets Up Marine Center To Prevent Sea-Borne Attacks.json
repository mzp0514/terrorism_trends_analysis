The former head of the British Navy said globalization and mass movement of goods across the world meant crime at sea could affect the UK&apos;s national interest.\nThe Â£350,000 center would allow government agencies and departments to share information about activity at sea more efficiently, help officials to identify and counter potential threats to the UK at an earlier stage besides protecting its interests at home and abroad.\nThe NMIC, based at the national military control center at Northwood, Middlesex in north-west London, will involve the Navy, Customs, the UK Border Agency, the Serious Organized Crime Agency and the coast guards.\nThe monitoring center will target terrorism and other crimes, and respond to disasters as also scan and provide information on potential threats to the sailing events in the 2012 Olympics.\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\nCopyright(c) 2010 RTTNews.com, Inc.
