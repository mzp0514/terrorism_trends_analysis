    "full text": "Syria denounced U.S. economic sanctions on Wednesday, and other Arab countries - including close U.S. allies - joined in the criticism. Europe ignored the penalties by dispatching a trade delegation to Damascus.\nThe United States imposed the embargo on Tuesday as a response to allegations that Syria was supporting terrorism and undermining U.S. efforts in neighboring Iraq.\nSome Arabs questioned the validity of the measures and the motives behind them, saying they serve Israeli - not American - interests and could further antagonize Arab feelings toward the United States, already soured by the war in Iraq, the prisoner-abuse scandal and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nNeighboring Lebanon may prove to be a major loophole in the sanctions, which ban all U.S. exports to Syria except food and medicine and forbid flights between Syria and the United States. Goods have traditionally flowed across the border from Lebanon to Syria.\nTrade between the United States and Syria amounts to $300 million a ye ar and there are currently no flights between Syrian and U.S. airports. But the political effect of the measures could surpass the economic impact.\nThe sanctions authorize the U.S. Treasury Department to freeze the assets of Syrian nationals and entities involved in terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, the occupation of Lebanon and terrorism in Iraq. They also restrict relations between U.S. banks and the Syrian national bank.\n\nNotes\n\nWORLD\n\nLoad-Date: May 13, 2004"
