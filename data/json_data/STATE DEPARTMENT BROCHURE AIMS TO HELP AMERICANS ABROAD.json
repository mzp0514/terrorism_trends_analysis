    "full text": "THE State Department, calling itself the ''ultimate authority'' in overseas travel, has unveiled an ''Americans Abroad'' brochure featuring with topics ranging from getting a passport to terrorists.  ''The ugly faces of crime and terrorism have not disappeared,'' said Sheldon J. Krys, assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security.\n''But as with other dangers, the greater the number of precautions taken by any individual the less likely that he or she will have an unhappy experience.'' Work on the brochure, available free by mail, started in 1987 after Congress passed the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Anti-Terrorism Act, Krys said.  ''It really is broad security awareness and would be equally applicable if you were coming to this country,'' he said.  ''It says some of the things that you know but may not think of at the right moment, such as not accepting packages from people to carry on airplanes.'' Under the heading ''What To Do If There is an Incident,'' the brochure's suggestions for dealing with terrorists include: ''Do not engage in political discussions,'' ''Make any requests you have in short, simple sentences,'' and ''Do not try to be a hero.'' The brochure is designed for both first-time and seasoned travelers and suggests things to do before and during a trip.  ''It starts by saying learn about the country,'' Krys said.  A ''Getting Ready'' section covers passports and visas, money, medical care and insurance.  It also suggests ways to avoid becoming a crime victim, warns about harsh foreign laws and jail conditions and offers advice on getting legal aid abroad.  The brochure is available by writing to: Americans Abroad, Pueblo, Colo.  81009.\n\nLoad-Date: October 18, 1993"
