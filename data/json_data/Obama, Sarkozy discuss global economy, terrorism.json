President Barack Obama and French President Nicolas Sarkozy pledged to work together to address currency and other imbalances in the world economy as nations struggle to recover from the global crisis. \n\"Too many people are still out of work, too many businesses are still having problems getting financing, and there's still too many imbalances in the world economy that are inhibiting the prospects of growth,\" Obama said Monday, sitting alongside Sarkozy in the Oval Office. The French president had been expected to use his meeting with Obama to push for changes that would keep the global monetary system from relying so heavily on the dollar as the world's reserve currency. But Sarkozy said Monday that he recognized \"how important the U.S. dollar is as the world's number one currency.\" France currently holds the presidency of the Group of Eight industrialized economies and the larger Group of 20 leading rich and developing nations. In his turn at the helm of the G-20, Sarkozy is looking to change the international monetary system, though he has not proposed specifics about his plan. Obama and Sarkozy's meeting came after violence against American and French citizens: six people were killed, and Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was injured, in a shooting rampage Saturday in Arizona, while two French hostages were killed in a failed rescue attempt in Niger after a kidnapping blamed on al-Qaida. Sarkozy said the French people were deeply moved and saddened by the Arizona attack, and both leaders said the incident in Niger underscores the need to cooperate in combatting terrorism around the world. \"We have no choice but to go after these terrorists wherever they may be,\" Sarkozy said. \n\nLoad-Date: January 11, 2011"
