    "full text": "To the Editor:\nMichael Field (Op-Ed, June 28) misses the mark when he dismissively refers to United States and Israeli \"paranoia\" regarding Iran. To the contrary, the United States and Israel are doing the civilized world an enormous favor by focusing attention on the threat posed by Iran.\nThe State Department's latest \"Patterns of Global Terrorism\" report points to Iranian arms, financing and training for Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and Hamas \"to resist Israel and the peace process through violence and terrorism\" and names Iran \"the premier state sponsor of international terrorism.\"\nLet's not forget, too, that when Secretary of State Warren Christopher was trying to reach an agreement to end hostilities in Lebanon, Iran was delivering, through Damascus, Katyusha rockets to Hezbollah to fire at Israeli towns and villages.  Paranoia? No, reality.\nFor years Iran has been intent on developing the ability to manufacture weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. Its Persian Gulf neighbors are worried, as are the United States and Israel.\nIn an American Jewish Committee study last year, Patrick Clawson of National Defense University in Washington wrote that despite Western restrictions on selling weapons and dual-use items to Iran, that country \"is still able to import a great many dangerous items\" from Europe and Asia. An Arab foreign minister told me of his fears that Russian arms merchants were seeking to sell nuclear components to Iran.\nTo deny the dangers Iran poses to regional and global stability is shortsighted.\n \nDAVID A. HARRIS\nExecutive Director\nAmerican Jewish Committee\nNew York, June 28, 1996\n\nLoad-Date: July 2, 1996"
