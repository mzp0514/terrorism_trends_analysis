With no additional information, the FBI conducted a limited inquiry and closed the case in June 2011.\nTwo years later, authorities say Tamerlan and his brother, Dzhohkar, detonated two homemade bombs near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three and injuring more than 260. Tamerlan was killed in a police shootout and Dzhohkar is under arrest.\nIn the past week, Russian authorities turned over to the United States information it had on Tamerlan and his mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva. The Tsarnaevs are ethnic Chechens who emigrated from southern Russia to the Boston area over the past 11 years.\nEven had the FBI received the information from the Russian wiretaps earlier, it's not clear the government could have prevented the attack.\nIn early 2011, the Russian internal security service intercepted a conversation between Tamerlan and his mother vaguely discussing jihad, according to U.S. officials.\nThe two discussed the possibility of Tamerlan going to Palestine, but he told his mother he didn't speak the language there, according to the officials, who reviewed the information Russia shared with the U.S.\nIn a second call, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva spoke with a man in the Caucasus region of Russia who was under FBI investigation. There was no information in the conversation that suggested a plot inside the United States, officials said.\nIt was not immediately clear why Russian authorities didn't share more information at the time. Jim Treacy, the FBI's legal attache in Moscow between 2007 and 2009, said the Russians long asked for U.S. assistance regarding Chechen activity in the United States.\nthat might be related to terrorism.\n\"On any given day, you can get some very good cooperation,\" Treacy said. \"The next you might find yourself totally shut out.\"\nZubeidat Tsarnaeva has denied that she or her sons were involved in terrorism. She has said she believed her sons have been framed by U.S. authorities.\nBut Ruslan Tsarni, an uncle of the Tsarnaev brothers and Zubeidat's former brother-in-law, said Saturday he believes the mother had a \"big-time influence\" as her older son increasingly embraced his Muslim faith and decided to quit boxing and school.\nAfter receiving the narrow tip from Russia in March 2011, the FBI opened a preliminary investigation into Tamerlan and his mother. But the scope was extremely limited under the FBI's internal procedures.\nAfter a few months, they found no evidence Tamerlan or his mother were involved in terrorism.\nThe FBI asked Russia for more information. After hearing nothing, it closed the case in June 2011.\nIn the fall of 2011, the FSB contacted the CIA with the same information. Again the FBI asked Russia for more details and never heard back.\nAt that time, however, the CIA asked that Tamerlan's and his mother's name be entered into a massive U.S. terrorism database.\nThe CIA declined to comment Saturday.\nAuthorities have said they've seen no connection between the brothers and a foreign terrorist group. Dzhohkar told FBI interrogators that he and his brother were angry over wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the deaths of Muslim civilians there.\nFamily members have said Tamerlan was religiously apathetic until 2008 or 2009, when he met a conservative Muslim convert known only to the family as Misha. Misha, they said, steered Tamerlan toward a stricter version of Islam.\nTwo U.S. officials say investigators believe they have identified Misha. While it was not clear whether the FBI had spoken to him, the officials said they have not found a connection between Misha and the Boston attack or terrorism in general.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nAssociated Press Ron Fraser, wearing black hat at left, Rebecca Roche and Jocelyn Lescarbeau hug Cheryl Fraser after they crossed the finish line Saturday of the Boston Marathon.
