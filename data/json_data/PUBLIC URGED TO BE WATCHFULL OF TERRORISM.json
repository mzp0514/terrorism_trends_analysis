Police say he had bomb material in the trunk of a rented car on a ferry he took to Port Angeles, Wash., from Victoria, British Columbia.\nOn other topics, Berger said Baghdad's rejection of a U.N. plan to resume weapons inspections would help solidify support for sanctions against Iraq and he expressed optimism about the prospects for peace between Syria and Israel.\n\nLoad-Date: December 20, 1999"
