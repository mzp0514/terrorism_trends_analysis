Emerson said the only way to fight threats of anti-Semitic terrorism in the United States is to delegitimize radical groups.\nTheir beliefs and organizations should publicly be denounced by the government and the media. He doesn't believe restricting violent anti-Semitic rhetoric is a violation of the First Amendment since it is the responsibility of the government and the media to choose where to focus their attention.\nJust as an editor in a newspaper decides which editorial he will print, President Clinton should not be meeting and giving voice to radical Islamic groups.\nEmerson said the government has been more successful in denouncing and muffling ultra right-wing groups such as Neo-Nazis and now has to apply the same tactics for radical Muslim groups in the United States.\n(C) 1999 The Daily Free Press via U-WIRE\n\nLoad-Date: November 18, 1999"
