Crew members must show government-issued identification to board. Emergency plans are carefully considered and reviewed.\nDaily said Alter officials began considering safety issues when they realized that if terrorists could use planes as weapons, they could also use boats and barges.\nMost barges that run along the Mississippi River aren't considered prime terrorist targets, but precautions are still important, said Kristi Hynes, assistant supervisor for the U.S. Coast Guard's marine safety detachment in the Quad Cities. Corn, soybeans and coal are common cargo, but hazardous materials also are shipped.\nOn average, 240 to 300 towboats push barges through Lock and Dam 15 in the Quad Cities each month, according to the visitor center there. A typical tow pushes 15 barges.\nThe Coast Guard, along with the industry group American Waterways Operators, has helped barge line operators conduct safety reviews in the past year.\nThe model vessel security plan adopted by American Waterways Operators in May and revised this month is designed to lessen the chance that the vessels are used as weapons of mass destruction, according to the association.\nThe plan encourages awareness of security threats, training for employees and emergency response planning. It outlines how towboat operators should respond to various levels of threats and lists common cargo that could be used as weapons, an association press release says.\n\"With our barges, they might just get a little corn in the river, and that probably wouldn't be the front-page effect they'd want. But involving something like a riverboat casino might be a little different,\" said Daily.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nAP photo\n\nLoad-Date: October 24, 2002"
