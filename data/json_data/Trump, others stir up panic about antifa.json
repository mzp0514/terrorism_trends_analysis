Attorney General William Barr has claimed groups using \"antifa-like tactics\" fueled violent clashes in Minneapolis after the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes.\nHowever, FBI Director Christopher Wray told a congressional panel last Thursday that antifa is more of an ideology or a movement than an organization. While the FBI has had domestic terrorism investigations of \"violent anarchist extremists, any number of whom self identify with the antifa movement,\" Wray noted that extremists driven by white supremacist or anti-government ideologies have been responsible for most deadly attacks in the U.S. over the past few years.\nA man suspected of fatally shooting a Trump supporter after a pro-Trump caravan in Portland, Ore., last month had described himself in a social media post as \"100% ANTIFA.\" Federal agents later shot and killed the suspect, Michael Forest Reinoehl, in Washington state.\nBut federal arrest records of more than 300 people at protests across the country include very few obvious mentions of the word antifa. They could be hard to identify, however, because there is no domestic terrorism statute under which to charge protesters involved in violence or vandalism.\nLouisville, Ky.-based attorney David Mour has represented many protesters involved in demonstrations over the killing of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical technician who was shot by Louisville police officers when they barged into her house in the middle of the night to serve a search warrant. Protesters have occupied a square in downtown Louisville for more than three months. All along, Mour has dealt with wild rumors that antifa is somehow involved.\n\"It's constant. These people are just trying to generate fear and frenzy. They're trying to blame all this stuff on antifa, and I'm like, 'Who exactly is antifa? Where are they? Who are you talking about?' It's insane,\" he said.\nRutgers University historian Mark Bray, author of the book \"Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,\" said there are well organized, tightly knit antifa groups that have operated for years.\n\"But that's different from saying that the politics of antifa is just one single, monolithic organization, which is obviously false,\" said Bray, whose book traces the history and evolution of the movement.\nMany Americans had never heard of antifa before Trump's election and the violent clashes between far-right extremists and counterprotesters at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017. Bray said Trump's campaign and presidency stimulated far-right organizing and the antifascist response to it. He believes Trump and his allies are demonizing antifa for political gain.\n\"The portrayal they present serves their purposes of using it as a boogeyman to rally support and to kind of redirect attention away from the legitimate grievances behind the Black Lives Matter protests,\" he said.\nRumors of antifa invading Leitchfield, Ky., started on Facebook and quickly spread through the community. Stephanie Ann Fulkerson, who had organized the demonstration, was stunned. She usually keeps to herself but felt strongly enough about the Black Lives Matter movement that she decided to plan something in the small town in Grayson County about 70 miles south of Louisville.\nAs the protest got underway, residents lined up in front of businesses to guard against vandalism, some of them on motorcycles. A handful heckled the protesters. At one point, one of them stormed across the street toward the demonstration, but law enforcement restrained him.\nThe buses didn't show, but that didn't mean everyone accepted it was just a baseless rumor. Johnson said he heard that 15 antifa members in a Winnebago were stopped in town by local residents and law enforcement and complied with a command to go home.\nGrayson County Sheriff Norman Chaffins said that didn't happen.\n\"That's a rumor,\" the sheriff said. \"People are pretty detailed when they make up stories.\"\n\nLoad-Date: September 24, 2020"
