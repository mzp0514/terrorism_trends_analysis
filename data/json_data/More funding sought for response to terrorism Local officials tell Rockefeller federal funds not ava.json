You need to go back to Washington and plead our case.\"\nChief Deputy Kevin Quinlin suggested taking a regional approach to funding and training. Not all areas of the state need a bomb squad, he said.\nBut if several counties worked together, they could afford to staff and equip a squad that could still respond quickly to all areas in those counties.\nOthers suggested better communication between federal and local law enforcement officers.\nCharleston Police Chief Jerry Riffe said his police department gets along well with the local branches of national agencies like the FBI or ATF, but that federal officials in Washington should be quicker in disseminating information to local agencies.\n\"There's no rationale for people not sharing information within a state,\" Rockefeller said.\nRockefeller said about half the police departments in West Virginia don't have Internet access, which was also a problem in trying to combat terrorism.\nHe also said West Virginia doctors need training to help identify bioterrorism.\n\"Are we prepared (bioterrorism)?\" Rockefeller asked. \"No, we're not.\"\nWriter Deanna Wrenn can be reached at 348-1796 or by e-mail at dwrenn@dailymail.com.  \n\nLoad-Date: February 20, 2002"
