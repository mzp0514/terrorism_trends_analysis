We take all things like this seriously.\"\nThe graphic appeared on several Arabic-language sites including gulfup.com, Browne said.\nCops believe that it was posted by an Egyptian writer who regularly uses the\nInternet to spread propaganda about the terror network. The logo was posted in the \"artwork and design\" section on that particular Web page, Browne said.\n\"We've done an analysis. He's not an American. We\n're leaning toward (him being) an Egyptian, using Arabic, to create communications on this site,\" said Browne.\nThe feds are looking into the graphic as well.\n\"The FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force is aware of the posting and investigating its authenticity and origin,\" the bureau said in a statement. \"The FBI takes all threats seriously, and there is no specific or credible threat to New York at this time.\"\nThe NYPD Intelligence Division's cyberunit is working to find the origin of the photo and if it is considered to be a credible threat.\nBrowne said there is no chatter or intel to suggest N.Y.C. is going to be hit, but the \"obvious implications\" of that logo raised concerns.\nPolice officials have said New York remains the top target of terrorists around the globe.\nCops have held off taking any active steps until they determine the intent behind the chilling message.\n\"Because we haven't found any link to anything operational, we're not changing our posture as a result of this,\" Browne said.\nAuthorities have kept watch of all modes of communication since the 9/11 attacks on the city and Washington.\nIn 2011, FBI Director Robert Mueller told Congress the terror network has become adept at spreading propaganda over the web.\n\"In the past 10 years, Al Qaeda's online presence has become just as detrimental as its physical presence,\" Mueller said. \"Extremists are not limiting their use of the Internet to recruitment or radicalization; they are using it to incite terrorism.\"\nFaisal Shahzad, a Connecticut man trained by\nAl Qaeda overseas, parked a bomb-laden Nissan Pathfinder in Times Square, hoping to kill hundreds of people.\nShahzad told authorities that he was drawn to the cause by radical Muslim Anwar al-Awlaki.\nAwlaki used the Internet to spread his hate speech and communicate with his followers.\nrparascandola@nydailynews.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \nThe NYPD Intelligence Division cyberunit is investigating whether photo posted on the Internet is a credible threat or just a sick taunt.\n\nLoad-Date: April 3, 2012"
