They try to prevent attacks on power plants, pipelines, waterworks and other public utilities.\n     - Teaming some agents who battle organized crime by foreigners with agents focused on foreign counterintelligence, \"because it's [often] the same group of people that we're looking at.\"\n     The Minneapolis division, which includes Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota, has about 112 agents. Though no new agents have been hired to fight terrorism, the division hopes to get at least some of approximately 900 new agents the bureau expects to hire by September.\nCooperation is key\n     Morrow said that in addition to those changes, the Minneapolis Joint Terrorism Task Force, comprising federal, state and local law enforcement officers, has more than doubled in size to at least two dozen members.\n     He credited that group, which includes immigration agents, with summoning the foresight to \"grab\" Zacarias Moussaoui, the alleged 20th hijacker, who was arrested in Minnesota before the Sept. 11 attacks and is now charged with conspiring in them.\n     He was detained after behaving oddly at an Eagan flight school. Agents in Minneapolis, seeking connections to other suspected terrorists, sought a warrant to examine Moussaoui's computer, but FBI attorneys in Washington concluded there wasn't enough evidence.\n     The case shows how important it is for law enforcement agencies at all levels to know how to recognize suspected terrorists and share information about them, he said.\n     Thomas Heffelfinger, U.S. attorney for Minnesota, told the group of several dozen officers at the training that they have a grave responsibility.\n     \"This is a war that is being fought as much by law enforcement and public safety officials as it is by our military,\" Heffelfinger said.\n     Northern Minnesota \"plays a crucial and vital role\" because of the Canadian border and the international port at Duluth, he said. \"Our northern border is a porous border . . . which the terrorists have figured out and are using to their advantage,\" he said.\n     Before Sept. 11, more than 4,000 U.S. Border Patrol agents were stationed on the Mexican border and only 350 on the Canadian border, he said.\n     \"The Border Patrol has tripled that staffing since the 11th, but we still are woefully understaffed in protecting that border,\" Heffelfinger said. \"To provide that protection, we need to all work together.\"\n    _ Larry Oakes is at loakes@startribune.com.  \nCOMING UP\n     What: Regional training sessions for local law enforcement conducted by the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n     When: April 30 in Bemidji, May 9 in Marshall, May 22 in Fergus Falls, June 4 in Rochester and June 18 in St. Paul.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO\n\nLoad-Date: April 18, 2002"
