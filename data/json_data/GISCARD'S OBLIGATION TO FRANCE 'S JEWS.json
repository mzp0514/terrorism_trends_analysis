Jews the world over are united with those in France in demanding that the Government of Giscard d'Estaing thoroughly probe charges of fascist infestation of its police force and that it conduct an in-depth investigation of the current anti-Jewish violence, particularly the bombing of the Reform Rue Copernic Temple in Paris. Most important, these murderous attacks must be halted and harrassment of the Jewish community in France must cease.\nUntil these actions are taken, no Jew, anywhere, can feel secure.  FRIEDA S. LEEMON National President, Pioneer Women New York, Oct. 8, 1980\n\nGraphic\n\n \nIllustrations: drawing"
