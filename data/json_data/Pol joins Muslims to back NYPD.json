    "full text": "BACKED BY a large banner that read \"American Muslims Support NYPD,\" Rep. Pete King and a group of Muslim clerics and activists Monday praised how the NYPD conducts surveillance as part of its anti-terrorism operations.\nThe rally, held outside NYPD headquarters in lower Manhattan, was sponsored by the American Islamic Forum for Democracy. The group's founder, Dr. Zuhdi Jasser, narrated \"The Third Jihad,\" a controversial documentary that Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly was interviewed for, but later deemed \"inflammatory.\"\nJasser said he wished Kelly \"had defended that,\" but he said the bigger issue is that the department's surveillance operations were appropriate because of the ongoing threat of attacks.\n\"We are not here to criticize the NYPD,\" Jasser said, \"but rather to thank them for doing the monitoring of extremists that Muslims should be doing.\"\nJasser echoed Kelly's explanation of how the NYPD conducts surveillance, asserting that tactics like online research using publicly accessible documents and attending public meetings fall within legal guidelines.\nKing (R-Nassau), a staunch Kelly supporter, said the police focus on Muslim extremists is not different than its focus on Italians in the Mafia or the Irish in the notorious Westies gang in years past.\n\"If they were not doing what they were doing, to me they'd be negligent and remiss in their duties,\" King said.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nNLVL\n\nLoad-Date: March 7, 2012"
