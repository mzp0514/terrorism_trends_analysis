    "full text": "To the Editor:\nApparently, there has been a good deal of misunderstanding about my remarks quoted in a Sept. 8 article.\nA reporter telephoned to ask my reaction to terrorism; she did not ask for my specific reaction to the ghastly massacre in the synagogue in Istanbul, but rather my reaction to terrorism in general (or so I thought).\nWe had about a 10-minute conversation, from which one or two sentences of my remarks were quoted, to the effect that I did not condone terrorism, but felt that the reasons behind it needed to be examined and that retaliation was not enough.\nI was surprised that these remarks were taken to be insensitive by some members of the Jewish community, with which I have worked closely for at least 36 years. We have had many conferences on Jewish-Christian relations at our cathedral, we have a bay in the cathedral dedicated as a memorial to the Holocaust, and going back many years, we have a pair of menorahs on either side of the high altar given to the cathedral for the helpfulness of my predecessor, Bishop Manning, to the Jewish community.\nI abhor any mindless murder, massacre, terrorism of any kind, and I am deeply aware how this kind of persecution has been visited on the Jewish people for centuries. As a Christian, I consider myself Jewish in my religion in the sense that my roots are Jewish roots. Jesus Christ was a Jew, and we are bound together as brothers and sisters under one God.\n \n(Right Rev.) PAUL MOORE JR.\nEpiscopal Bishop of New York\n  New York, Oct. 2, 1986"
