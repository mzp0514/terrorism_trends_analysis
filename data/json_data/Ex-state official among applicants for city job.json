Michelle Lujan Grisham for less than a year. She resigned from her $156,000-a-year job with the state in November 2019 to focus on her family and health, Lindsey said in a statement to the governor at the time.\nHer abrupt resignation generated questions. It came a day after Lujan Grisham and other state officials met with Lindsey on efforts to combat potential domestic terrorism in New Mexico.\nIn her application to the city, Lindsey wrote she was \"interested in a complex and fulfilling job, which challenges and utilizes my entire skill set while making a significant difference for the health, safety and security of citizens, an organization, and ultimately, our country.\"\nThe two other applicants who made it to the interview process are also women.\nThey are Anna Blea, who has been the director of Phame Inc., a Santa Fe-based nonprofit for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, since 2007, and Annaelisa Holguin Steadman, whose position as general counsel for Pojoaque Pueblo was eliminated earlier this year.\nAmong those who applied but didn't get an interview were two current city employees: Michael Dimas, a Santa Fe native who is a sergeant with the Santa Fe Police Department, and Andrés Mercado, a longtime paramedic who oversees the city's Mobile Integrated Health Office.\nThe job posting also drew applications from a customer service representative for a local propane company and a supervisor for a Texas-based brick manufacturing company, according to documents obtained under a public records request.\nUnder the mayor's reorganization, which the City Council approved in September, the new Community Health and Safety Department encompasses police, fire, emergency management and community services.\nA job advertisement posted on the city's website showed an annual salary for the position in the range of about $102,700 to $154,000.\nFollow Daniel J.
