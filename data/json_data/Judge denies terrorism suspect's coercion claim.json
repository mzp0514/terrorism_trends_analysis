    "full text": "A federal judge in Minneapolis has declined to suppress the statements of terrorism suspect Mohamad Elzahabi, who claimed that his interview by federal agents over 17 days in 2004 amounted to coercion.\nElzahabi was charged in June 2004 in U.S. District Court with lying to federal agents about sending walkie-talkies to Pakistan, helping to get a Massachusetts driver's license for a man later convicted of plotting a bombing in Jordan and possessing fraudulent immigration documents.\nJudge John Tunheim rejected Elzahabi's coercion claim in an 18-page opinion issued Tuesday. \"The evidence shows that defendant chose to cooperate with agents because he thought he could clear his name through cooperation,\" Tunheim wrote.\n\"Defendant was clearly deceived by the officers and now understandably regrets his willingness to cooperate, but the court is convinced that defendant freely made the choice to cooperate,\" Tunheim wrote. When Elzahabi finally said he didn't want to answer any more questions, the agents promptly stopped the interview, the judge wrote.\n\"To be sure, the court is significantly troubled by the excessively long duration of the interviews here. There is a real danger that interviews that last over several days will become coercive,\" Tunheim wrote. \"However, the court finds from a careful review of the record no evidence that defendant's initial willingness to cooperate had with the passage of time degraded to the point that the interviews had become coercive.\"\n\nLoad-Date: June 6, 2007"
