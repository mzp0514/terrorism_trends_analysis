Merrill, Dawson sheriff's Lt. Tony Wooten said. The camp near Dahlonega serves as home to the 5th Ranger Training Battalion and focuses on training for small-unit mountain combat, according to globalsecurity.org.\nNo one was injured when two ground burst simulators were tossed early Sunday from a car. The military uses the explosives in place of hand grenades during training.\nWooten told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that 911 operators received a call about 1:30 a.m. Sunday from a woman who \"stated that they believe that someone threw two pipe bombs at them.\"\n\"A large group was standing around talking, and a Cadillac with three occupants pulled up, threw two devices and fled,\" Wooten said.\nHe said the Cadillac fled up Ga. 400 and deputies who were in the area and heard the explosions \"were able to see them on 400 as they attempted to turn off their lights and elude us.\"\nThe Cadillac pulled onto a side road off Ga. 400.\nDeputies later found a dozen undetonated devices they believed had been thrown from the Cadillac before it stopped, Wooten said.\nHe said investigators had not determined a motive for the incident.\n\"All we know is the opportunity was there and for whatever reason, they threw the devices at them,\" Wooten said. \"From our investigation, they don't know each other; there was no hostility; they had not done anything to each other. There was nothing to provoke it.\"\nAll three were charged with 16 counts of aggravated assault and 16 counts of reckless conduct. Morgan and Wendt also were each charged with one count of domestic terrorism and two counts of cruelty to children first degree, because two of the people in the crowd were under the age of 18, Wooten said. Wooten said Campbell also was charged with fleeing and eluding, driving with no headlights, reckless driving and one count of being a party to a crime of domestic terrorism.\nAccording to the website globalsecurity.org, the ground burst simulator is used \"to create battle noises and flash effects during training. It produces a high-pitched whistle that lasts two to four seconds. The detonation produces a flash and loud report.\"\n\"There's not a lot of shrapnel in it,\" Wooten said. \"It's basically made out of gunpowder and paper. But still, the damage from getting hit from one of those would not be pleasant.\"\n\nLoad-Date: August 10, 2010"
