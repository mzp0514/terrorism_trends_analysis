He faces life in prison. He was arrested in November 2011 after a lengthy investigation involving an undercover police officer, two confidential informants and hundreds of hours of recorded conversations.\nProsecutors say Mr. Pimentel, a Dominican native who converted to Islam, began using the name Muhammad Yusuf and maintained a website encouraging jihad against the United States. He was inspired, prosecutors say, to take action after Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical Muslim cleric, was killed in September 2011 by a drone in Yemen.\nAn indictment charges Mr. Pimentel with building one pipe bomb in an informant's apartment and beginning to build two others, using $100 in supplies from local hardware stores and supermarkets, including match heads, Christmas lights and a converted clock.\nMr. Pimentel's lawyers, Susan J. Walsh and Lori Cohen, have said they intend to argue their client was entrapped by the police. They describe him as a down-on-his-luck young man who was easily enticed by the informant to build bombs after being plied for months with free food and marijuana.\nMr. Pimentel's trial is unusual because the federal authorities typically handle terrorism prosecutions. But the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which had monitored Mr. Pimentel, decided not to pursue charges against him, and the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., has taken on the task.\nThough Mr. Pimentel was allegedly inspired by Al Qaeda propaganda, the authorities have never accused him of belonging to a larger conspiracy. Former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg even described him as a ''lone wolf'' when he was arrested.\nDeborah Hickey, an assistant district attorney, said an expert on terrorism would be needed to guide jurors through a maze of jihadist websites and organizations that Mr. Pimentel interacted with online. ''There is an arcane world in the cyber aspect of this case,'' she said, adding: ''Online activity is a big part of our case.''\nJustice Farber said he might allow a terrorism expert to testify in a limited way about definitions of words and groups, but he thought Mr. Pimentel's online postings would be self-explanatory. ''I don't think the jury needs to be told what Osama bin Laden is at this point,'' he said.\nThe judge added state law did not require prosecutors to prove Mr. Pimentel was linked to a particular group to win a conviction.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/30/nyregion/judge-limits-expert-testimony-on-terrorism-in-manhattan-bomb-case.html\n\nLoad-Date: January 30, 2014"
