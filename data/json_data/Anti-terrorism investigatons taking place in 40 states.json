    "full text": "A top FBI counterterrorism official says agents are hunting al-Qaida operatives in 40 U. S. states, but the bureau remains worried that some of the most dangerous individuals remain unknown.\nLarry Mefford, assistant FBI director for counterterrorism, said Thursday that authorities \"feel a lot more confident\" they know the identities of dozens of members of the al-Qaida terror network than they did shortly after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\"I don't want to say that we know where they all are,\" Mefford told reporters after testifying before the Senate Judiciary terrorism subcommittee.\nMefford said the investigations in 40 states run \"the whole gamut\" from people positively identified as al-Qaida operatives to uncorroborated tips from citizens.\n\"We know this: The al-Qaida terrorist network remains the most serious threat to U.S. interests both at home and overseas,\" Mefford told the panel. \"That network includes groups committed to the international jihad movement and it has demonstrated the ability to survive setbacks.\"\nAsked if he believed such a sleeper cell could be poised for a new attack on the scale of Sept. 11, Mefford said, \"Not that I'm aware of.\"\nThe FBI has had greater success in finding people suspected of providing logistical or recruiting help to al-Qaida. Mefford cited as an example last week's guilty plea by Ohio trucker Iyman Faris, who admitted to conducting surveillance for a possible attack on the Brooklyn Bridge and plotting to derail trains.\n\nLoad-Date: June 29, 2003"
