OklahomaIt is a result of a collaborative research and education program of the Oklahoma City National Memorial, OU, the University of Tulsa and Oklahoma State University.\nJoseph Ginat, visiting professor and former adviser on Arab affairs to former Israeli Prime Minister Itzhak Rabin, will sit on the four-person panel at the symposium. The anniversary of the bombing is Monday.\nLisa Moreno-Hix, director of the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, said the symposium is about the terrorist mind-set.\n\"There is a strong interest of survivors, family members and rescuers about the roots of terrorism,\" Moreno-Hix said. \"Our belief is that one of the first steps in preventing is knowing what causes this and the terrorist mind-set.\"\nGinat interviewed convicted Islamic jihad suicide bombers in Israel a year and a half ago for a documentary film. He said the type of terrorism in these cases is different from other terrorist activities.\n\"There is a new dimension of suicide attacks,\" Ginat said. \"This is a new phenomenon and is difficult to handle. If someone comes to commit suicide and take out as many people as they can, it is difficult to avoid.\"\n(C) 1999 Oklahoma Daily via U-WIRE\n\nLoad-Date: April 16, 1999"
