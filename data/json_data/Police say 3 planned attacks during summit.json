Lauderdale, Fla.; Jared Chase, 24, of Keene, N.H.; and, Brent Vincent Betterly, 24, of Oakland Park, Fla.\nIf convicted on all counts — conspiracy to commit terrorism, material support for terrorism and possession of explosives — the men could get up to 85 years in prison.\nOutside the courtroom, Duetsch said the two undercover police officers or informants were also arrested during the Wednesday raid, and defense attorneys later lost track of the two.\n\"We believe this is all a setup and entrapment to the highest degree,\" Duetsch said.\nThe suspects were each being held on $1.5 million bond. Six others arrested Wednesday in the raid were released Friday without being charged.\nThe three who remained in custody apparently came to Chicago late last month to take part in May Day protests. Relatives and acquaintances said the men were wanderers who bounced around as part of the Occupy movement and had driven together from Florida to Chicago, staying with other activists.\nCourt records indicated no prior violent behavior.\nLongtime observers of police tactics said the operation seemed similar to those conducted by authorities in other cities before similarly high-profile events.\nFor instance, prior to the Republican National Convention in 2008 in St. Paul, Minn., prosecutors charged eight activists who were organizing mass protests with terrorism-related crimes after investigators said they recovered equipment for Molotov cocktails, slingshots with marbles and other items.\nThe protesters, who became known as the RNC Eight, denied the allegations and accused authorities of stifling dissent. The terrorism charges were later dismissed. Five of the suspects eventually pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges, and three had their cases dismissed altogether.\nMolotov cocktails are dangerous weapons, but it \"kind of stretches the bounds to define that as terrorism,\" said Michael Scott, director of the Center for Problem-Oriented Policing at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\nHe said police have a history of abusing such tactics, sometimes infiltrating purely peaceful protest groups to search for troublemakers.\nBut if the allegations are true, police were justified in moving quickly to take the men off the streets, even if the terrorism charges don't stick.\nJust one week before their arrest, at least two of the suspects were involved in a minor confrontation with police captured on a video that was then posted on YouTube and aired widely by Chicago media, said another defense attorney, Sarah Gelsomino.\nDocuments filed by prosecutors in support of the charges in Chicago painted an ominous portrait of the men, saying the trio also discussed using swords, hunting bows and knives with brass-knuckle handles in their attacks.\nRelatives and acquaintances painted a starkly different picture.\nActivist Bill Vassilakis, who said he let the men stay in his apartment, described Betterly as an industrial electrician who had volunteered to help with wiring at The Plant, a former meatpacking facility that has been turned into a food incubator with the city's backing.\n\"All I can say about that is, if you knew Brent, you would find that to be the most ridiculous thing you've ever heard. He was the most stand-up guy that was staying with me. He and the other guys had done nothing but volunteer their time and energy,\" he said.\nChase's aunt, Barbara Chase of Westmoreland, N.H. said she was stunned to learn of the charges against her nephew.\n\"That surprised me because he's not that dumb,\" she said. \"He always seemed harmless, but who knows? \"\nOutside influences sometimes can sway people to do things that they normally wouldn't do.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \nBrian Church Brent Vincent Betterly Jared Chase\n\nLoad-Date: May 21, 2012"
