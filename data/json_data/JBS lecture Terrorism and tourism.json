    "full text": "April 24--Terrorists don't like tourism because the industry promotes women, embraces difference and generates a lot of revenue, all things terrorists decry, according to Peter Tarlow, president of Tourism & Moore and director of the center for Latino-Jewish Relations.\nTarlow was the speaker at the John Ben Shepperd Public Leadership Institute's Leadership Roundup at the University of Texas of the Permian Basin Library Lecture Hall Thursday evening. Moderated by Robert Brescia, executive director of the JBS Public Leadership Institute, the topic was \"Terrorism: How It Will Affect Your Future.\" About 40 people attended.\nA rabbi who earned a Ph.D. in sociology from Texas A&M University and holds degrees in history, Spanish and Hebrew literatures and psychotherapy, Tarlow said he thinks the world is moving toward a high point in terrorism.\nHe has heard that ISIS has set up on the border with Mexico, although he does not know if it's true.\n\"ISIS is more powerful than we think,\" he said, and it's attractive to westerners disillusioned with the culture.\nHe also urged those attending to become more informed and get their information from multiple sources because no one has the full story by themselves.\nRuth Campbell covers education for the Odessa American.
