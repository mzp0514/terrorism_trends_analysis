He arrested Heriberto (Eddie) Seda during a tense hostage standoff in 1996, then recognized Seda's handwriting as the serial killer's when he saw a confession signed with an upside-down cross.\n\"A very calm feeling came over me, a very calm sensation, because I knew we had him, but I knew there was a lot of work to do yet,\" he said of building the case.\nHerbert, who was tapped to lead the Joint Terrorism Task Force in 2014, on Tuesday offered this advice new police recruits looking to make their marks:\n\"Take pride in your job. Take pride in what you do. Document as much as you can, whether in your memo book, on the summons . . . If you go the court, and you tell the district attorney you'll do something, or if the district attorney asks you to do something, do it.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \nNYPD Deputy Chief Joe Herbert - who caught the 1990s Zodiac killer - gets a retirement sendoff Wednesday with a vintage Tommy gun and a ride in a '70s squad car.
