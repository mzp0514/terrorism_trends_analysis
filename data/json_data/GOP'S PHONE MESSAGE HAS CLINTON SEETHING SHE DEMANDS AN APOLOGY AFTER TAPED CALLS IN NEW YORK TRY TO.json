    "full text": "Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton said yesterday she was \"outraged\" that New York Republicans had linked her to the terrorist bombing of the USS Cole in phone calls to New York voters.\n\"I believe the Republican Party and Congressman Lazio owe an apology to the families of the sailors who died in the terrorist bombing of the USS Cole,\" she said.\nClinton called the phone calls \"unacceptable,\" adding, \"Everyone should be condemning it.\" The Oct. 12 blast killed 17 U.S. sailors and injured 39.\nU.S. Rep. Rick Lazio, her opponent in the New York Senate race, and the state GOP refused to apologize for anything. State party officials, with the election now 10 days away, promised the calls would continue.\nLazio charged that Clinton had hidden a $1,000 donation from a supporter of the Palestinian group Hamas, listing it as coming from the \"American Museum Council\" instead of its real name, the American Muslim Council.\n\"That's the real story here,\" Lazio said.\n\"We don't need any advice from [top adviser] Harold Ickes and Hillary Clinton on how to run campaigns in New York - people who are now forced to return $50,000 to people who associate themselves with terrorism and violence in the Middle East,\" Lazio added.\nThe Clinton campaign has said the Museum/Muslim discrepancy was simply a typographical error. But Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson said Lazio's charge was a smoke screen to cover his role in the GOP phone calls.\n\"Congressman Lazio will say anything to avoid taking responsibility for these phone calls,\" Wolfson said. \"Instead of more insults and finger-pointing, he should apologize to the families of the murdered sailors and stop the calls.\"\nLazio, who was to receive the endorsement of the New York Post today, spoke after a rally at West Babylon Junior High School with Gov. George Pataki and a pair of Long Island GOP congressional candidates. Clinton made her comments as she arrived in Ithaca to begin a three-day bus trip across upstate New York.\nSetting her off were newspaper reports yesterday that the New York State Republican Committee had started calling voters to talk about Clinton's links to Palestinian and Arab American groups - and by extension, to terrorists.\nIn the message, voters are told that Clinton accepted money from an Arab organization that \"openly brags about its support for a Mideast terrorism group, the same kind of terrorism that killed our sailors on the USS Cole.\"\nLast week, the Clinton campaign returned $50,000 that came from a Boston fund-raiser sponsored by a group that supports the Palestinian organization Hamas.\nThe Clinton campaign denied knowing that the group was involved with the fund-raising event.\n\"We're not apologizing,\" said Dan Allen, spokesman for the state Republicans. \"She's the one who ought to be apologizing. . . . She's been taking money from groups that support terrorism.\"\n\nLoad-Date: February 5, 2002"
