    "full text": "To the Editor:\n The dangerous consequences of enacting broad antiterrorism legislation, discussed in a June 6 news article, are illustrated by a recent episode involving the State Department's Office for Combating Terrorism.\nIn March 1983, this little-known office published a list of organizations around the world that had engaged in the seizure of hostages.\nOn the list was a Paraguayan group, the Popular Colorado Movement (Mopoco).\nNobody seems to have paid much attention until this February, when Paraguay's Minister of the Interior cited the list as ''proof'' that Mopoco was an extremist group. Mopoco members were placed under close surveillance, and Paraguay's leading newspaper, ABC Color, was shut down, and its editor was jailed for a time, after the newspaper carried an interview with a leader of Mopoco.\nThe U.S. Embassy in Paraguay, which has done good work on human rights, was apparently embarrassed by this incident. Neither it nor the State Department could cite any evidence to support the listing of Mopoco as a terrorist group. It is, so far as anyone is aware, entirely peaceful.\nMopoco has now been removed from the list, and the embassy has made this known in Paraguay. Even so, enormous damage has been done. For example, ABC Color remains closed.\nThe absence of procedural safeguards in determining which groups to list as terrorist made the U.S. do damage to human rights in Paraguay. The legislation proposed by the Reagan Administration would extend the damage by subjecting Americans to criminal penalties for aiding groups that may be as peaceful as Mopoco.\nAside from rejecting any such proposal, Congress should inquire how the Office for Combating Terrorism goes about listing groups as terrorist.\n \nARYEH NEIER\nVice Chairman, Americas Watch New York, June 6, 1984"
