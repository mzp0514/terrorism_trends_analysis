    "full text": "The top two Republicans in the Maryland Senate will not seek reelection to their leadership posts.\nSens. J.B Jennings and Steve Hershey, the minority party leader and whip, respectively, made the announcement late Tuesday night. The pair were facing a challenge in an election scheduled for Saturday.\nSen. Michael Hough, R-Frederick, was named a likely challenge Hershey for his position. Later, Sen. Bryan Simonaire, R-Anne Arundel, emerged as a potential challenger to Jennings.\nJennings and Hershey have led the caucus since 2014 and 2015, respectively, and are liked both within their party and by Democratic senators.\nSome are now questioning whether changes in the Senate’s politics require adjustments after six years.\nHershey moved front and center for some who felt that a number of messages posted to social media  primarily his Twitter account  placed Republican senators from competitive districts in politically difficult positions.\nFor instance, he pushed back hard when President Trump flirted with the notion of delaying the Nov. 3 election because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n“For anyone sitting on the sidelines who won’t speak loudly, I’ll say it again for those in the back: We aren’t delaying our November election. It is an absurd notion, an unAmerican suggestion and one that every Republican colleague of mine should disavow, without hesitation,” Hersey posted on Twitter in a message.\nSome Maryland Republicans said Hershey’s response potentially put Republicans in competitive districts in Anne Arundel, Baltimore and Harford counties in a difficult position. Other said the message wasn’t intended to spotlight members of the Maryland Senate.\nHersheywas also criticized by some for messages on Twitter following a mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, an incident he called an incident of white nationalist terrorism.\n(This story will be updated.)\nCopyright © 2020 BridgeTower Media.
