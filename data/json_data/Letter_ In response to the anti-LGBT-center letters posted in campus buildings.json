    "full text": "I am a major supporter of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, and being in a serious same-sex relationship, I found this very demoralizing and a step back for the UNI community.\nI know that teachers and students were taking them down but one person's closed-minded thoughts have disrupted an entire community here on campus.\nI just found it very offensive and hurtful that someone on campus would have such strong feelings toward the LGBT. We are just trying to have real relationships with people without being looked down on by society. These accusations reflect some of the same ideas that Adolf Hitler used to begin his terrorism on LGBT individuals.\nI just felt very attacked One of my good friends had this to say about the letter: \"'The LGBT cry equality and plaster their crap everywhere... make it uncomfortable for the rest of us'? Don't BASIC and (the) Navigators do the same as well? Who is this person calling a hypocrite?\"\nWe do not write offensive letters about BASIC and the Navigators, and we are not forcing anyone to be gay and turn the entire campus into a LGBT party. We just want to let people know that there is a safe space available for people who are confused and need someone to talk to about their feelings.\nJessica Kray\nSophomore, theatre\n \n\nLoad-Date: June 4, 2014"
