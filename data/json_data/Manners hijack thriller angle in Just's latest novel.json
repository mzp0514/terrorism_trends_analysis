    "full text": "Two years ago, novelist Ward Just produced \"An Unfinished Season,\" ostensibly a coming-of-age novel but actually a novel of manners. Now, the author gives us \"Forgetfulness.\" Ostensibly, it's a terrorism thriller. But once again, it's actually a novel of manners -- and once again, it's a good one.\nAt the center of the tale stands Thomas Railles, an American painter who lives with his French wife in a village on the French side of the Pyrenees. One evening, his wife goes for a stroll. She never returns.\nHer murder was the work of four shady North Africans; French authorities eventually arrest them. Because two of Railles' boyhood chums work for the CIA and because he did a bit of work for them in the past, he gets to sit in on the interrogation -- even to become part of the interrogation.\nA plot summary makes \"Forgetfulness\" sound juicier than it is. The terrorism angle is vague and unresolved. That judgment isn't meant as a slam against the novel, because it isn't about terrorism. It's about Railles, a man in his mid-60s, left to cope with life all by himself.\nAs the book progresses, Railles must turn his keen artist's eye inward on his soul as he deals with a changed world in which people fidget with something called a BlackBerry.\nIf you're turned off by novels of manners, you'll find \"Forgetfulness\" a tedious tale that goes nowhere. But if you appreciate introspection and lovely writing, you'll find \"Forgetfulness\" hard to put down and Thomas Railles impossible to forget.\nJust's fans -- and I'm among them -- will know what I mean.\n---\n'Forgetfulness'\nA novel by Ward Just Published by Houghton Mifflin 272 pages, $25\n\nNotes\n\n Books \n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO\n PHOTO - (Book cover: 'Forgetfulness' by Ward Just) \n\nLoad-Date: October 9, 2006"
