Faris said the group wanted to use the aircraft as an \"escape airplane,\" according to the court papers.\nWhile Faris is considered a low-level al-Qaeda operative, authorities believe he received orders from senior lieutenants such as Mohammed, who is in U.S. custody overseas. Intelligence that Mohammed has provided is proving valuable to federal law enforcement officials as they work to disrupt possible further attacks, according to Justice Department officials.\nMohammed was not named in court papers, but his identity was confirmed by a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\nFaris pleaded guilty May 1 to two charges: providing material support to a terrorist group and conspiracy to provide such support. The plea was kept sealed because of national security concerns, Ashcroft said.\nThe plea was unsealed yesterday in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va. As part of the deal, Faris must cooperate with federal authorities.\nFaris, who is represented by a lawyer and said in the documents he was not coerced to plead, could face 20 years in prison and up to $500,000 in fines. Sentencing was set for Aug. 1.\nAshcroft and FBI officials would not detail the circumstances of Faris' arrest. They also would not say whether Faris was part of an active al-Qaeda cell in the United States, or whether he had previously been monitored.\n\"Al-Qaeda knew that Faris, wrapped in the cloak of American citizenship and protected by the liberties of our republic, could travel unfettered from country to country, state to state, city to city,\" the attorney general said.\nFaris appeared to be just another truck driver crisscrossing the country.\nThe affidavit gave this account of his actions:\nBorn in Kashmir, a disputed region claimed by both India and Pakistan, Faris came to the United States in 1994 and became a citizen in December 1999. About a year later, he traveled to Afghanistan with a conspirator who was not identified in court papers. Faris said he had known his travel companion since the Soviet war with Afghanistan in the 1980s. He referred to him as bin Laden's \"right foot,\" meaning he held a key leadership role in al-Qaeda.\nFaris met bin Laden in late 2000 at an al-Qaeda training camp. Soon afterward, he began to help the terrorist group by procuring cash and supplies.\nIn early 2002, Faris met with Mohammed and described how he made deliveries to airport cargo planes as part of his job as a truck driver. Faris said Mohammed told him he was interested in the planes because they would \"hold more weight and fuel.\"\nAt that same meeting, Faris said he was told of plans for new attacks on New York and Washington.\nFaris was asked to help by finding equipment capable of burning through the suspension cables of the Brooklyn Bridge and tools able to derail trains. He was instructed to refer to the items in code as \"gas stations\" and \"mechanics shops.\"\nIn late 2002, Faris cased the Brooklyn Bridge. He said his trip convinced him that an attack would fail because of the bridge's structure and heightened security.\nHe sent his al-Qaeda colleagues a coded message that the bridge plan should be aborted.\nSince the Sept. 11 attacks, the government has obtained guilty pleas from several members of alleged al-Qaeda sleeper cells in the United States. Six men in Lackawanna, N.Y., have pleaded guilty to terrorism-related charges.\nContact reporter Shannon McCaffrey at 202-383-6164 or smccaffrey@krwashington.com.  \nThis article contains information from the Associated Press.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO;\nIyman Faris said his possible terrorist targets included the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nLoad-Date: August 1, 2005"
