    "full text": "Chris Budzisz told community members Thursday night that the United States must try to understand who our enemy is in the war against terrorism.\nBudzisz, a professor of political science at Loras College, was one of eight panelists at a forum titled \"Living in Safety â€¦ Not in Fear: Our Community's Response to Terrorism\" in the Dubuque Senior High School auditorium. Other panelists included representatives from the Department of Health, the Telegraph Herald, Dubuque Community Schools, law enforcement, emergency-management services, the American Red Cross and the Gannon Center for Community Mental Health. About 40 people attended the event, which was sponsored by Northeast Iowa Community College.\nThe forum was an opportunity for the representatives to address safety measures and answer questions from the community in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\nBudzisz was asked to speak on the Muslim/Islam perspective. Budzisz said he had some reservations when asked to be a part of the forum, since he is not a Muslim. However, he felt it was necessary to educate others about the political, social and economic conditions in the Arab world.\n\"I don't think we should rationalize the events, but we should and must try to understand who we're dealing with, what we're dealing with,\" he said.\nAccording to Budzisz, there is a lack of understanding of the Islamic religion. Islam, like Judaism and Christianity, is a monotheistic religion.\n\"The same God Islamic people pray to five times a day is the same God of Jesus and Moses,\" he said. The main difference is that Muslims believe Jesus is only a prophet and not the son of God, he added.\nWhile there is nothing in the Quran, the holy book of Islam, that instructs people to hurt innocent people, Budzisz said some have used religion to back up what was done on Sept. 11.\nThe professor said many people have asked him why Arabs hate Americans. Although he said that is not the case, he added that \"there is some serious anti-American sentiment in certain areas.\"\nThis attitude stems from a number of things, including the conflict between Palestine and Israel. Many Arabs believe the United States is favoring Israel too much, Budzisz said. Afghanistan also is a very poor country, which makes for a breeding ground for hatred. Unfortunately, America is a good target for that hate, according to Budzisz.\nWhen dealing with terrorism, he said the United States should not just focus on military action as an option.\n\"Be very mindful of the political and economic conditions that are in that part of the world,\" Budzisz told the crowd.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nChris Budzisz, a Loras College professor, speaks during a forum about responding to terrorism at Dubuque Senior High School Thursday.
