The object is to ensure that Tidewater operations are in compliance with new Coast Guard post-9/11guidelines.\nTidewater has hired Corporate Security Services of Vancouver (www. corpsecure. com) to conduct the study of Tidewater's on-board operations and terminals in Vancouver; Boardman, Ore.; Pasco; and Wilma, near Clarkston.\nFor example, Frasher said, Corporate Security Services will determine if the terminals are secure and how well the employees are trained to watch for and prevent various terrorism-related situations.\nJohn Posey, president of Corporate Security Services, said his firm's clients also include Alaska Airlines, Kaiser Permanente, the Bonneville Power Administration and Nortel Networks.\n\nLoad-Date: June 27, 2003"
