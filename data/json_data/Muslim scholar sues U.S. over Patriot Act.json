    "full text": "NEW YORK - A leading Muslim scholar who opposes the war in Iraq has sued the U.S. government, claiming officials used anti-terrorism laws to stop him from accepting speaking invitations from organizations.\nIn a federal lawsuit filed Wednesday, Tariq Ramadan accuses the government of manipulating the Patriot Act to muzzle him. In a phone interview with The Associated Press, the Swiss intellectual and Muslim scholar denied that he supports terrorism.\n\"I have no connections to terrorism,\" Ramadan said from Oxford, England, where he is a visiting fellow. \"This is all about my political thoughts. And my political thoughts are known to everyone.\"\nRamadan was blocked from accepting a tenured teaching position at the University of Notre Dame when his visa was revoked in August 2004 under a provision of the Patriot Act, said Jameel Jaffer, an ACLU staff attorney.\nJaffer said the provision denies entry into the U.S. by any prominent foreigner who has used his status to endorse or espouse terrorism or to persuade others to do so.\nRamadan, 43, said he opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq, and sympathizes with the resistance there and in Palestine. But he said he also opposes Islamic extremism, and promotes peaceful solutions.\n\nLoad-Date: January 27, 2006"
