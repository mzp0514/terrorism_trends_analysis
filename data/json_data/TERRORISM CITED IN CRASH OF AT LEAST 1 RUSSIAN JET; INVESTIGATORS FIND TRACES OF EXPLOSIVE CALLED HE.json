All 46 passengers and crew were killed.\nAnother airliner bound for Volgograd that took off from the same airport 55 minutes later crashed about the same time 120 miles south of Moscow, killing all 44 people aboard. Tests were under way to determine whether any trace of explosives could be found in the wreckage of the Volgograd-bound airliner, Zakharov said.\n He said the FSB, the successor agency to the Soviet-era KGB, has developed a list of suspects in the Sibir crash. \"We have determined persons who might be involved in this terrorist act,\" he said.\n White House spokesman Scott McClellan said evidence was growing that both air disasters were \"acts of terrorism.\"\n The discovery of bomb-making material at one of the crash sites deepened fears among Russians that the disasters were not a tragic coincidence, as Russian officials initially theorized, but a highly coordinated terrorist attack. It also heightened concern that Russia's decade-long conflict with separatists in the mostly Islamic republic of Chechnya was again wreaking havoc well outside the tiny southern province's borders.\n Those worries were bolstered by an Islamic militant group's claim on a Muslim web site that its fighters had hijacked both airliners in retaliation for the deaths of Chechen Muslims. Calling itself the Islambouli Brigades, the group said: \"Muslims are being killed by Russian soldiers in Chechnya, and this will stop only if we wage war with Russians. Our Mujahideen managed to strike the first blow, which will be followed by a series of other operations.\"\n Islam experts say several Muslim extremist groups invoke the name of Lt. Khaled Islambouli, who led a 1981 ambush that assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. Last month, a group calling itself the Islambouli Brigades of al-Qaida claimed responsibility for an attempt to kill Pakistan's prime minister-designate.\n There was no way to verify the group's claim, and Russian FSB officials declined comment on the Web site statement.\n Meanwhile, Russian officials said they were focusing attention on two Chechen women who were passengers on the downed flights. Russian investigators said they were investigating the women in part because no relatives of either woman contacted authorities after the crashes.\n One woman, described by investigators as Amanta Nagayeva, bought a ticket for the Volgograd-bound flight only an hour before takeoff, Russian television reported. The other, identified by officials only as S. Dzhebirkhanova, was a passenger on the Sibir flight bound for the Black Sea resort of Sochi.\n Chechen rebels have increasingly relied on female suicide bombers to unleash terrorist attacks throughout southern Russia and in Moscow. Such women, often the widows or relatives of dead Chechen fighters, have been involved in the 2002 theater takeover in Moscow that killed 129 people as well as a suicide bomb attack at a Moscow rock concert last year that killed 15.\n The Russian media and several Chechen affairs experts have speculated that the airliner crashes were terrorist attacks aimed at casting a pall over tomorrow's presidential election in Chechnya, a contest that a pro-Kremlin candidate is expected to win.\n\nLoad-Date: August 30, 2004"
