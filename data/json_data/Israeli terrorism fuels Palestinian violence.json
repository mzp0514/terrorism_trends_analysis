    "full text": "The first comparison an Israeli supporter will say about the conflict in the West Bank is that it is equivalent to the United State's hunt for bin Laden.\nThe sure thing is that the Israeli army has made an Afghanistan out of the West Bank towns and refugee camps. As Israeli Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer addressed the Knesset, \"Whoever thinks the Israeli Defense Forces operations can stop terrorism is mistaken.\"\nVirginia Tech\nThe sieges of Arab cities in the West Bank are an act of desperation by Sharon's government, critically needed to show Israeli citizens some sort of response to Arab attacks.\nHis government's strategies to invade cities and round up Arab men between 18 and 60 years old in search of terrorists have proven fruitless.\nIt has been in action for months and violence has just reached its highest point.\nArafat has been sealed off from the world, and in the week he has been caged, there have been six suicide missions against Israel -- a surge in attacks.\nAlthough Israel prefers to put the blame of Arab violence solely on him, it will not admit that this violence is a reaction from people filled with utter desperation and helplessness in the face of Israeli terrorism and aggression.\nPeace will come with justice. The United Nations in 1967 passed Resolution 242 calling on Israel to end its occupation of the West Bank, among other crucial issues.\nAlthough the whole world agreed with it, Palestinians are still waiting for this to be enacted.\nAs long as America continues to hold Israel without blame for its actions and sponsor them with billions of dollars and high-tech weaponry, Israel will never feel the need to account for what the world deems as justice.\nUntil Israel abides by international law, violence and armed resistance will continue.\n(C) 2002 The Collegiate Times via U-WIRE\n\nLoad-Date: April 10, 2002"
