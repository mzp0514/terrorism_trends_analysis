    "full text": "WASHINGTON -- President Clinton's top foreign policy advisers\nare considering how the government should respond to increasing\nconcerns about the prospect of terrorism related to celebrations\nfor the new millennium.\nDuring a two-hour discussion Monday at the White House, advisers\nincluding Attorney General Janet Reno, Secretary of State Madeleine\nAlbright and CIA Director George Tenet discussed whether the government\nshould issue further guidance to the public beyond a warning on\nDec. 11 to Americans traveling overseas during the holidays.\nAdministration officials said that an additional statement could\ncome as soon as today, but the form and content of the new statement\nwas still unclear late Monday.\nConcern about millennium-related violence has heightened in the\nUSA after last week's arrest of alleged Algerian terrorist Ahmed\nRessam.\nThe 32-year-old Montreal resident was charged Friday with transporting\na carload of powerful explosives, including two jars of nitroglycerine,\ninto Washington state from Canada.\nAuthorities were also seeking more information on a possible accomplice.\nThe discovery of bomb-making materials prompted a renewed focus\non porous U.S. border crossings in the Northwest as law enforcement\nofficials prepared to deal with the potential for violence related\nto upcoming observances of the next millennium across the country.\nDespite Ressam's arrest and seizure of bomb-making materials,\nfederal law enforcement officials reasserted Monday that they\nwere not aware of any specific targets for violence.\nWhite House spokesman Joe Lockhart said President Clinton was\nreceiving updates on the terrorist situation. Clinton, however,\nwas not present during the meeting of his advisers.\nU.S. officials denied some published reports indicating that the\nClinton administration feels Canada's counterterrorism efforts\nhave been lacking.\n\"We have a lot of confidence in the ability of our Canadian friends\nto undertake effective counterterrorist work and effective law\nenforcement work,\" State Department spokesman James Foley said.\nConcerns about the safety of U.S. facilities and Americans abroad\ncontinue at the State Department after its worldwide travel alert\nwas issued more than a week ago.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration said the circumstances of\nRessam's arrest also have caused the agency to tightened security\nmeasures at U.S. airports. Travelers are expected to encounter\nmore explosive-detection teams and uniformed police patrolling\ninside and outside airports, officials said.\n Contributing: Barbara Slavin, Lawrence McQuillan and Blake Morrison\n\nLoad-Date: December 21, 1999"
