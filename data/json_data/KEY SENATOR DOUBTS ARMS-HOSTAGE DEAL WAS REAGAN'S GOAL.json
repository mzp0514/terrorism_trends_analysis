    "full text": "Senator David Boren, the new Democratic chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said here today that he believed President Reagan did not intend to trade arms to Iran for hostages.\nBut he said that, because of ''political pressure,'' the Administration had become obsessed with obtaining the hostages' release.\nAnd this, he added, resulted in serious damage to the nation's policy on terrorism.\nHe spoke at a conference on terrorism, sponsored by Time magazine.\nThe question of whether the Iranian arms deal was in fact a straight trade of arms for hostages or was part of a broader foreign policy initiative, as President Reagan has said, remains one of the central unanswered questions in the affair.\nSenator Boren, who is from Oklahoma, said he based his evaluation on secret testimony and evidence given to the Intelligence Committee in its investigation of the sale of arms to Iran and the apparent diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.\nHe said the principal lesson was that the Government should resist elevating terrorist incidents such as hostage-taking into a major national concern.\n''If we blow terrorist acts out of proportion, if we allow every terrorist act to divert our attention, then the terrorists will have won,'' he said. ''As a result of building a national crisis atmosphere, the major policy interests of this country and the long-range policy interests of the fight against terrorism have been severely damaged.''\nMr. Boren also said that, because the policies on terrorism had been damaged, more hostages could be seized."
