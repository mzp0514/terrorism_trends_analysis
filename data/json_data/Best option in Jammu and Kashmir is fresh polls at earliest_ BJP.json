    "full text": "New Delhi, Nov. 21 -- The BJP Wednesday said the best option in Jammu and Kashmir is to have fresh assembly polls at the earliest as it slammed the proposed alliance of opposition parties as a \"combination of terror-friendly parties\".\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said on Twitter, soon after the state governor dissolved the assembly amid claims by rival formations on forming a government, that the border state cannot afford horse-trading and instability keeping its security scenario in mind. \"The proposed alliance between the Congress and the PDP broke up even before it was formed. They have taken contradictory positions on dissolution. One supports it and the other opposes it,\" the BJP said.\n\"The best option in such a scenario is to go in for a fresh election at the earliest. This assembly cannot produce a stable government,\" it added.\nJammu and Kashmir needs a firm administration to deal with terrorism and not a combination of terror-friendly parties, it added.\nThe Jammu and Kashmir assembly was abruptly dissolved by the Governor Wednesday night hours after the PDP staked claim to form a government with the backing of rival National Conference and the Congress followed by another bid from the two-member People's Conference which claimed the support of the BJP and 18 legislators from other parties.\nThe dissolution was announced by Governor Satyapal Malik in a communique released by the Raj Bhavan.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MetroVaartha English.
