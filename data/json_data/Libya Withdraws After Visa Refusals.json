    "full text": "Libya withdrew from the Olympic Games today, a day after the State Department refused to grant visas to three Libyans accredited to the Olympics as journalists.\nThe Associated Press quoted unidentified sources in the International Olympic Committee as saying that two of the Libyans were on a secret list of known terrorists compiled by anti-terrorist groups in Western nations.\nJuan Antonio Samaranch of Spain, the I.O.C. president, disagreed with the terrorist theory.\n''The information is not right,'' he told a news conference.\nIn Washington, the State Department would not comment. ''I am not at liberty to discuss the details or the nature of the information,'' said John Campbell, a State Department spokesman.\nThe United States, which has no diplomatic relations with Libya, has said that Col. Muammar Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, is a supporter of international terrorism.\nI.O.C. rules require the host nation of an Olympics to grant automatic entry to all athletes and officials. There is no such requirement for journalists. Earlier in the week, Samaranch said the I.O.C. would attempt to change that.\n''We have to improve this in our charter,'' he said, ''and we will do it.''\nLibya's team consisted of one weight lifter, five equestrians and eight officials. Of the athletes, only the weight lifter was here.\nThe announcement of Libya's withdrawal was made by the Libyan radio in Tripoli, the capital. Peter V. Ueberroth, president of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee, said, however, that he had no official word of the withdrawal. He said Libyan officials here wanted to talk with him, and he said he hoped the Libyan lifter would take part in the opening ceremonies."
