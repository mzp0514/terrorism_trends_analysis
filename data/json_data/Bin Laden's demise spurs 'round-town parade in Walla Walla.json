Veterans also placed U.S. flags throughout downtown to mark the blow against terrorism.\nAmong those taking part in the noon-hour parade was Danny Lackey, a recently retired Air National Guard member who had served in the United Arab Emirates.\n\"It was a great retirement gift,\" Lackey said about the news of bin Laden's death as he joined others gathering for the event at the city's main fire station on Poplar Street.\nLarry Cunnington, a member of AMVETS Post 1111 who was distributing personal-sized U.S. flags to participants, said he felt bin Laden's death should have come \"a long time ago\" instead of nearly a decade after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. But others made it clear that the Sunday raid by U.S. Navy SEALs was welcome no matter what the date.\nThe parade started at the main fire station and headed along Main Street to Isaacs Avenue, then along Wilbur Avenue, Alder Street and finally back along Poplar Street to its starting point.\nAlong the way, participants drew a mix of cheers, shouts of approval and waves.\nBut others were puzzled by the celebration and questioned whether it was appropriate.\n\"OH WOW! I had NO idea this was going on today! I don't think that this is something we should be celebrating in this way!\" wrote one person on the Union-Bulletin's Facebook page. \"I am glad he is dead and can't hurt anyone else. I'm sure terrorism isn't over, but killing him sent a loud message that we don't just let it go. Standing for what is right and never giving up is what America is about; not having a party and rejoicing our blood-stained hands! Justice is served and I hope OBL rots in hell. But, we shouldn't be acting like this!\"\nAnother person wrote \"I'm a little torn on this one. Celebrating someone's death? Hmm... Celebrating a possible turning point in the war on terror, but celebrating murder... I think we oughta be preparing for the retaliation that's probably already in the works from the rest of (al-Qaida)! He was one man, an evil one for sure, but there are hundreds out there ready to take his place.\"\nAndy Porter can be reached at andyporter@wwub.com or 526-8318.\nTo see more of the Union-Bulletin or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.union-bulletin.com/.
