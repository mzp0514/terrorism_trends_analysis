    "full text": "NBC News has won the battle! Or has it?\nThe controversy at NBC concerning the airing of ''Special Bulletin,'' a provocative Entertainment Division drama about terrorism in Charleston, S.C., which uses a simulated news format (Sunday, 9 to 11 p.m.), has been resolved by top NBC brass. NBC News president Reuven Frank objected because he felt some viewers might believe the fictional event was really happening, a la Orson Welles's infamous ''War of the Worlds'' broadcast in 1939. NBC Entertainment felt too many disclaimers would have a negative impact upon the show.\nNBC released the following statement Thursday: ''The only concern of NBC News was that 'Special Bulletin' might have been confused with a news program. We agreed on various steps to ensure that the average viewer will not be misled in that way.''\nWhat will be done? According to Monitor TV critic Arthur Unger:\n* NBC is increasing the number of times the following visual advisory will be shown on screen: ''The following program is a realistic depiction of fictional events. None of what you are about to see is actually happening.'' This message will also be read by an announcer.\n* There will be an increase in the number of messages that identify the drama as a ''Movie of the Week.''\n* The words ''a dramatization'' will be superimposed on screen during the climactic portions of the program.\nPerhaps most important, the regularly scheduled ''NBC News Capsule'' that usually airs on Sundays between 9 and 11 p.m. will be eliminated for this week only.\nSo while NBC News appears to have won the battle, Entertainment really has the last word: The show itself is a strong indictment of the way network news handles events such as blackmail threats by terrorists."
