Though the country is 90 percent Muslim, religious tension crackles below a facade of political stability.\nAt Cairo University where Farag recently landed a faculty position in oral medicine, some professors won't discuss politics openly because they know thousands of Muslim intellectuals and dissidents have been dragged from their homes and imprisoned.\nThe Muslim Brotherhood, linked in the past with radical revolt, is officially banned. Still, it is alive and active - widely respected for moral leadership through its medical clinics for the poor and other community service. A few prominent \"brothers\" have won seats in parliament by running under the banners of legal parties, but many hide their affiliation.\n\"You cannot count the number of brothers, but you can be sure they are a significant power in this country where they are supposedly forbidden,\" said one sympathizer.\nIt is in that context of political intrigue that Egyptians process the notion of American-style democracy.\nFarag would like to believe his uncle in San Francisco who touts the American way. Farag devours Western news and culture as it comes to him in Cairo: He watches CNN and the BBC. He sees movies at the same time they're in their first run in Minneapolis.\nBut he's not convinced America has the best intentions for Egypt's future - for reasons not linked to politics. Farag is deeply offended by the \"big lies\" he says Western reporters relay.\n\"Some people when they come here to Egypt are expecting to see camels walking on the streets,\" he said. \"They see us as backwards, vulgar, tough and aggressive.   They ridicule the way we treat our women.   This is our religion. The hijab [scarf for women] is one of our traditions.\"\nAmerican soldiers appear to \"look at Muslims as sub-human,\" he said. \"I wish I could ask some of them what they are fighting for and why they are killing Muslims.   Sometimes I feel that they are creating war in other countries to prevent another attack on the United States. This will not work. It will not prevent another attack.\"\nThe United States has moved to build bridges toward democracy in Egypt by shifting its aid focus from basics such as health care and agricultural assistance. Now, one focus is \"good governance,\" according to the State Department, with pilot projects on judicial reform, legislative training and other foundations for democracy.\nFarag has another idea for building bridges. He wants to see a sincere showing of the mutual respect that could build trust.\n\"I want them to know that we are civilized people,\" he said. \"We have the oldest culture ever. I want them to discover how decent we are and generous. I want them to know the true ethics of the Egyptian people, the Middle Eastern people and the Muslims as a whole.\"\n.\nEGYPT'S EVOLVING ELECTION PROCESS\nIn September, President Hosni Mubarak won a fifth term with 88 percent of the vote in an election with 23 percent voter turnout. It was the country's first presidential election with a multicandidate popular vote. Egyptians previously voted on one candidate nominated by parliament. The new election law requiring political parties to have 5 percent representation in parliament to nominate a presidential candidate has made the Nov. 9 parliamentary elections crucial to opposition groups hoping for a stronger voice in the 2011 presidential vote.\n\nLoad-Date: October 25, 2005"
