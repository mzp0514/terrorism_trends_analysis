    "full text": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Vice President Dan Quayle said Wednesday that the threat to peace posed by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein vindicated the Republican-led U.S. military buildup of the past decade.  And he said it showed more than ever the need for the Strategic Defense Initiative - the ''Star Wars'' missile defense program.  Addressing the 72nd annual meeting of the American Legion, Quayle said that the lessening of East-West tension had not diminished the need for a strong national defense, including the Star Wars space shield against nuclear weapons.  ''As the Cold War comes to an end, the free world may be less burdened with fighting communist aggression. But there's a new evil: lawlessness and terrorism,'' Quayle said.  ''There are still brutal dictators who prefer the rule of the jungle instead of the rule of law,'' he said.  Saddam has used chemical weapons on his own people, supports terrorism and uses Americans and others as human shields, Quayle said.  Quayle said President George Bush would not be satisfied until Iraq withdrew all its forces from Kuwait and ensured the security of Saudi Arabia and the rest of the oil-rich Gulf region.  ''This is the first international crisis in the post-Cold War era. If Saddam Hussein's aggression remains unchecked, new and more terrible aggression will surely follow,'' he said.  Quayle criticized Congress for recent cuts in defense programs that would leave U.S. military forces with fewer options and less preparation to deal with sudden crises, such as the current one in the Gulf.\nHe said he was grateful for the general military buildup that has occurred under Bush and former President Ronald Reagan, and he called for new investment in research and development and in the Star Wars system.  Iraq and other regional powers are gaining ballistic missile capability, he said.  ''That's why the president thinks strategic defense makes more sense in the 1990s than ever before,'' Quayle said. ''That is why we will continue our work to slow and stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them.'' Quayle was interrupted frequently with applause and by two standing ovations.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPhoto; Photo by National Geographic Society via AP - Garbage Galore Children staring at a wall of trash at the nation's first garbage museum.
