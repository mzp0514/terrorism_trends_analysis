At the Pentagon, the Joint Chiefs of Staff started shaping contingency plans and military options for a possible reprisal against the terrorists.\nIn a Los Angeles hotel suite President Reagan gazed at the television pictures of the airport carnage with ''revulsion'' and ''anger,'' a close aide said. Almost immediately the President, who was in California for the New Year holiday, began receiving option papers on possible use of force and considered some type of armed reprisal.\nYet one week later, while returning home to Washington from a brief official visit to Mexico, Mr. Reagan sat in a front cabin of Air Force One and informed his closest aides that he was reluctant to take what a ranking White House aide termed ''the macho response'' to Libya.\nPolicy Options Weighed\nThe depiction of the President and his top advisers tensely weighing policy options in the days after the airport attacks was pieced together from interviews with White House, State Department and Pentagon officials.\nIn the week after the attacks Mr. Reagan and some of his closest aides concluded that Americans in Libya would be in danger if the United States carried out military reprisals and that the terrorist leader believed responsible for the attacks, Abu Nidal, and his followers were, for the moment, impossible to track down.\nMoreover, a bombing raid that did not kill terrorists, officials argued, would probably have scant support among the European allies and could cause political problems for the Administration among friendly Arab nations in the Middle East.\nIn an interview with European journalists made public today, Mr. Reagan suggested a theme voiced privately by his advisers in recent days - that with the departure of the remaining Americans from Libya, which he has ordered, the United States would be freer to take strong measures against Libya.\nMr. Reagan has said there is ''irrefutable evidence'' of Libyan involvement in the airport attacks.\n \nA Move to 'Untie Our Hands'\nMr. Reagan told the European journalists that by ordering the Americans out, he was able to ''untie our hands with regard to whatever action might be necessary in the future.''\nTuesday night, 11 days after the airport attacks, Mr. Reagan announced in a nationally televised news conference that although Libya ''has engaged in armed aggression against the United States,'' he was forgoing military action. Instead, Mr. Reagan cut economic ties with Libya and ordered Americans to leave immediately.\nBy all accounts, Mr. Reagan's response to the terrorism on Dec. 27 was marked by personal fury and by frustration about how to react to the killings of 19 people, including five Americans. It was also marked by a continuing but hesitant assessment of military options that were relayed to him in Los Angeles and Palm Springs.\n''There was the normal desire for a macho response, but it had to be restrained in view of the fact that we had 1,000 to 1,500 Americans over there,'' a ranking White House official said, referring to the State Department estimate of the number of Americans in Libya. ''Many of them would end up dead or injured,'' the official added. ''At best they would be held hostage.'' Mr. Reagan told one aide: ''I want to punish the right people. I don't want to lay waste the buildings of an area or a whole city and not know that we have hit the perpetrators.''\nA senior White House official remarked: ''If somebody said there's an apartment house on such-and-such street that Abu Nidal was in, we'd go after it. The problem is the lack of precision in the target. The problem is you're dealing with people in a fog. You don't see them. They're in shadows. Who is Abu Nidal? If he walked into this room would we recognize him? Where the hell does he hang out? Who are his followers?''\nAbu Nidal, whose real name is Sabry al-Banna, heads a group that split in the 1970's from Al Fatah, Yasir Arafat's mainstream group in the Palestine Liberation Organization. The United States says Abu Nidal's group, which is believed to use Libya as a haven, carried out the airport attacks. President's Reaction: 'Horror' at TV Scenes Mr. Reagan's immediate response to the airport attacks was, in the words of one aide, ''horror at what he saw'' on television in his suite at the Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles. Yet beyond that, officials indicated, Mr. Reagan almost immediately told his aides that the situation demanded a measured response - one that would not lead to the deaths of Americans in Libya and many Libyan civilians.\n''He was tempted by it, but he couldn't be satisfied by certain equations,'' a senior White House official said, describing Mr. Reagan's attitude on using force. ''He asked: 'What happens to our own people? Are we sure we're going to hit the right people? What are the targets that are worthwhile?' ''\nAnother White House official, who was with the President, said: ''There was a sense of outrage. He sees the image of the 11-year-old girl who was killed. It's sickening.''\nAnother official who was with Mr. Reagan said: ''His position that first day was, forgetting the hideousness of the attack, that the reaction had to be a measured one. If we knew the people who did it, we would retaliate. The kind of thing he said was, 'We want to retaliate, but we don't want to start World War III.' '' Shultz and Weinberger Split on Use of Force On Dec. 28, a day after the attacks, an interagency group to deal with the crisis was convened at the White House under Donald R. Fortier, deputy assistant to the President for national security affairs. Specialists from the Defense Department, the Central Intelligence Agency, the State Department, other agencies and the White House began examining military maps and satellite photographs and drawing up military contingency plans.\nThere was little hint publicly that United States officials were weighing military options. At the time, attention was focused on whether Israel would undertake some military retaliation.\nA White House official said Secretary of State George P. Shultz favored American military action against Libya, especially because he felt that evidence directly linked the Abu Nidal terrorist group to the airport attacks. Mr. Shultz's view, according to officials, was that the United States seemed virtually paralyzed after terrorist attacks abroad and that since evidence of Abu Nidal's link to Libya seemed clear, retaliation was in order.\nOn the other hand, officials said, Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger opposed use of force for several reasons. There was concern that a strike would inflame Arab nations and pose problems for American forces in the region. At the same time, officials said, Mr. Weinberger was concerned about public backlash if an attack failed and Americans or many Libyan civilians were killed or wounded.\nMr. Weinberger was especially worried about the risk of losing American planes in Libya. The Soviet Union recently sent SAM-5 missiles to Libya and may have technicians at the site.\nA key White House official said: ''This is not the first time I've seen this. The State Department is more militant than Defense. And Defense is more diplomacy-oriented than State.''\nA senior State Department official observed: ''If we are going to redress terrorism it has got to be a routine matter of retaliation soon after the terrorist deed, with the best intelligence we have and with standard operating procedures. We practice for things, we rehearse, we have procedures, we go and do it. We have never established this routine. When this happens, time and time again this Administration says, 'My gosh, what can we do?' '' Logistical Problems, Civilian and Military Officials indicated that at the outset of the crisis, some confusion marked planning because Mr. Reagan was in California without his chief advisers and other senior officials were scattered. Moreover, the aircraft carrier Coral Sea, whose planes would possibly be used in a military strike, was in Naples with most of its crew ashore.\n''It could have left port early without a full complement had there been a need, but on the other hand, had it left with half their people, it would have been noted in the Italian press,'' said one White House official. ''Where would your secret be?''\nOver the New Year holiday, Mr. Shultz and Donald T. Regan, the White House chief of staff, arrived, as originally planned, in Palm Springs to join the President and attend several parties at the estate of Walter H. Annenberg, the publisher. The three officials conferred on the estate as the State Department, on Dec. 31, issued a report that directly linked the Abu Nidal group to the airport terrorism and stressed the group's links to Libya.\nOn New Year's Day, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with Mr. Weinberger's approval, told the Navy to make preparations. Six EA-6B jamming planes were sent from Whidbey Island, off the coast of the state of Washington, to Sigonella Air Base in Sicily.\nAt the same time officers aboard the carrier America and the battleship Iowa, both moored in Norfolk, Va., were told to have their crews prepared to return to ship on 72 hours' notice to begin the 10-day trip to the Mediterranean. The crews were never called.\n''The military buildup and the military movements occurred largely in the media,'' said Robert B. Oakley, head of the State Department's counterterrorism office. ''Very little actually took place. There was a lot of contingency planning.''\nOn Jan. 2 Mr. Reagan returned to the Century Plaza in Los Angeles to prepare for a four-hour meeting the next day in the border town of Mexicali with President Miguel de la Madrid of Mexico. At the same time Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter, the national security adviser, and James A. Baker 3d, the Treasury Secretary, arrived in Los Angeles. Admiral Poindexter had additional military contingency plans.\nThe options, according to Administration officials, did not include a strike against the SAM-5 surface-to-air missiles being installed in Libya near the Gulf of Sidra. Attacks on these sites were ruled out apparently because they are staffed with Soviet technicians and bear no relation to the terrorists.\nThe list included strikes on one or more of the five main air bases along the Libyan coast or on some of the 15 terrorist training camps said to be situated in the Libyan desert. Administration officials said that the use of air power was considered the most feasible option against Libya.\nAlthough there had been initial discussion about using B-52 bombers flying from the United States and refueling in midair, this was dismissed by military leaders, Administration officials said. The Joint Chiefs considered the main assets to be Navy FA-18's and A-6 attack planes on the Coral Sea, and Air Force F-111's in Britain.\nOfficials said that on Jan. 3, as Mr. Reagan flew back from Mexicali, he weighed the military options with some of his closest aides, including Mr. Shultz, Mr. Regan, Mr. Baker and Admiral Poindexter. Aides indicated that the President, on the late-afternoon trip back to Washington, made it plain that he favored economic punishment of Libya, rather than military reprisal. Before Planners Meet, The Decision Is Clear A final decision on Libya was set aside until Monday, when the senior foreign policy and defense advisers in the Administration -the National Security Planning Group - were to meet in the late morning at the White House.\nBut by 8 A.M. Monday, as key officials of the White House staff held their first meeting of the year with Mr. Regan, it was evident that the President had already made up his mind: He would end economic ties to Libya and order the remaining Americans out.\nAn official at the 8 A.M. staff meeting said: ''My sense in listening to what was being said that morning was that the recommendation was going to come down for economic sanctions. By then it did not seem at all that the military option was serious. It wasn't even discussed. We were told that we should be quiet until the President made his announcement Tuesday night.''\nDays after the announcement, White House and Administration officials said the military option remained alive and, in essence, warned Libya that the line separating economic and military actions might one day be crossed.\n''We're inching toward a position where we've explored the economic options, we're executing those options,'' a White House official said. ''And once you exhaust those options, what's left? Are we upping the ante? Yes. Is the military option still available? It certainly is.''"
