There have already been too many deaths,\" Sarkozy said after a meeting with the defense, justice and foreign ministers.\nHe announced a new crackdown in France on the spread of terrorist-linked ideologies and activities.\nAnyone who regularly visits \"websites which support terrorism or call for hate or violence will be punished by the law,\" Sarkozy said. He promised a crackdown on anyone who goes abroad \"for the purposes of indoctrination in terrorist ideology.\"\n\nLoad-Date: March 29, 2012"
