It is not good.”\nOn today’s episode:\nMichael Schwirtz, an investigative reporter for The New York Times, talks about the suspect, Sayfullo Saipov.\nPeter Baker, The Times’s chief White House correspondent, discusses President Trump’s response.\nBackground reading:\nSayfullo Saipov left Uzbekistan in 2010 as a moderate Muslim with dreams of making it in the United States. But a life of disappointments awakened “monsters inside.”\n The attack in New York has brought scrutiny to a program that admits as many as 50,000 foreigners a year without requiring them to show family ties to the United States or special skills.\n President Trump has sought to turn the attack into a political talking point for his agenda on immigration and national security.\nTune in, and tell us what you think.
