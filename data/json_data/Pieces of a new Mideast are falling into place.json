    "full text": "Buy one, get one free isn't usually for treaties between nations, but it happened, so we offer high praise for President Trump, Jared Kushner and other key administration officials for engineering a pair of Israel-Arab peace pacts in less than a month, consummated on the White House South Lawn on Tuesday with signings by the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain with Israel.\nThe president -- a man, we need not remind you, we consider an overall disaster in the job -- delivered a breakthrough for cooperation and advancement in the Mideast. And there may be more to come; Trump insists \"we're very far down the road with about five countries, five additional countries.\"\nFor many, this will make for a very happy Jewish New Year, 5781, which starts Friday evening.\nThe \"circle of peace,\" as Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu called it as he stood with the foreign ministers of UAE and Bahrain, has now doubled from Egypt and Jordan. And there is no way that tiny Bahrain would have inked its deal without the okay of big brother Saudi Arabia. The Saudis, along the other gulf states of Kuwait, Oman and Qatar, are likely on Trump's list, as may be Morocco and Sudan.\nThe strategic consequence of this momentum, should it continue, is that Iran and its friends in terrorism and regional destabilization will be increasingly outflanked. Palestinians will, we hope, come to see that refusing to broker peace with Israel is a dead end.\nThere's a road ahead, and it leads to coexistence.\nNew York Daily News (Sept. 16)\n\nLoad-Date: September 17, 2020"
