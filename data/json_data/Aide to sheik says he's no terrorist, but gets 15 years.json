    "full text": "A deputy to a Yemeni cleric who plotted to raise money for al-Qaida was sentenced Thursday to a maximum 15 years in prison.\nThe sentence came despite his urgent disavowals of terrorism. \n\"I'm opposed to all sorts of terrorism, I swear to God,\" Mohammed Mohsen Yahya Zayed said in Arabic through an interpreter. \"I do not believe in terrorism.\"\nDefense attorney Jonathan Marks had argued that Zayed, 31, was a naive minor player in the conspiracy involving his boss, Sheik Mohammed Ali Hassan al-Moayad. Assistant U.S. Attorney Kelly Moore agreed that the defendant, though guilty, \"played a much smaller role\" than al-Moayad.\nBut U.S. District Judge Sterling Johnson Jr. ordered Zayed to serve consecutive five-year terms for convictions on three conspiracy counts. The judge in July sentenced al-Moayad to 75 years in prison, also the maximum.\nZayed was an aide to al-Moayad in 2003 when the two were lured by FBI informers to Germany. In meetings attended by Zayed, the sheik was recorded promising to funnel money to Hamas and al-Qaida; he also boasted that Osama bin Laden called him \"my sheik.\"\nOne of the informants, Mohamed Alanssi, described in testimony al-Moayad as a dedicated funder of terrorism who boasted of giving bin Laden $20 million in the years before Sept. 11.\n\nLoad-Date: September 3, 2005"
