In November, he was released on a $500,000 property bond posted by his mother.\nAttorney Linda Moreno of Tampa, Fla., wrote in her renewed motion for release that Asif Ahmed Salim would live with his wife and children at the home of his mother-in-law and father-in-law in Gwinnett County, Ga. In addition to Salim's wife and mother-in-law, his sister-in-law, Sabrina Nizam, also would serve as his custodian, the motion states. Nizam works as an assistant district attorney in Gwinnett County.\n\"Ms. Nizam has a personal abiding self-interest in making sure Mr. Salim complies with all conditions of release this Court would set, given that her family home, built by her parents, is at stake,\" the motion states.\nHe is being held in the Lucas County jail.\nA pretrial hearing for all four defendants is set for May 4. Their trial is expected to be held in January, 2017.\n\nLoad-Date: April 13, 2016"
