    "full text": "Just because the state of Kansas did not get a perfect score in domestic preparedness doesn't mean it will fail the course.\nSince the Sept. 11 attacks, more than $13 billion in domestic preparedness programs, promoting simulations, increase of health supplies and other ways to ensure the safety of the country.\nThese efforts cannot remain ignored.\nLocally, Riley County has made significant efforts, delegating responsibilities to the people who are experts in bio-terrorism and in preparing educational material for residents about possible disasters.\nAnd with additional area groups focusing on tornadoes and floods -- potential disasters in this area -- this assessment doesn't fully judge the entire picture in terms of Riley County preparedness.\nAlthough Kansas scored five out of 10 in an evaluation, a majority of states didn't even score this high. Even some states, including Alabama, Alaska, Iowa and New Hampshire scored the lowest by passing only two indicators.\nAs many critics claim, however, these tests are only a measurement of where the Kansas and the United States are in terms of preparedness.\nNow that the former Sept. 11 commission and Trust for America's Health reports reveal that most states are not-so-hot with terrorism responses, these areas should use these low grades as stepping-stones for further improvements.\nThere is always room for extra credit, and if the country uses these scores to its advantage, it can eventually change its score from passing to excellent.\n(C) 2005 Kansas State Collegian via U-WIRE\n\nLoad-Date: December 8, 2005"
