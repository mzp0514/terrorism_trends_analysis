Otherwise, the pilots I have spoken with are not wearing masks.\nWhat were cockpit security measures when you started flying and what are they like now?\n- Richard Manly, Altadena, California\nA lot has changed since I started flying 50 years ago. When I started with Piedmont Airlines in 1980, we locked the flight deck door.\nNow, the doors are much stronger and the locking mechanism is better. We did some passenger screening, but nothing like today.\nBack then, security was focused on hijacking for political or monetary extortion. Terrorism was confined to a very limited number of countries far away from our route structure.\nToday, one of the primary focuses of airline operation is security. After Sept. 11, 2001, security became one of the primary focuses of airline operations.\nBottom line: Our system is safer today than it was when I started.\nJohn Cox is a retired airline captain with US Airways and runs his own aviation safety consulting company, Safety Operating Systems. \n\nLoad-Date: March 30, 2020"
