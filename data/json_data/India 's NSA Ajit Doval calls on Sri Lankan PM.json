Maldivian Defence Minister Mariya Ahmed Didi arrived inColombo for the meeting while the Sri Lankan side was represented by Kamal Gunaratne, Secretary, Ministry of Defence.\nThis will be the first NSA level meeting on Trilateral Maritime Security Cooperation.\nIndia is now actively taking steps to bring some of its key neighbours under the Indo-Pacific framework in a bid to relax China's hold over countries in the region, official sources told ThePrint, requesting anonymity.\n\"The Ministry further said that the three countries exchanged views on common security threats and agreed to broad base cooperation by expanding the scope to improve intelligence sharing and include issues like terrorism, radicalization, extremism, drugs, arms and human trafficking, money laundering, cyber security and effect of climate change on maritime environment\".\nGerman Amazon workers strike on 'Black Friday'\nAmazon's online sales have skyrocketed during the coronavirus pandemic , and its revenue is projected to soar even higher with the holiday season.\nThe joint statement said the heads of delegations \"agreed to meet regularly to share, discuss and ensure timely implementation of the decisions taken in the meeting\". The Indian Ocean nations of Sri Lanka, Maldives and Seychelles are crucial for the informal Quad grouping - made up of India, the U.S., Japan, and Australia - as they seek to counter rising Chinese influence across Asia. \"They also chose to hold Deputy NSA level working group meetings biannually for cooperation at operational level\", the statement read.\n\"The past deliberations and outcomes have helped the three countries in improving close coordination in maritime security of the region. India, Maldives and SL recognise their role and responsibility in keeping the region safe & secure\", a tweet by Indian High Commission in Maldives said. Jayanath Colombage also attended the event, the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry tweeted without providing details of the meeting.\nAt a recent meeting between Sri Lanka's Foreign Secretary Jayanath Colombage with the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, Luo Zhaohui, who was also Beijing's former envoy toNew Delhi, both countries chose to \"expedite the implementation of the ongoing development cooperation projects, increase trade and investment\", said a statement by the Sri Lankan foreign ministry.\nSri Lanka had also invited Bangladesh as an observer, but the senior official was indisposed, stated sources.\nIndian National Security Adviser Ajith Doval instructed Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Gopal Baglay to expedite the process of initiating discussions with top officials in this regard. In January, Doval visited the island nation and discussed a range of bilateral issues, including strengthening cooperation in defence, intelligence sharing and maritime security with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.\n\nLoad-Date: November 29, 2020"
