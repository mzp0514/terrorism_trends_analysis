    "full text": "And so, terrorism rears its bloodthirsty head again, sparing no one, not even 80 of the young. First, explosions tore through government buildings in Oslo. Seven were killed and at least 15 injured.\nThen, on an island near the city, a man dressed as a police officer, likely the same man who detonated the bombs, opened fire. He didn't attack an army base. He attacked a youth camp connected to the ruling party, wreaking unimaginable carnage.\nOne teen tweeted: \"We are sitting down by the beach. A man is shooting clothed in a police uniform. Help us! When are the police coming to help us!\"\nThe questions are natural: Why Norway? What motivated this madness in Norway, as placid a place as can be imagined, home of the Nobel Peace Prize.\nPolice had a 32-tear-old Norwegian in custody and reported that his terrorism seemed to be of the right-wing extremist variety. One official said the blast was more Norway's Oklahoma City than its World Trade Center.\nThe roots of the fanatacism may be different, one the outgrowth of twisted religious belief, one the product of a political ideology. But the characteristics and effects are the same.\nZealotry is elevated over rational thought and human empathy. Self-righteousness becomes all. Life is reduced to a necessary expenditure.\nSo Norway suffers now the agony of mass death and the fear that flows from it. And here the mind remembers the bomb that refused to go off in Times Square and imagines the toll a gunman could inflict on any busy street here.\nWe are Norway. Norway is us.\n\nLoad-Date: July 23, 2011"
