    "full text": "If everyone who does not support the war in Iraq is a traitor, then according to a CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll, 63 percent of the United States should be hanged.\nRamsey Clark, former United States attorney general under President Johnson, has become this word's latest victim. He has agreed to become one of the lawyers representing Saddam Hussein in his war crimes trial. This is apparently a dangerous job. Two lawyers for the defense of Hussein and his cohorts have already been killed. However, Clark is still willing to take the case because he says that every person is entitled to a fair trial.\nThough this is not an American trial, a belief in the Sixth Amendment and the right to a fair trial are American ideals. Clark holds these ideals. Yet he, like any other American who does something to upset the administration or somehow question the war effort, has been labeled a traitor by neo-conservative Bush supporters, such as Probush.com and David Horowitz, editor of Frontpagemag.com.\nThis word is kryptonite to Americans. The brutal suggestion of a lack of patriotism in anyone who opposes the party line by the Bush administration and its supporters is morally reprehensible.\nRamsey Clark is not selling nuclear secrets to the Soviets. He is not conspiring to help the British take back New Jersey. He is simply upholding an American ideal in a foreign land and using his skills as a lawyer to do what he thinks is right.\nNo one has to agree with Clark's politics, which are overtly anti-war, but one has to admit that he has not acted in disloyalty to the United States and that the character assassination that has been perfected by this administration has reached a point of lunacy.\nRep. John Murtha, D-Penn., was recently lambasted for his decision to call for an timely withdrawal of the troops from Iraq. Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, gave him the political kiss of death by equating him with documentarian Michael Moore and the radical left. He complains that Murtha's plan would be surrendering to the terrorists and criticizes the plan for not explaining how it would make Americans safer.\nOne has to suppose that McClellan is omitting the obvious way, which is that if Americans were not in Iraq to get shot at, they would be safer.\nVice President Cheney alluded to Murtha as among politicians who had \"lost their memory, or their backbone,\" and that he and the president would not \"let them rewrite history.\"\nYet Murtha is a Vietnam veteran and an extremely loyal American. He did not call this action because he wanted to give \"the terrorists\" a victory as suggested by McClellan nor because he has lost his backbone.\nHe probably called for the withdrawal so that 10 years from now, unlike most current members of Congress, he will be able to sleep at night -- because he tried. He recognized a huge problem for America and tried to stop it.\nFortunately this time, the public refused to listen to the character attacks on Murtha. President Bush and Vice President Cheney were forced to repeat what a good man they thought Murtha was but that they still disagreed with him respectfully. What a difference a poll makes.\nAs a citizen, I am appalled by this administration's verbal terrorism. Throwing bombs like the word 'traitor' and the phrase 'rewriting history' at innocent Americans simply because they disagree with the position of the White House goes against the American obligation to question its leaders.\nNotice that I do not refer to those in the Bush camp lobbing these attacks as traitors to make this argument. They are definitely not people I want standing in my living room telling me what to believe, but just because I disagree with them does not make them unpatriotic to my country.\nThe threat of being called unpatriotic to the U.S. public is not just politically damaging, it damages the democratic deliberation of key issues and concerns among citizens. The label of traitor is one of aggressive intimidation and has no place among peaceful argument.\n(C) 2005 Daily Texan via U-WIRE\n\nLoad-Date: November 30, 2005"
