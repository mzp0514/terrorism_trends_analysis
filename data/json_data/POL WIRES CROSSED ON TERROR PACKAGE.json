    "full text": "WASHINGTON The push for new anti-terrorism legislation stalled yesterday amid bi-partisan wrangling and Congress' desire to recess by the weekend.\nWhite House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta, the point man for President Clinton on the issue, met into the night with a GOP and Democratic task force in an attempt to fashion a package that would include expanded wiretapping powers for the FBI and a requirement for \"taggant\" tracers in all explosives.\nBut the Republicans balked at the taggants measure while several Democrats said they might offer amendments to expand the scope of the proposed legislation.\nRep. Harold Rogers (R-Ky.), a member of the task force, also claimed that the Justice Department already is failing to spend money earmarked for anti-terrorism.\n\"It is inexcusable that resources to fight terrorism are going unused, and I demand to know why,\" Rogers wrote to Attorney General Janet Reno.\nBut Rep. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), another member of the task force, said that the Rogers letter and other GOP maneuvers were the result of House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and his allies \"playing games by adding these new proposals.\"\nHe said, \"I think they're just stalling. They're putting things on the table that would take months to debate.\"\nThe President is pressing to allow the FBI to use \"multi-point\" wiretaps, which allow law enforcement agents to monitor all phone calls made by a suspected terrorist, rather than just those from a specific telephone.\nTaggants are tiny plastic tracers that manufacturers would be required to add to explosives to allow law enforcement officers to trace them by lot to their point of sale.\n\nLoad-Date: August 1, 1996"
