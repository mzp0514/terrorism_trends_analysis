    "full text": "The commander of Italian forces in Somalia said Friday U.N. forces could not combat Somalian terrorism with \"the same means,\" and that Italy would pull its soldiers out of Mogadishu next month to protest U.N. military tactics.  The commander, Gen. Bruno Loi, said terrorist attacks on U.N. forces had increased \"in quantity and efficiency.\"\nBy adopting a harsh military response, U.N. forces were using the same tactics as the fighters of clan warlords, he said.  \"We cannot use the same means,\" he said through an interpreter. \"It started as a humanitarian mission, and it must remain a humanitarian mission.\" Loi's remarks were the most critical by an alliance member on the new military aggressiveness of the American-dominated U.N. command. The agency accused him of insubordination last month.  Italy announced Thursday that it would pull most of its 800 troops out of the capital and send them to rural central Somalia, where the rest of the Italian contingent is based.  The departure of Italian peacekeepers from the embattled seaside capital \"is the only way we can show we don't agree with the policies of the United Nations,\" Loi said.  Senior American officers said unilateral actions by the Italians endangered the lives of other peacekeepers, and some have said they would welcome the departure of Italian forces from Mogadishu.\n\nLoad-Date: October 11, 1993"
