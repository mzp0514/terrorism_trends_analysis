    "full text": "WASHINGTON -- The Senate is moving toward final approval of an anti-terrorism package giving police new powers to secretly search homes, tap telephone conversations and track Internet use despite warnings from human right and privacy advocates that the legislation goes too far.\nThe Senate will vote on President Bush's anti-terrorism legislation before leaving Thursday, Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said.\nSince the terrorist attacks, Bush and Attorney General John Ashcroft have demanded legislation to expand the FBI's wiretapping and electronic surveillance authority, impose stronger penalties on those who harbor or finance terrorists and increase punishments of terrorists.\n\"These laws will help ensure that Americans will never be violated in the way we were on Sept. 11,\" said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.\nThe bill, approved by the House 357-66 on Wednesday, goes to the White House for Bush's signature after Senate approval.\nMeanwhile, the $100 billion economic stimulus package passed by the House is likely to undergo significant change in the Senate, where far greater support exists for additional spending and far less for cuts in business taxes.\nThe House bill, passed Wednesday by a wafer-thin 216-214 margin, comprises almost entirely tax cuts. President Bush says he is willing to negotiate with Democrats but does not want a stimulus plan composed mostly of new spending.\n\nLoad-Date: October 25, 2001"
