With the Obama administration making serious efforts to restore relations with Cuba, there were speculations that Cuba would be taken off the list.\nPresident Obama recently lifted travel restrictions for Cuban Americans, but retained the 47-year old U.S. trade embargo on the communist nation, saying that it will not be lifted until the communist nation takes notable steps towards democracy, including the release of some 219 political dissidents currently jailed in Cuba.\nFidel Castro had ceded power to his brother Raul in February 2008, following an emergency stomach surgery in July 2006, and has made very few public appearances since then. However, his essays on Cuban and international politics appear frequently on government websites and state-run news agencies.\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\nCopyright(c) 2009 RTTNews.com, Inc.
