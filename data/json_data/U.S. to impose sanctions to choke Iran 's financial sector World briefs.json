Earlier rounds of U.S. sanctions have crushed its economy by curbing oil sales and most other trade.\nThe administration has been weighing the move for weeks, Bloomberg News reported last month. Under the measures, the administration could blacklist as many as 14 banks in Iran that have so far escaped some U.S. restrictions, using authorities designed to punish entities associated with terrorism, ballistic-missile development and human-rights abuses.\nThe Washington Post reported that the sanctions are expected to be announced Thursday.\nThe measures would have two objectives, according to people familiar with the plans, who asked not to be identified discussing internal deliberations: close one of the few remaining financial loopholes allowing Iran's government to earn revenue, and stymie Democrat Joe Biden's promise to re-enter a 2015 nuclear deal if he wins the presidency\nUnder the plan, the administration would designate the Iranian financial sector under Executive Order 13902, which President Donald Trump signed in January to clamp down on mining, construction and other industries. That would not only affect banks but also remittance processors, money-changers and the informal transfer system known as hawala.\n\nLoad-Date: October 8, 2020"
