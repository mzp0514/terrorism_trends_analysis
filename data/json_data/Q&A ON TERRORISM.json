At what point is it not curable with antibiotics?\n--- Mikel Estes, Marietta A:Robert Stevens, 63, a photo editor at the Sun tabloid, died Oct. 5 of inhaled anthrax. He was the first person in the United States to die of inhaled anthrax since 1976.\nAJC\nAntibiotics might have helped Stevens, but only if he had known he had been exposed to anthrax spores and sought help right away. With inhaled anthrax, if antibiotic treatment does not begin before symptoms appear --- in as little as one day --- the disease usually is fatal. Stevens had no idea he had been exposed, and was very ill by the time he was taken to the hospital. It was too late for antibiotics to save him.\nAnother case of inhalational anthrax, this one in the District of Columbia, has left a postal worker gravely ill.  The six reported anthrax cases in New York and New Jersey all involve cutaneous, or skin, anthrax, which is much less lethal and more easily treated, even after symptoms have appeared. Without antibiotics, about 80 percent of patients survive; with the drugs, more than 99 percent do, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nDo you have a question about the news?

Anthrax spores can survive for decades, often in soil, before touching an animal's body and developing into \"adult\" bacteria.\nCipro: The brand name for the drug ciproflaxin, it is the most commonly prescribed antibiotic for anthrax. It is not the only drug that fights anthrax infections, however; penicillin and doxycycline are both approved for such use.\nAum Shinrikyo: The terrorist group that tried, but failed, to infect Tokyo with anthrax in the early 1990s. (The group did kill 12 and sicken thousands when it released the nerve gas sarin in a Tokyo subway.)\nBioPort: The Lansing, Mich.-based supplier of anthrax vaccine to the U.S. military. Accused of mismanagement and quality-control problems, the company has lacked approval to ship the medicine since 1998. The company was sued Friday on behalf of two soldiers who received the vaccine. The suit claims the vaccine killed one and caused chronic health problems in the other.\n \nBACKGROUNDERS\nThe terrorist attacks have brought many unfamiliar people, places and things to the fore.\nThe AJC will explore these topics Monday through Saturday on Backgrounder pages.\nBackgrounders from previous editions are available on ajc.com.
