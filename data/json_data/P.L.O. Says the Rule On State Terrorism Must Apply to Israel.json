One official said both sides had to analyze the opening round first.\nMr. Abed said Mr. Arafat is ''a real target of assassination.'' Security around the chairman appears to have been increased. At his news conference, he carried both his usual sidearm and an Italian submachine gun.\n''What happened yesterday is proof that Israeli policy is now state terrorism,'' Mr. Arafat said of the deaths in clashes in the occupied West Bank.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPhoto of Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, at a news session in Tunis, at which he carried a submachine gun (Agence France-Presse)"
