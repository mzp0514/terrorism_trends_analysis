    "full text": "We never thought we would see the day when Barack Obama would stand to the right of Jim Gilmore. But that day has come to pass.\nObama recently signed a defense authorization bill that, over the military's own objections, directs the military to hold alleged enemy combatants indefinitely, and permits it to detain American citizens, without charges, indefinitely as well.\nGilmore, a former governor of Virginia who garnered a mere 33 percent in his 2008 Senate race against Democrat Mark Warner, is a staunch conservative by anyone's measure. He also headed up a national commission on terrorism that produced serious reports on the issue at a time when al-Qaida was on very few radar screens. He was warning about homeland security before there was a department for it. And he takes a dim view of the new legislation.\n\"Our commission thought it was extraordinarily dangerous to extend the role of the military in the homeland,\" he said recently. \"This is the wrong road to go down.\"\nGilmore was right then. He is right now. When Obama campaigned for president, he criticized the Bush administration's anti-constitutional excesses in the war on terror. He has now signed off on legislation that is even worse.\nCopyright Â© 2012, The Richmond Times-Dispatch and may not be republished without permission.
