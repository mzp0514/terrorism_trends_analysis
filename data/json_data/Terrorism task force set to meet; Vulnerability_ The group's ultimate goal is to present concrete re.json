Scott McCallum last month to act as a clearinghouse of experts and information on the state's terrorism defenses.\nThe ultimate goal of the 20-member panel is to submit concrete recommendations to the governor, but its members are not bowing to formality, said Ed Gleason, administrator of the Division of Emergency Management.\n\"We're not waiting. If we find something we need to do, we do it,\" Gleason said. \"Everything we've done has been focused on getting things done real time.\"\nThe task force has been helpful in connecting people from different state agencies and evaluating where the state's strengths and weaknesses lie in responding and preventing terrorism, Gleason said.\nFor example, many members of the task force were previously unaware that the Department of Justice has a cyberterrorism unit, he said. And while the leaders of the 72 counties do not usually communicate, the task force plans to make that happen, Gleason said.\nAlso, fire, police and public health leaders have been determining how an additional $$ @2.78 million from the federal government for personal protective, detection and communications equipment would be best spent. \n\"A lot of the things we're doing are the heavy lifting behind the scenes,\" said Gleason, who is also co-chair of the task force. \"I'm satisfied that we've got all levels of the response community very actively energized to make sure they're doing what they have to do.\"\nThe governor has received weekly briefings from members of the task force and has been satisfied with their progress so far, said McCallum spokesman Tim Roby.\nOne of the first jobs for the task force, led by the Division of Emergency Management, was to ensure that information gathered by the Division of Public Health and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was distributed to instruct residents and first-responders how to analyze and react to anthrax scares.\n\"We're not suggesting decontamination, we're not suggesting putting anyone on antibiotics until the preliminary results are back,\" said Steve Marshall, the state's bioterrorism preparedness coordinator.\nThe Division of Public Health and other officials are also working to draft an epidemiology response plan in the case of a small-, medium- or large-scale biological attack in Wisconsin, Marshall said.\nHe said the task force has been helpful in pooling the resources of state and local agencies.\n\"I think we're still kind of in the middle of fully understanding what all those resources are,\" he said.\nThe task force is scheduled to meet for the third time on Nov. 30\n\nLoad-Date: November 27, 2001"
