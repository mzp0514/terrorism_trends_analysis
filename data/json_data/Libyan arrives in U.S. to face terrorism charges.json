    "full text": "WASHINGTON - After a weeklong interrogation aboard a U.S. warship, a Libyan al-Qaida suspect is now in New York awaiting trial on terrorism charges, U.S. officials said Monday.\nAbu Anas al-Libi was grabbed in a military raid in Libya on Oct. 5. He's due to stand trial in Manhattan, where he has been under indictment for more than a decade on charges he helped plan and conduct surveillance for the bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa in 1998.\nPreet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for the southern district of New York, confirmed that al-Libi was transferred to law enforcement custody over the weekend. Al-Libi was expected to be arraigned today, Bharara said.\nPresident Barack Obama's administration took criticism years ago when it decided to prosecute admitted 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Moham-med in New York, rather than at the naval prison at Guantanamo Bay. After reversing course, however, the government has successfully prosecuted several terrorism cases in civilian courts.\nA federal law enforcement official and two other U.S. officials said al-Libi arrived in New York on Saturday.\nAl-Libi's al-Qaida ties date back to the terrorist group's early years, according to court documents, potentially making him a valuable source of information about the group's history. Intelligence officials interrogated him for a week aboard the U.S.S. San Antonio in the Mediterranean.\n\nLoad-Date: October 16, 2013"
