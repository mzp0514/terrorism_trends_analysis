    "full text": "THE ACCUSED masterminds of a multimillion-dollar cigarette smuggling ring arrived in New York on Wednesday to face charges as police probe whether they're funding terrorism.\nBasel and Samir Ramadan were arrested last week in Maryland in a takedown by state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and the NYPD.\nInvestigators said the ring cleared $22 million in profits in the last 17 months, but so far they've been able to account for only $7.8 million of that money. The probe is now focused on whether some of the profits wound up overseas.\nSixteen people were charged with enterprise corruption - not terrorism - but one of those arrested has ties to a top leader of Hamas, while a second had financial ties to the blind sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, convicted in a foiled 1993 plot to blow up New York City landmarks, police said.\nThe NYPD identified another defendant as a \"confidant\" of Rashid Baz, a Middle Eastern man convicted of shooting at a van full of Yeshiva students on the Brooklyn Bridge in 1994, killing 16-year-old Ari Halberstam.\nWhen accused ringleader Basel Ramadan, 42, was arrested at his home in Maryland last week, authorities say they found three unlicensed handguns and $1 million in cash.\nThe brothers were taken Wednesday to the 72nd Precinct in Brooklyn and were scheduled to be arraigned Thursday in Brooklyn Supreme Court.\ngsmith@nydailynews.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \nBasel Ramadan and Samir Ramadan\n\nLoad-Date: May 23, 2013"
