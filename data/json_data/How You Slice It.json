    "full text": "The other day Gov. Tim Kaine announced more than a quarter-million dollars in anti-terrorism grants. Virginia doled out the federal money through the Criminal Justice Service Board to 53 localities, and capped grants at $5,000 each.\n So, for instance, Norfolk (population 235,000) got $3,314 - while Wythe County (population 28,000) got $5,000. New Kent (pop. 16,000) got $4,910, while Fairfax (pop. 1 million) got all of $30 more.\n The grants are not the only terrorism-prevention funds being distributed - they're just a drop in the bucket. Indeed, they are being paid for with leftover funds from a prior year. Norfolk is not going without. For that matter, small places like Wythe and New Kent could make a good case that the high-profile targets suck up huge amounts of anti-terror money, while poor counties that need help get left out entirely. On the other hand, the likelihood of a major terrorist attack in a rural area seeems remote.\n The minor issue illustrates a point about a major one - the state budget: There's usually a good argument for slicing the pie each of several different ways, and for questioning whether one way might not be slightly better than another. Officials generally don't get to make the easy choice between worthy and unworthy causes; they have to make the harder choice from among competing good causes.\n But - for that very reason - the distribution they settle on probably will not prove calamitous. Those who act as though any compromise is tantamount to murder are either nuts - or pretending to be for tactical reasons.\n\nLoad-Date: April 4, 2008"
