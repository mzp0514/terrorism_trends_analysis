The newest collectible cards on the trading block are George Bush and Osama bin Laden.\nTwo Condoleezza Rices will get you a Rudolph Giuliani.\nSeveral Denver-area sports-card shops are selling a series of 90 glossy cards devoted to the war on terrorism.\nProduced by the Topps Co., the Enduring Freedom Picture Cards depict military and civilian leaders, as well as New York City police officers and firefighters.\n\"They've had some interest, obviously not as much as the baseball cards, but they've been fairly popular,\" said Brett Lehrer of Bill's Sports Collectibles in Denver.\nThe cards are sold in wax-wrapped sets of seven with a patriotic sticker instead of the traditional piece of gum.\nPeople seem to appreciate that a portion of the money goes to some of the relief efforts, such as the Twin Towers fund, said Sally Farnsworth, co-owner of All C's Collectibles in Aurora, Colo.\nHowever, it remains to be seen whether Enduring Freedom cards will have any long-term value as collectibles, Farnsworth said.\nAlthough Topps is better known for the baseball cards it has produced for more than 50 years, this is not the first time it has turned to historic topics.\nThe company has published cards devoted to the Korean War, the Civil War, Operation Desert Storm and produced the Man on the Moon Cards series.\nThe decision to produce this latest series came shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, said Topps CEO Arthur Shorin.\nShorin said the cards are aimed at providing children with reassuring information about the events they see unfolding on television and in the newspapers.\n\"They need to understand that the president and his advisers are going to keep them safe and that the bad guys will be dealt with,\" Shorin said.\nCompany officials debated over whether to include al Qaida leader bin Laden's picture in the series. But they did.\n\"How can he not be in it?\" Storin said. \"We expect many kids will use that card to act out their disdain for the guy.\"\nHe has already heard of one kid who smeared peanut butter on the bin Laden card.\nThe cards attracted interest from at least one nontraditional customer. Storin said Topps recently received a request from French President Jacques Chirac.\n\"He wanted to autograph them and send them to his friends,\" Storin said.\n\nLoad-Date: December 7, 2001"
