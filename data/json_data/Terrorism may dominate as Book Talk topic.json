    "full text": "It's impossible to ignore the similarities between the events depicted in Thomas Harris' \"Black Sunday\" and the global terrorism crisis today. And the terrorist plot that is the centerpiece of his 1975 debut promises to be a significant part of the discussion when the Sunday Book Club hosts its next Book Talk at Taylor Books on Monday at 6 p.m.\nIn addition to the terrorism theme, discussion leader Carol Campbell plans also to lead the group in an exploration of the villains of the novel and compare and contrast them to Harris' most famous monster, Hannibal Lecter.\nLander, Dahlia and their terrorist counterparts are perhaps less over the top than Lecter, but their madness is no less frightful.\nFinally, after reading the novel, one cannot help but wonder at the terrorists' motivations. Lander, the mastermind of the plot, is an American Vietnam veteran, and his Arab co-conspirators seethe with hatred for Americans and, even more so, for Israelis. In many ways, little has changed since Harris' book was published 28 years ago.\nIf you are unable to attend Monday's Book Talk and would like to start a discussion or offer comments, visit www .sundaygazettemail.com and check out our new blog.\nTo contact Regina C. Davis, use e-mail or call 348-7936.\n\nLoad-Date: December 1, 2003"
