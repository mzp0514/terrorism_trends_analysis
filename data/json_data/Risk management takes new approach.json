Our biggest risk management concern today is terrorism.\"\n\"It is not something a consultant can do,\" she said. \"It's a mind-set change. It's something that's cultural and really takes some time.\"\neburgin@hpe.com|888-3533\nERM identifies risks for businesses, higher education and individuals in advance and proactively develop measures to comply with regulations.\nCopyright (c) 2007, High Point Enterprise, N.C.
