Brian Schmautz, spokesman for the Portland Police Bureau, said of the bomb scare.\nThere was no bomb, and the situation was resolved shortly after 4 p.m., Schmautz said.\nA car being driven by someone associated with TOPOFF4 appears to have caused the scare, he said.\nThere are two possibilities.\nThe first is that someone may  have been carrying a firearm that set off the dogs.\nThe second? One or more of the cars in the parking garage may have been covered with residue from a bus that was blown up on Tuesday as part of the terrorism exercise.\nEither way, everything has been cleared, according to Schmautz.\n\"There is no danger to the community,\" he said.\n\nLoad-Date: October 19, 2007"
