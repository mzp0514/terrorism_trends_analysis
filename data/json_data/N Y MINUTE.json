He was acquitted of one count of disseminating obscene photos on his Web site, Slavespace.com.\nThe jury deliberated for seven days, poring over a mountain of evidence that included 4,000 images from the Web site depicting women being restrained, beaten, poked with needles and humiliated.\nMarcus was allowed to remain free on $1 million bail and reside at his parents' home in Long Island.\nJohn Marzulli.\nTerror-insurance bill\nMAYOR BLOOMBERG and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) appealed to Congress yesterday to renew a law that provides insurance against terrorism, saying hundreds of billions of dollars in economic activity is at stake. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act requires insurers to provide coverage against terrorism but it caps their total liability, with the feds picking up the remainder. The law expires at the end of this year.\nMichael Saul.\nMike pans gay ban\nMAYOR BLOOMBERG criticized the organizers of New York's St. Patrick's Day Parade yesterday for banning gay groups from marching, one day after City Council Speaker Christine Quinn announced she will travel to Ireland to march as an openly gay woman in Dublin's March 17 parade.\nBloomberg said the law allows the parade's organizers to prohibit certain groups from marching, but he thinks the organizers are wrong for doing so.\nMichael Saul.\nTaco Bell suit crawls on\nA BROOKLYN judge rejected a request yesterday from lawyers for Taco Bell to postpone a personal-injury trial because of the bad publicity surrounding a rat invasion in the chain's Greenwich Village restaurant.\nFederal Judge Sandra Townes ordered lawyers to pick a jury yesterday, rejecting concerns by the embattled company that it can't get a fair trial even though it's a slip-and-fall negligence case.\nVideos circulating on the Internet last month blew the lid off the rodent scandal at the Taco Bell on Sixth Ave. and W. Fourth St., showing numerous rats scampering around the restaurant.\nJohn Marzulli\n\nLoad-Date: March 6, 2007"
