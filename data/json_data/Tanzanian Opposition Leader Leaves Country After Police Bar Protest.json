He returned to Tanzania this year from Belgium to challenge the country’s president, John Magufuli, a populist who won a second term in October.\nMr. Lissu and other opposition leaders had urged citizens into the streets for an “endless peaceful demonstration” over the Oct. 28 election, in which widespread fraud was alleged and many observers were barred. But police blocked the protest.\nThe opposition leader had been housed at the German embassy since Nov. 2, when he was released by police after hours of interrogation.\nThe United States and others noted credible allegations that called the vote’s results — and the East African country’s democratic ideals — into question. Allegations included the rejection of thousands of election observers, a massive slowdown in internet and text-messaging services and ballot box stuffing.\nSeveral opposition leaders were arrested or beaten or both around the vote. The chairman of the Chadema opposition party, Freeman Mbowe, and two other Chadema leaders were charged with “terrorism-related offenses.”\nMr. Magufuli later noted “a few challenges” around the election but called it generally peaceful. The government has denied any cases of intimidation.\nOn Tuesday the United Nations human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, said in a statement that she was “disturbed by reports of continued intimidation and harassment against opposition leaders and members in Tanzania” after the vote.\nThe statement added: “Reports indicate that at least 150 opposition leaders and members have been arrested since 27 October in mainland Tanzania and in Zanzibar. While most have been subsequently released, at least 18 reportedly remain in custody.”\nShe said those detained for exercising their human rights should be released.\nPHOTO: Tundu Lissu casting his vote last month in the town of Ikungi, in the Singida Region, of north Tanzania.
