It really upsets me.\"\nResidents in the community near Avenue H, known as \"Little Pakistan,\" said they fear that New Yorkers will retaliate after the arrest of Faisal Shahzad, a 30-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen from Pakistan charged with trying to blow up Times Square last weekend.\n\"It affected us when 9/11 happened, now this happens,\" said Mohammad Bashir, a grocery-store owner who moved here from Pakistan 25 years ago.\nHumera Nisar, 36, works at a convenience store on Coney Island Ave.\n\"I'm scared,\" said Nisar, who left Pakistan more than 15 years ago. \"It's not good. Everybody just wants peace.\"\nAsim Kayani, 35, said Pakistanis living in the United States should not be judged by the behavior of radical Islamic terrorists overseas.\n\"Every country has some black sheep,\" he said.\nGul Mohammad, 57, said most Pakistanis don't support terrorism.\n\"This is not good for anybody. We don't like terrorism. We oppose all these things,\" Mohammad said. \"We need peace, we need brotherhood.\" sgaskell@nydailynews.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \nMembers of Brooklyn's Pakistani community are worried about connections to Pakistan and terrorism.
