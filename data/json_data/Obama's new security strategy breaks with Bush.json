It's an approach that already has proved tricky in practice.\nThe administration's National Security Strategy, a summary of which was obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press, also for the first time adds homegrown terrorism to the familiar menu of threats facing the nation -- international terror, nuclear weapons proliferation, economic instability, global climate change and an erosion of democratic freedoms abroad.\nFrom mustering NATO forces for Afghanistan to corralling support to pressure North Korea to give up its illicit nuclear weapons program, the U.S. has sometimes struggled in leaning on friends and allies in recent years. Still, the new strategy breaks with some previous administrations in putting heavy emphasis on the value of global cooperation, developing wider security partnerships and helping other nations provide for their own defense.\nIn his first 16 months in office, Obama has pursued a strategy of gentle persuasion, sometimes summarized as \"engagement.\"\nHis administration has attended more closely to ties with Europe, sought a \"reset\" of relations with Russia, pushed harder to restart stalled Mideast peace talks and consulted widely on a roadmap for defeating the Taliban in Afghanistan.\nObama's critics, however, assert that his policies have largely failed, given the continued defiance of Iran and North Korea on nuclear development, the stalemate in Afghanistan and rising worries about terrorist attacks at home.\nPresidents use their national security strategy to set broad goals and priorities for keeping Americans safe. But the document isn't an academic exercise: it has far-reaching effects on spending, defense policies and security strategy.\nFor example, President George W. Bush's 2002 strategy document spelled out a doctrine of pre-emptive war.\nObama's new strategy is expected to move away from that doctrine.\nBush, too, valued alliances. But some of his action, especially the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, ripped holes in the fabric of U.S. foreign relations, particularly in Europe.
