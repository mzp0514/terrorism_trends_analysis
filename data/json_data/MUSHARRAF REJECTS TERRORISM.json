Pervez Musharraf's statement came after a meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who welcomed the declaration but sought greater efforts to end the standoff with India that has put both nations on a war footing.\n\"Pakistan rejects terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,\" Musharraf said.\nHe did not repeat his past contention that Pakistan does not consider the Kashmiri fighters terrorists, just \"freedom fighters,\" a distinction that Blair implied was untenable in the world climate after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States.\nPresident Bush, meanwhile, urged Musharraf to work harder to rein in terrorists.\n\"I don't believe the situation is defused yet, but I do believe there is a way to do so,\" Bush told reporters in the Oval Office. \"I think it's very important for President Musharraf to make a clear statement to the world that he intends to crack down on terror.\"\nBlair and Bush have been trying to get the two nuclear-armed neighbors to settle the newest outbreak of tension that began when suspected Muslim militants attacked the Indian Parliament on Dec. 13.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nC.N.
