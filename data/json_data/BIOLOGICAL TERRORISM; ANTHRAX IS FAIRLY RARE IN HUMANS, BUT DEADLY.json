    "full text": "Anthrax, a deadly bacterial infection, is primarily a disease of domesticated and wild animals.\nHumans become infected when they come in contact with diseased animals, their hides, hair or excrement.\nIn humans, anthrax is fairly rare, and there is no evidence of person-to-person transmission of the disease.\nFor people who contract the disease, however, the death rate is about 80 percent.\nThe most common form in humans is cutaneous anthrax, acquired through injured skin or mucous membranes.\nA raised, itchy area develops at the entry point in the skin, which rapidly turns into a large blister and eventually a black scab with swelling of the surrounding tissues.\nIn severe cases, the infection produces blood poisoning, which is frequently fatal.\nEating anthrax-infected meat produces symptoms of severe stomach and intestinal inflammation, with fever, diarrhea and vomiting.\nAnother, though rare, form of the disease is inhalation anthrax, or woolsorters' disease. Commonly it results from breathing dust where animal hair or hides are being handled.\nInhalation anthrax may result in a severe case of pneumonia. Victims experience a gradual onset of vague symptoms such as fatigue, fever, mild chest discomfort and possibly a dry cough.\nThe symptoms can improve for a few hours or even two or three days, before worsening with a sudden difficulty breathing, profuse sweating, internal bleeding, blue-colored skin, shock and death in 24 to 36 hours, if treatment cannot stop the infection.\nAnthrax spores can survive in soil and water and on surfaces for many years.\nSpores can be destroyed by steam sterilization or burning, but not by disinfectants.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO\n\nLoad-Date: April 2, 1999"
