    "full text": "Editor, New Era:\nIn a recent letter to the editor, Kelly Dowell argued for a U.S.-led attack on terrorism against -- Israel?\nAllow me a few words to respond to Ms. Dowell and others who may find comfort in her arguments.\n#BLOW.BRUK.CA#International terrorism and national self-defense are two totally different forces which elicit totally different responses from the international community.\nBy equating Israel's political/military actions in the name of self-defense to those of terror organizations such as Hamas or al-Qaida, Ms. Dowell makes a serious argumentative mistake.\nAs a member of the United Nations, Israel has been recognized as a sovereign nation-state and as so has been accorded international understanding in relation to defense of its borders, its laws and its citizens.\nThat same recognition, tenuous though it was, now appears to be fading for Arafat's PLO, to say nothing about terror organizations such as Hamas or al-Qaida.\nAlthough not able to claim an extensive knowledge of the Zionist movement, I do know that Israel has proven itself a formidable democratic society with sovereign control over its borders in at least three wars since 1940.\nIsrael is as legitimate a nation-state as is Britain or France and thus deserves our full support in its own war against terrorism.\nIn light of this reality, any actions the Israeli government undertakes to defend its sovereign power must be termed national self-defense.\nAny attempt by Ms. Dowell or others like her to equate such actions with international terrorism and thus reason for American action against an \"Israeli terrorist state\" should be met with fierce opposition.\nJohn A. Blowers\nEast Lampeter\n\nLoad-Date: January 3, 2002"
