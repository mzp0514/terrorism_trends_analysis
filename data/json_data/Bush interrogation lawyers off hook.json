Bush's administration. President Barack Obama campaigned on abolishing the simulated drowning technique of waterboarding and other tactics that he called torture, but he left open the question of whether anyone would be punished for authorizing such methods.\nAn initial review by the Justice Department's internal affairs unit found that former government lawyers Jay Bybee and John Yoo had committed professional misconduct, a conclusion that could have cost them their law licenses. But, underscoring just how controversial and legally thorny the memos have become, the Justice Department's top career lawyer reviewed the matter and disagreed.\n\"This decision should not be viewed as an endorsement of the legal work that underlies those memoranda,\" Assistant Deputy Attorney General David Margolis wrote in a memo released Friday.\nMargolis, the top nonpolitical Justice Department lawyer and a veteran of several administrations, called the legal memos \"flawed\" and said that, at every opportunity, they gave interrogators as much leeway as possible under U.S. torture laws. But he said Yoo and Bybee were not reckless and did not knowingly give incorrect advice, the standard for misconduct. Lawyer, BYU alum\nJay Bybee, now a judge on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals based in San Francisco, earned an undergraduate and law degrees from Brigham Young University. He served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Chile.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nFILE - In this Feb. 14, 2002 file photo, Jay Bybee testifies before a congressional committee in Washington.
