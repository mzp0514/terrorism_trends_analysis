    "full text": "A Maryland student accused of conspiring with the Montgomery County woman known as \"Jihad Jane\" plans to plead guilty.\n Court papers filed Monday show that Mohammad Hassan Khalid, 18, is due in court in Philadelphia next month for a change-of-plea hearing, the Associated Press reported.\n Born in Pakistan, Khalid was an honors student living with his family in Ellicott City, outside Baltimore, and planning to attend Johns Hopkins University when FBI agents arrested him in July. He was the youngest terrorism suspect indicted in the United States.\n Defense attorney Jeffrey Lindy declined to comment on the April 2 plea hearing.\n Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Williams did not immediately return a message from the Associated Press.\n Khalid is charged with helping Colleen R. LaRose, 48, of Pennsburg, who used the online name \"Jihad Jane,\" and others raise money and recruits for a Muslim holy war. Khalid had pleaded not guilty in October.\n He and LaRose met online in a jihadist chat room when Khalid was 15, sources told The Inquirer. The indictment said he was actively trying to solicit donations and help plan a jihad.\n \"I have waited for this donation moment for so long,\" said one of his July 2009 e-mails cited in the indictment, \"and I want to make sure that everything is true so that the money reaches the banks for brothers who are true to their intentions and are REAL mujahids not some fbi agents.\"\n LaRose pleaded guilty to related charges last year and is awaiting sentencing.\n\nLoad-Date: March 6, 2012"
