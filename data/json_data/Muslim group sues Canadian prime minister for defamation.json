    "full text": "The National Council of Canadian Muslims is suing Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper for defamation, alleging his spokesman linked the group to terrorism in January.\nThe suit seeks a retraction and $100,000 in damages.\nThe row began when council leaders criticized Harper for including Rabbi Daniel Korobkin, who hosted anti-Muslim bloggers Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer, at an event last fall in Toronto.\nThe prime minister's communications director, Jason MacDonald, responded by saying, \"We will not take seriously criticism from an organization with documented ties to a terrorist organization such as Hamas.\"\nHamas is listed as a terrorist organization in Canada.\nReached by email Thursday, MacDonald, who is also named in the suit, declined to comment.\nThe council wanted to give Harper time to either retract the comments or offer evidence proving them. After receiving neither, the group filed the suit Monday.\nThe council said it has consistently condemned terrorism.\nThe council was affiliated with the Council on American-Islamic Relations and was known as CAIR-CAN until last year, when it changed its name.\nCAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper said a court ruling in favor of the council, which is independent from CAIR in the United States, could have an impact in the U.S.\n\"If the Canadian organization is able to prove there was defamation,\" Hooper said, \"that might make Islamophobes think twice before making this baseless claim.\"\n\nLoad-Date: May 31, 2014"
