Osama: The Making of a Terrorist is Jonathan Randal's study of the situation and restructure of the war in Iraq as a battleground for the soul of the Middle East.\nRandal brings to his book years of personal research and face-to-face reportage about the long history of anti-Western, pro-Muslim gains covering several countries in the Middle East. A former correspondent for one of the most prominent newspapers in the United States, Randal modestly points out that despite constant planning he failed in the first of his objectives: to meet Osama bin Laden and learn his arguments firsthand. Randal covers events of pro-Muslim troublemaking, as it has never been minutely itemized before.\nOSAMA bin Laden obviously didn't simply create himself. He worked endlessly to fit himself into the conservative side of Saudi Arabia and to train others to meet Wahhabism. The wonder is that, despite the absence of royal lineage, he succeeded, wildly.\nStrangely enough, the lack of royal lineage may have worked to bin Laden's benefit. Saudi royalty meant that someone else performed the work, and in this case it was the immigrant. Over time, the immigrant bin Ladens, settled in Jeddah, became the major contractor for the kingdom.\nWhen the Sauds needed a roadway the bin Laden family built it and the kingdom paid for it. \"Awash in petro-dollars,\" the Saudi kingdom had to put its money somewhere, and the bin Laden family cheerfully profited. It was the bin Ladens who gained as the Sauds figured out where the money might go and then the United States would release it.\nAND EQUALLY strangely, it was the conservative radicals, not the U.S., who profited in the end. As the West - Europe and the U.S. - needed more oil to support its industries, so the radically conservative Muslim movement saw advances not only in the West but globally as well.\nOsama bin Laden could hardly do otherwise than profit. As the family wealth grew greater, so did its influence - as did his - in the family, in the kingdom, and also within Islamic conservatism.\nSmall wonder that Osama helped shove his influence along. The steps in nearby Afghanistan and Pakistan were logical. In Pakistan, Saudi Arabia would benefit. In the area as a whole, individual rulers stood to gain. Each, especially Afghanistan, provided training ground for Osama's missions. The U.S. watched a close ally, Pakistan, create an uncertain experiment in democracy whose failure seemed as likely as success.\nAlthough its scope was far beyond anything seen in the recent past, the terrorism of 9/11/01 should not have come as complete a surprise as it did. It was not that new or extensive among U.S. allies in Europe, or, most recently, in the U.S. itself. That it continues, again though on a much smaller scale, deserves continued attention. Randal closes on a clear political note. He fears that it is legitimate to worry that \"the lofty aim of bringing open democratic society to the Muslim world\" by invading Iraq is arrogant./\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO\n\nLoad-Date: September 8, 2004"
