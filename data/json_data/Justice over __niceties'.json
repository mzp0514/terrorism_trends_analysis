    "full text": "Bipartisan legislation passed by Congress would allow victims of 9/11 to sue the Saudi Arabian government. But the bill faces a veto from the White House, which evidently is more concerned over diplomatic niceties than American justice.  \nIf anything, a lawsuit would address any lingering questions of a Saudi government nexus to the Sept. 11 attacks and set the record straight. \nFifteen of the 19 9/11 hijackers were Saudis. Speculation over a government connection was reignited two months ago when Congress released 28 declassified pages from congressional reports, suggesting that some of the attackers had links to the Saudi government. The allegations were never substantiated. \nThe Obama administration has said the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act would imperil longstanding relations with a Middle East \"ally.\" And, supposedly, it would open the door for foreign countries to sue the U.S. \nBut, \"If we're not funding terrorist organizations and killing people, then we don't have anything to worry about,\" says Terry Strada, leader of the 9/11 Families United For Justice Against Terrorism. \nEarlier this year the Saudis threatened to pull billions of dollars from the U.S. economy if the bill becomes law. But Riyadh should have no hesitation to make its case against suggestions of a 9/11 connection in an American court, where, we remind, a defendant is innocent unless proven guilty. \n\nLoad-Date: September 15, 2016"
