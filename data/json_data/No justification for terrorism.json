The TH gave this article such a prominent place in the paper that I wonder if it shares Mr. Whitis' anti-American views.\nI hope not.\nWhat Mr. Whitis' is saying in his article is that America got its just desserts when we lost 6,000 of our citizens in the New York and Washington terrorist attacks. In his article he said that it was retaliation for all America's past bad deeds that caused these terrorist events to happen. He further stated that we had invaded countries to the south of us 50 times in the past 100 years. I'd like to ask Mr. Whitis how many of these countries we occupied.\nIn Mr. Whitis' view, America should be just a few settlements on the East Coast with the rest of the country occupied by the European nations that our early settlers escaped. He spoke of the Philippines being dominated for 100 years by our selected tyrants. Is he saying that we selected Spain to dominate the Philippines from 1525 until 1900 and then they allowed us to take over until 1946 when the Philippines became an independent nation. I spent nine months in World War II effecting the liberation of the Philippine people from Japanese rule. The best thing that ever happened to the Philippine people was when we freed them in 1900 from 375 years of despotic Spanish rule.\nIt is my opinion that Mr. Whitis should move his family to Afghanistan, Iraq, or Iran and then he can assist them in their retaliation attacks against America.\n\nLoad-Date: October 16, 2001"
