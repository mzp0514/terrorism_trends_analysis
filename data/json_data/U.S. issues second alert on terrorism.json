    "full text": "WASHINGTON -- The Clinton administration continued to express\nconcern about possible holiday terrorist incidents Tuesday as\nsecurity was tightened at American airports and for U.S. military\nforces abroad.\nThe State Department, reiterating its warning Dec. 11 to U.S.\nholiday travelers abroad, released new details about a thwarted\nattack on Americans in Jordan.\nAdministration officials again said they have no evidence of any\nspecific terrorist threat at home. They said they were walking\na fine line between responsibly advising the public and creating\na panic.\n\"We have told the American public (traveling abroad) that this\nis a yellow light; it is not a red light,\" State Department spokesman\nJames Foley said.\nDevelopments:\n-- The Federal Aviation Administration said travelers should\nexpect tightened security at airports.\n-- The Pentagon said U.S. military commanders worldwide have\nbeen put on alert.\n-- The State Department issued its second caution for Americans\nabroad in two weeks. A statement Tuesday said 13 suspected terrorists\narrested in Jordan this month were considering attacking Americans\nthere.\nThough that operation was foiled, the statement said, the department\n\"cannot rule out the possibility that attacks still may be planned\nfor this and other parts of the world.\"\n-- In Vermont Tuesday, investigators were trying to determine\nwhether explosives might have been stored in a car carrying an\nAlgerian man who was held Monday by federal agents at a tiny border\nstation.\nThe investigation comes after the arrest last week of Algerian\nAhmed Ressam, who was charged with transporting explosives.\nThe two incidents were not believed to be related.\n\nLoad-Date: December 22, 1999"
