    "full text": "Mohammad Kilany's Aug. 28 letter condemning the American cruise missile strikes on terrorist facilities in Sudan and Afghanistan was more a tawdry display of moral equivalence than a plea for universal brotherhood (\"The Killing of Innocent People in Missile Attacks Hurts U.S. Credibility.\")\nLike other Muslims who join the debate over terrorism and how to respond to it, he pointedly took the United States to task with regard to pinpoint retaliatory actions for which it assumed full responsibility, while he referred to the strictly murderous and often anonymous atrocities of which his co-religionists have been found guilty again and again only in the most general terms.\n(Indeed, the same day Kilany's letter appeared, the Post-Gazette reported that two Arab Muslims had been arrested in connection with the embassy bombing in Kenya.)\nThe remonstrations of Kilany and other Muslims would ring less hollow if, instead of writing letters to the editor, they unambiguously excommunicated members of their own faith who have committed terrorist crimes against civilians.\nIf that proves politically impossible at present, they might initiate the process by (1) openly acknowledging that the Palestinian Arabs chose war against Israel instead of peace with partition in 1948 and that the consequences are largely of their own and of the other Arabs' making; (2) condemning mosque preachers who extol hatred and incite murder; (3) mobilizing everywhere against repressive movements like the Taliban; (4) working for political pluralism and freedom in Muslim countries; and (5) stopping the glorification of bus bombers and tourist murderers as \"martyrs.\"\n\nLoad-Date: September 5, 1998"
