    "full text": "Remember when Benjamin Netanyahu was an impediment to peace?\nViolence was deadlier before his watch - and has been deadlier since his departure - than during his tenure as Israel's prime minister.\nThe Clinton administration not only tilted toward Ehud Barak in Israel's elections but dove into the deep end on his behalf. The White House served as a de facto headquarters for the Barak campaign - complete with advice from James Carville.\nThe administration explained it abstained on a rancid anti-Israel UN resolution because a no vote would have invited terrorism against Americans. Several days after the vote, terrorists attacked a U.S. Navy ship - killing 17 sailors and maiming three dozen.\nBill Clinton is not to be blamed for carnage on board the Cole. Terrorism has occurred during every administration. There is no reason to believe his predecessor would have taken - or his successor will take - a fundamentally different approach. The point is that efforts to appease the unappeasable are futile. America and Israel are targeted not because of what they do but because of what they are.\nThe U.S. considers (considered?) Yasser Arafat a potential peace-maker. His periodic visits to Camp David and the White House receive the royal treatment. He is not a Sadat, a Mandela, or a Gandhi but a malevolent phony.\nThe ongoing events in the Middle East shatter- or should - every illusion shared by doves and accommodationists in Israel and in the United States.\n\nLoad-Date: October 25, 2000"
