    "full text": "After satisfying himself that Western Goals Inc., a militantly anti-Communist educational group, has no ties to the right-wing John Birch Society, Roy M. Cohn said yesterday, he joined the advisory board of the organization.\nWestern Goals, founded three years ago by Representative Larry McDonald, a conservative Democrat from Georgia, has its headquarters in Alexandria, Va.\nAfter satisfying himself that Western Goals Inc., a militantly anti-Communist educational group, has no ties to the right-wing John Birch Society, Roy M. Cohn said yesterday, he joined the advisory board of the organization.Its avowed purpose is to ''track and report incidents of subversion and terrorism and the spread of Communism.'' While Mr. Cohn supports these aims, he has always opposed the Birch Society, an ultraconservative group.\nMr. Cohn, a key aide in the late Senator Joseph R. McCarthy's Communist-hunting campaign of the 1950's, said he had thought over Mr. McDonald's invitation to join the advisory board for two months before accepting.\nMr. McDonald is a member of the governing board of the Birch Society, and several Western Goals members also hold membership in the Birch Society.\nBut, Mr. Cohn said, he was satisfied that Western Goals was not tied to the Birch Society, because the advisory board includes Dr.  Edward Teller, the physicist who helped create the hydrogen bomb, and Roger Milliken, the North Carolina textile executive."
