    "full text": "WASHINGTON â€” In full accord on a global threat, world leaders Tuesday endorsed President Barack Obama's call for securing all nuclear materials around the globe within four years to keep them out of the grasp of terrorists. They offered few specifics for achieving that goal, but Obama declared \"the American people will be safer and the world will be more secure\" as a result.\nObama had called the 47-nation summit to focus world attention on the threat of nuclear terrorism, a peril he termed the greatest threat facing all nations and a \"cruel irony of history\" after mankind had survived the Cold War and decades of fear stoked by a U.S.-Soviet arms race.\nA terrorist group in possession of plutonium no bigger than an apple could detonate a device capable of inflicting hundreds of thousands of casualties, he said.\n\"Terrorist networks such as al-Qaida have tried to acquire the material for a nuclear weapon, and if they ever succeeded, they would surely use it,\" he told the opening session, which convened under tight security at the Washington Convention Center. \"Were they to do so, it would be a catastrophe for the world, causing extraordinary loss of life and striking a major blow to global peace and stability.\"\nThe summit countries said they would cooperate more deeply with the United Nations and its watchdog arm, the International Atomic Energy Agency. They also said they would share information on nuclear detection and ways to prevent nuclear trafficking.\nSeveral countries, including Ukraine, Mexico and Canada, declared their intention to give up highly enriched uranium as a step toward making it harder for terrorist groups or criminal gangs to steal or acquire a key ingredient in the making of atomic weapons. Russia and the U.S. signed a deal to dispose of tons of weapons-grade plutonium, although that won't start for eight years.\nWhile the summit focused on the threat from terrorists, attention was given to Iran, North Korea and other nations who are seeking or have succeeded in obtaining or developing nuclear weapons. Neither Iran nor North Korea was invited to attend the session, which the Obama administration billed as the largest gathering of world leaders on U.S. soil since the U.N. founding conference in San Francisco in 1945.\nThe leaders agreed to hold a follow-up nuclear security summit in South Korea in 2012.\nIn a concluding news conference, Obama said he was confident China would join other nations in pressing for tough new sanctions on Iran for continuing to defy the international community in seeking such weapons.\n\"Words have to mean something. There have to be some consequences,\" Obama said.\nChinese President Hu Jintao met with Obama on Monday, then on Tuesday gave a speech to the group calling for \"effective\" measures to safeguard nuclear weapons and materials. But he stopped short of mentioning Iran's program.\nIran denies it intends to build an atomic bomb, and despite widespread concern about its intentions, Obama is having difficulty getting agreement on a new set of U.N. sanctions against the country. He said Tuesday that Hu had assured him China would participate in drafting sessions at the United Nations on strong sanctions.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nASSOCIATED PRESS President Barack Obama waves after the group photo is taken at the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington on Tuesday. -NOTE-\n\nLoad-Date: April 14, 2010"
