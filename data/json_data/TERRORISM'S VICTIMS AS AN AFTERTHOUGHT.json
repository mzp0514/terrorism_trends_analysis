    "full text": "To the Editor:\nOne reason why terrorism flourishes today, or at least is not less of a problem than otherwise, can be found in the July 29 Op-Ed article on Armenian terrorism by Edward N. Costikyan and Robert H. Tembeckjian. My comments are not directed to them solely; I find their article typical of much published ''informed opinion.''\nThe writers give the following reasons the terrorism should cease: (1) it injures the Armenian image; (2) the Armenians will be no better off; (3) the dispute with Turkey will be more difficult to solve; (4) ''moreover,'' terrorism kills innocent people, and (5) the memory of Armenian victims of the Ottomans will be dishonored.\nOut of five reasons and 13 paragraphs, it is the 12th paragraph and the fourth reason - a ''moreover'' argument - that finally states that terrorism is wrong because it kills innocents. This demotion of the moral wrongness of killing people is symptomatic of a mentality that sees terrorism not as per se evil and unthinkable but as a putative candidate for a political program that, alas, must in the final analysis be rejected as unworkable.\n(Prof.) PETER LUSHING, Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, Yeshiva University, New York, July 29, 1983"
