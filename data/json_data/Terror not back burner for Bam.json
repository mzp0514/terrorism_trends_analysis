    "full text": "WASHINGTON - The Mumbai carnage is a grim reminder to a President-elect determined to make economic recovery his first mission: The scourge of terror doesn't rest for Thanksgiving turkey or presidential transitions.\nAs Barack Obama sat down to celebrate a holiday dinner yesterday at his Chicago home, he had already spoken to Secretary of State Rice for an update on the terror attacks in India. He'd also received an intelligence briefing from U.S. analysts and telephoned the Indian ambassador Wednesday evening to express his sorrow.\nObama frequently reminds the country there's only one President at a time. Yet his predecessor, President Bush, has ordered full cooperation with the government-in-waiting given the unyielding threat of global terror.\n\"The President-elect is also receiving regular situational updates from the State Department Ops Center and the National Counter Terrorism Center,\" Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor said.\nThe Mumbai attacks are even more incendiary because they ratchet up tensions between archenemies India and Pakistan, who both have nuclear weapons and no use for each other. With Indian officials darkly asserting the attackers came from Pakistan - already a haven for Al Qaeda, Taliban fighters and other evildoers - Obama confronts an even more difficult time managing the discord in the world's most volatile region.\nObama and Bush aren't alone among world leaders on guard.\nBritish Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the \"outrageous\" attacks in India would be met with a \"vigorous response.\"\nAnd Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni condemned the attacks, saying it was \"painful testimony that terrorism is the main challenge\" for the international community.\ntdefrank@nydailynews.com\n\nLoad-Date: November 28, 2008"
