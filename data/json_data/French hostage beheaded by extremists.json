It would not immediately comment on the beheading video.\nTerrorism watchdog SITE Intelligence Group distributed a video by Jund al-Khilafah Wednesday announcing Gourdel's death.\nGourdel was a 55-year-old mountaineering guide from Nice seized in mountains of northern Algeria.\nThe video resembled those showing the beheadings of two American journalists and a British aid worker in recent weeks, but instead of showing President Barack Obama, it showed French President Francois Hollande.\nFrance started airstrikes in Iraq on Friday, the first country to join the U.S. military campaign against the Islamic State fighters there.\n\"Our values are at stake,\" French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said Wednesday after hearing about the video. He would not comment further, but minutes earlier he insisted that France would continue fighting in Iraq as long as necessary.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nAssociated Press A group calling itself Jund al-Khilafah, or Soldiers of the Caliphate, with captive French hostage Herve Gourdel.\n\nLoad-Date: September 26, 2014"
