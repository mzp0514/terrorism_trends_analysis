    "full text": "Dear Editor: I am deeply concerned about the conflating of Islam with terrorism.\nUnfortunately, the recently comment by Pastor Bill Campbell of Hendersonville Presbyterian Church in Henderson North Carolina - \"Terrorism is not a religion but the religion that tends to give birth to it these days is Islam\" - is reflective of the misguided views of many of my fellow Christian clergy.\nThe New York Times has reported that since Sept. 11, 2001, nearly twice as many Americans have been killed by white supremacists, antigovernment fanatics and other non-Muslim extremists than by radical Muslims. Not only does blaming Islam misstate the facts, it also minimizes the responsibility that we, as Christians, bear for terrorists like Timothy McVeigh and Dylaan Roof, adding those offenses to the Christian support for the terrorism of slavery. It is ironic that Dylaan Roof, a baptized Christian convicted of the mass murder of nine people in a Charleston church, was arrested less than 60 miles from Pastor Campbell's church.\nThese days it is wise for Christian clergy to remember the question Jesus asked 2,000 years ago: Why do you see the speck in your neighbor's eye, but do not notice the log in your own eye?\nRev.
