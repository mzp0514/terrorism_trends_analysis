    "full text": "The Iraq war and congressional scandals hurt Republican candidates in the midterm elections, as the GOP lost the advantage on their central issue of terrorism, exit polls found.\nThree-fourths of voters said corruption and scandal were important to their votes, and they were more likely to vote for Democratic candidates for the House. Iraq was important for just two-thirds, and they also leaned toward supporting Democrats.\nVoters who said terrorism was an important issue split their support between the two parties.\nWith many voters angry at President Bush and the Republican leadership in Congress, Democrats were winning the vote among several groups that have usually been very closely contested - independents, moderates, the middle class and suburban women, according to exit polls.\nA dozen years after Republicans won the support of middle-class voters, that group came home to Democrats. The middle-class leaned heavily toward the GOP in the last two elections.\nAmong white voters, Democrats and Republicans split the vote for the House - four years after the GOP dominated the white vote. And three-fourths of Hispanics backed Democrats and a fourth backed the GOP - a step backward after Republicans wooed Hispanics during the last few years.\n\nLoad-Date: November 8, 2006"
