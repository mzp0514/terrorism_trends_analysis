The law, enacted after the Sept. 11 attacks to provide insurers a temporary federal backstop, is due to expire at yearend. Two Massachusetts Democrats, House Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank and Rep. Mike Capuano, are expected to unveil a bill today that would extend and revise the program.\nRep. Paul Kanjorski, the Pennsylvania Democrat who chairs the capital markets subcommittee, said in an e-mail to American Banker that he hopes to have a \"vigorous and robust debate about all of the provisions contained in their proposal.\" \nOn June 26 the full committee plans to vote on at least two other pending bills, including one sponsored by Rep. Frank to reform the National Flood Insurance Program. That bill passed the House last year but stalled in the Senate.\nhttp://www.americanbanker.com/            http://www.sourcemedia.com/\n\nLoad-Date: June 15, 2007"
