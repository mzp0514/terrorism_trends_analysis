    "full text": "LONDON -- Three men have been arrested at Heathrow Airport and held on suspicion of ''possessing articles and documents with intent to use them for terrorist purposes overseas,'' the police said on Friday.\nThe suspects, residents of Britain's second-largest city, Birmingham, were arrested Thursday night as they arrived from Oman. The police did not release their names.\nThe three, aged 33 to 39, were detained by officers from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit as part of a ''preplanned and intelligence-led'' operation, the police said, that was not mounted ''in response to any immediate threat to public safety.''\nThey were held under Section 57 of the British Terrorism Act. That law makes it a criminal offense to possess materials that create a ''reasonable suspicion'' that they are ''for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism.''\nA police spokeswoman said British officers had traveled to Oman to meet with the authorities there before making the arrests, but she declined to provide further details about the operation or to describe the articles and documents the men possessed.\nOman, a small Arab nation that borders Yemen and Saudi Arabia, has not previously figured significantly in Britain's long struggle against homegrown groups of Islamic extremists who have roots overseas. Earlier this week the British government rearrested Abu Qatada, a Jordanian-Palestinian militant preacher accused of being one of Al Qaeda's leaders in Europe, and said it would resume efforts to deport him.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: April 21, 2012"
