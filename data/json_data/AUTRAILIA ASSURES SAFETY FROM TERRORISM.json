    "full text": "SYDNEY, Australia -- Australian officials sought to reassure the world Saturday that the Sydney Olympics were safe from terrorist attack after a possible plot against the country's only nuclear reactor was exposed.\nIn the first major security scare for the games, New Zealand police last March stumbled across evidence of a possible plan to attack the reactor.\nThe information was found during an operation in Auckland against a suspected organized crime ring with links to Afghanistan.\nWith the games scheduled to start Sept. 15, officials were quick to say that there was no direct evidence of a terrorist threat. They expressed confidence in the massive security operation headed by the New South Wales state police and including Australian military forces and international intelligence services.\n\"We have been at pains to assure the Australian public and visitors to Australia for the games, that we have put in place the most well-rehearsed and practiced cooperative arrangements between all relevant authorities law enforcement, intelligence security and otherwise,\" attorney general Daryl Williams said.\nInternational Olympic Committee chairman Juan Antonio Samaranch said he was not worried.\n\"I feel calm, although I will feel even more so the day of the closing ceremony,\" Samaranch told Spanish television.\nFour people were arrested, although none was charged with terrorist activities and there was no direct evidence of a terrorist threat. The New Zealand Herald said that those arrested may have been supporters of fugitive Afghanistan-based terrorist Osama bin Laden.\n\nLoad-Date: August 28, 2000"
