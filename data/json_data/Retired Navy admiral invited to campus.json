During his time in the military, he commanded special operations forces at every level, eventually taking charge of the U.S. Special Operations Command. His career included combat during Desert Storm and both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\nBrian Clardy, history professor, said McRaven's lecture will be significant because students will hear about the admiral's experiences in countering terrorism.\nThe speakers of the Presidential Lecture series are letting students know they too are global citizens and should have a vested interest in the outcome of the war on terror and any other mention of foreign policy in the United States.\nMcRaven commanded the troops that captured Saddam Hussein and rescued Captain Richard Phillips. McRaven is also credited with leading the Osama bin Laden mission in 2011.\nClardy said he clearly remembers the fear generated from first the terrorist attacks and how Osama bin Laden projected fear throughout the world.\nMcRaven has been recognized for his leadership so many times that in 2011 he was the first runner-up for TIME magazine's Person of the Year.\n\"When the story about the early part of the 21st century is written, and the story is written about how the United States responded to terrorism, Admiral McRaven is going to be a huge part of that chapter,\" Clardy said.\nIn 2015, the Admiral received the Intrepid Freedom Award for his distinguished service in defending the values of democracy.\n\"[Admiral McRaven] is a true American Patriot and he has a devout love for this country...I think the one thing we should be above all is grateful,\" Clardy said. \"I thank a Veteran every chance I get.\"\nWilliam McRaven's father, Colonel Claude \"Mac\" McRaven, was a 1941 alumnus and a Murray State Athletics Hall of Fame football player and track star, as well as a decorated World War II fighter pilot.\n\"My father was so proud to have attended the school and always talked longingly about the Bluegrass State,\" McRaven said. \"His life, and therefore my life, were shaped in so many ways by what he learned and who he met at Murray.\"\nMcRaven's father was inducted into the Murray State Athletics Hall of Fame in 1975. As a collegian, Claude scored nine touchdowns while gaining Honorable Mention Little All-America honors, as well as selections on the All-Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association and All-Kentucky Intercollegiate Athletic Conference teams in 1938.\nMcRaven has earned 31 badges of honor and written three books detailing the life lessons he and his men learned while overseas.\nClardy said the lecture will focus on McRaven's career and his service to the country.\nTweet\n\nLoad-Date: February 13, 2020"
