    "full text": "To the Editor:\nYour Feb. 25 editorial ''Where Mrs. Thatcher Faltered'' was a thoughtful and challenging treatment of the situation in Northern Ireland.\nWhile I was encouraged that the Prime Minister mentioned the ''Irish question'' in her speech before Congress last week, she offered only a routine denunciation of Irish Republican Army violence.\nIt was disappointing that she failed to examine the relationship between organized violence and the denial of human-rights guarantees to Northern Ireland's nationalist minority.\nThe minority in the British-ruled North is not protected by the safeguards of due process that are the cornerstones of democratic government. They are subjected to illegal strip searches, indefinite detention and nonjury trials. They are discriminated against in employment and housing. They are victimized by British security forces using lethal plastic bullets - ammunition condemned and prohibited in every other Western nation.\nMrs. Thatcher is right to condemn the violence and terrorism we all abhor. But she is unwise to continue neglecting the injustices that fuel conflict in Northern Ireland. The violence she referred to is a symptom of the problem.\nUntil Prime Minister Thatcher is willing to move beyond pat condemnations of I.R.A. terrorism and commit her Government to guaranteeing the legal and civil rights of the minority, the tragedy in Northern Ireland will continue.\n \nROBERT A. BORSKI Member of Congress, 3d Dist., Pa.  Washington, Feb. 27, 1985"
