    "full text": "St. Louis, whose shrunken population excluded it earlier from a federal program to fight domestic terrorism, can expect special firefighter training and equipment after all, officials running the program said Wednesday.\nThe coming federal budget carries $ 300 million in a program to fight domestic terrorism, up from $ 12 million in the current spending year, said Jeffrey A. Hunker, director of the federal Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office.\nAs a result, St. Louis firefighters will get training in how to combat chemical and biological warfare, Hunker said. Later, the city will get special protective gear for firefighters and \"assay kits\" that can detect the nature of potential chemical or biological threats. Training should take place in September, Hunker said. He was unable to say how much federal money will be provided for the training and equipment.\nCity officials were concerned last month when they learned the city was excluded from the program because of its dramatic population drop - to u nder 400,000 from 850,000 in recent decades. The smallest political body that made the cut was Jefferson County, Colo., with 493,000 people. It comprises Denver's western suburbs.\nSt. Louis Fire Chief Neil J. Svetanics said last month that the city's exclusion may hurt its ability to protect Pope John Paul II during his visit, scheduled for January.\nHunker and Richard A. Clarke, national coordinator for security, infrastructure protection and counterterrorism, were in St. Louis on Wednesday to meet with city officials. They also spoke to about 50 members of the Regional Commerce and Growth Association.\nClarke urged a government-business partnership to build readiness against those who might try to cripple utilities, transportation networks, banks and other institutions by interfering with their computers. In the future, American military action abroad might prompt foreign terrorists into attacking computer systems in the United States, Clarke said.\n \nBuilding a 'cyberdefense'\nClarke told the RCGA members he is helping to develop within three years a \"cyberdefense for the nation.\" One method could be to develop software that automatically detects computerized attacks and isolates them.\n \n\"We have ideas; we don't have the answers,\" he said.\nClarke said he is less concerned by the mischief of youthful hackers than he is by the serious threats posed by \"cyberwarriors\" who might have the support of foreign terrorists or drug cartels.\nInternet providers already are alarmed, Clarke said. Recently, an extortionist told an Internet provider in Florida that he would post on the Internet the names and credit card numbers of its subscribers unless the provider sent money to the man's bank account.\nU.S. authorities and German police foiled the plot by finding the extortionist at his computer in a hotel room in Hamburg, Germany, Clarke said.\n\nLoad-Date: July 24, 1998"
