They are ethnic Albanians, and authorities say they are currently illegal aliens.\nShnewer, also of Cherry Hill, is a U.S. citizen who was born in Jordan and came to this county as a child. Tatar, formerly of Cherry Hill but now living in Philadelphia, is a legal resident alien who was born in Turkey.\nThe sixth defendant, Agron Abdullahu, 24, of Atlantic County, N.J., was charged with aiding the Duka brothers in possessing weapons. He came to the U.S. with his family from Kosovo in the late 1990s.\n\nLoad-Date: June 26, 2007"
