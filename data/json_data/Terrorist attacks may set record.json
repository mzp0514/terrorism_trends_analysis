Washington, he said, will not improve ties    with Tehran until such support stops.\n \n     But the ambassador also told reporters that spectacular incidents    such as airline hijackings have gone down during the past two years,    partly due to better airport security and intelligence cooperation by    Western nations.\n \n     Bremer gave no figure on the number of incidents that have occurred    so far in 1988 but said the pro-Palestinian Abu Nidal group has been    responsible for at least five, including attacks on a Greek tourist    boat and a British club in Sudan.\n \n     \"Abu Nidal was out of business for most of 1987\" after being    kicked out of Syria and moving to Libya, Bremer said.\n \n     He said four Americans have died in attacks this year whereas seven    died in 1987, 12 in 1986 and 38 in 1985. Terrorism has not become a    problem in the United States because terrorist groups find it easier to    attack Americans overseas, he added.\n \n  - Information from the Associated Press was used in this report.\n \n    \n\nLoad-Date: November 11, 1992"
