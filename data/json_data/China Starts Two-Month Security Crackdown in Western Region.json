    "full text": "BEIJING -- China announced a two-month ''strike hard'' security campaign on Tuesday in the troubled western region of Xinjiang, with 24-hour police patrols of crowded areas, identity checks, street searches, increased criminal investigations and accelerated trials.\nThe latest mobilization of the region's security apparatus follows a five-week spate of violence that has resulted in at least three dozen deaths. Tensions between ethnic Uighur and Han populations keep parts of Xinjiang on perennial tenterhooks, and the authorities carry out at least one regionwide ''high pressure'' security campaign a year, said Nicholas Bequelin, a researcher for Human Rights Watch in Hong Kong.\nA statement on Xinjiang's Web site said that the latest campaign was aimed at ''destroying a number of violent terrorist groups and ensuring the region's stability.''\nMr. Bequelin said such initiatives typically meant an intensified police presence and mandatory weekend political indoctrination classes for some Uighurs, including teachers. Xinjiang has experienced ''nonstop campaigns against terrorism, separatism and religious extremism since the mid-'90s,'' he added, saying that ''a vicious cycle of repression'' was partly to blame for social unrest.\nThis month, the local authorities in Xinjiang's historic city of Kashgar charged that the leader of one assault had trained in Pakistan, a sign that China is increasingly concerned about whether Pakistan is a haven for Uighur extremists. Pakistan has pledged full cooperation with China in fighting terrorism.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: August 17, 2011"
