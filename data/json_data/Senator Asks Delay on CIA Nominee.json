    "full text": "Citing allegations of improprieties by Bank of Credit and Commerce International, Sen. John Kerry is urging postponement of confirmation hearings on Robert Gates, the President's choice to head the Central Intelligence Agency.\nThe Massachusetts Democrat said Mr. Gates must first answer questions from Mr. Kerry's Foreign Relations subcommittee on terrorism, narcotics, and international operations about agency links to the Luxembourg-based banking empire.\nBCCI operations were seized this month by regulators in eight countries after they found evidence of massive fraud. There have been allegations that the CIA interfered with efforts to close the institution.\nMr. Kerry said Senate investigators learned that in 1988 Mr. Gates, then deputy director of the CIA, provided a memorandum on BCCI to William von Raab, former commissioner of the U.S.  Customs Service. Mr. von Raab, who was conducting a money-laundering investigation, has complained that the information was \"pabulum.\" Two months ago, Mr. Kerry attempted to obtain the same memorandum, but the CIA demurred, saying the document didn't exist.\n\"To date, we still do not have any answers,\" Mr. Kerry said. \"There are significant questions which the CIA should answer before we proceed further with the Gates nomination.\" \nThe American Banker"
