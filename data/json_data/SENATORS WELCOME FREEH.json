    "full text": "SENATORS ASSEMBLED to scrutinize the fitness of U.S. District Judge Louis J. Freeh to become FBI director vied Thursday to see which one could evoke the closest personal association with the nominee.  As a consequence, the former FBI agent and prosecutor appears to be a shoo-in for the job and likely to be confirmed before the end of next week - exactly the speedy action sought by the White House.\nFreeh provided the Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing with promises to fight crime on all fronts while retaining independence from political influence and increasing the number of minority and women agents.  Freeh said the FBI must fight terrorism, drugs and other crime outside the United States as well as domestically.  \"As the 21st century nears, the FBI must become a law-enforcement agency with truly global concerns because so many crimes are now international problems and - like it or not - we live in that global village,\" he said.  \"We need more agents who speak foreign languages and understand other countries and cultures,\" Freeh added.  He said the United States faced a growing threat from terrorism, including possible nuclear attack.  For a nominee's two home-state senators to say nice things about the candidate as a confirmation hearing begins is customary.  But as this hearing opened, the witness table was jammed with five senators: the two Democrats from New Jersey, where Freeh was born and grew up; the Democrat and Republican from New York, where he has worked for years and now lives with his wife and four sons; and Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., who did not claim home-state bragging rights but lauded Freeh's work.  The committee's chairman, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., said he expected Freeh to be approved by tthe full Senate before Aug. 6.\n\nLoad-Date: October 11, 1993"
