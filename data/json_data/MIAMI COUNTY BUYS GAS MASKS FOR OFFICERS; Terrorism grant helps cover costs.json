    "full text": "TROY - The Miami County commissioners Thursday approved the purchase of more than $20,000 in emergency response equipment, including gas masks.\nThe equipment is being bought with part of a $50,000 grant the county received from the federal government as part of a terrorism response preparation program.\nThe program was initiated prior to last September's attacks in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania.\nCommissioner Ron Widener told government students attending Thursday's meeting that equipment is being purchased for emergency workers who would be called immediately if there is a problem. A county terrorism planning committee recommended the purchases. Commissioner Ann Baird said the grant is helping update equipment.\nGrant dollars will be used to buy 10 gas masks for both the sheriff's office and Piqua police, and to reimburse Troy for gas masks already purchased. Six radios and decontamination equipment to be stored in the county hazardous materials vehicle also will be bought.\nIn other business, the commission approved an amendment to the Troy enterprise zone agreement with the former Prestolite Electric Inc., now known as Ameteck Inc. The amendment assigns all tax abatement rights and obligations granted to Prestolite to the new owner. Prestolite was established in 1996 when Prestolite Electric bought Hobart Brothers Co.'s battery charger business.\nContact Nancy Bowman at 335-4357 or by e-mail at nancy_bowman@coxohio.com  \n\nLoad-Date: July 20, 2002"
