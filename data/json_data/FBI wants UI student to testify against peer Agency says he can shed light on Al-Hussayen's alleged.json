Proceeds went to Islamic charities, including some that\n authorities suspect of ties to terrorism.\n The affidavit also alleged that prior to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks,\n extremist ideas were discussed at gatherings at the apartment.\n Scott McKay, an attorney for Al-Hussayen, said he couldn't comment on the\n allegations, but said the apartment also has a pingpong table, a foosball\n table and a kitchen, and is still in use as a gathering place. ''That simply\n is an apartment that Muslim students used in Moscow to meet for social\n reasons,\" McKay said. He said it's been a site for celebrations of everything\n from birthdays to the birth of a child.\n In court papers, authorities said materials sold at the apartment included\n articles and speeches by two radical Saudi sheikhs, Safar Al-Hawali and Salman\n Al-Ouda. Prosecutors say the two sheikhs have links to Osama bin Laden and al\n Qaeda.\n They have sought to connect Al-Hussayen to the two, with such evidence as\n an address book seized from Al-Hussayen's Moscow apartment that included phone\n numbers for both of the sheikhs, and intercepted phone calls and e-mails that\n showed contact with the sheikhs or their associates.\n Al-Kraida, when he was interviewed by authorities last February, indicated\n that he planned to return  to Saudi Arabia after he completed his master's\n degree in agricultural engineering at the University of Idaho. When\n immigration officials checked on his status this month, they learned that he\n had completed his degree requirements and had just moved out of his university\n housing.\n ''Due to Al-Kraida's admitted involvement with the defendant, Sami Omar\n Al-Hussayen, Al-Kraida is believed to be in possession of information germane\n to this matter which will be crucial to the prosecution. It is believed that\n if Al-Kraida travels to Saudi Arabia the United States government will be\n unable to secure his presence at trial via subpoena,\" FBI Special Agent Mary\n Martin said in court documents.\n Accordingly, U.S. Magistrate Judge Mikel Williams issued a summons, and\n Al-Kraida will appear before Williams on Nov. 4 in Moscow to determine the\n conditions under which his presence at AlHussayen's January trial will be\n guaranteed. Al-Kraida also was ordered to surrender his passport.\n ''This was not an arrest warrant,\" noted Jean McNeil, spokeswoman for the\n U.S. Attorney's office in Boise. ''We're not going to ask that he be detained.\n The only reason we're doing it is to ask for conditions of releaseâ€¦ It's\n sort of saying to him, 'Please don't leave the country. Please stick around\n for the trial.\"'\n Al-Hussayen, a 33-year-old doctoral student who had never been arrested\n before last February, remains jailed in solitary confinement in the Canyon\n County Jail. Last month, he requested a contact visit with his wife and three\n young sons, but the court denied the request. Visiting procedures at the jail\n where he's incarcerated require visitors to be separated from inmates by\n security glass, while they talk via a telephone.\n The government has yet to respond to a request by Al-Hussayen's attorneys\n that two top al Qaeda officials, Khalid Sheik Mohammed and Ramzi Binalshibh,\n be brought in to testify in the case. The attorneys argued that since the\n government has identified the two as among the masterminds of the Sept. 11\n terrorist attacks and they're in U.S. custody, they should be asked whether\n Al-Hussayen played any role in the attacks.\n ''If they're truthful, they'll confirm that they've never heard of Sami\n Al-Hussayen,\" McKay said.\n\nNotes\n\nBetsy Z.
