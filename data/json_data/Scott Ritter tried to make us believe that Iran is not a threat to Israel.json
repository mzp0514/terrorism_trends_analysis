    "full text": "I had the distinct displeasure of attending a lecture by Scott Ritter, a former Marine, at West Virginia State University, where he attempted to convince his audience that America is progressing toward fascism, which is a gross exaggeration.\nRitter spoke of an innocuous and docile state that, according to his argument, has not engaged in war for 300 years. His reference was to the Iranian government.\nDoes Ritter not recall the Iran-Iraq War?\nDoes he not recall the American hostages taken during the Iranian Revolution?\nThis qualifies as a peaceful Persia?\nRitter received avid applause when he stated that Iran is not a threat to America. He contended that Iran is 10 years away from acquiring nuclear capability, further commenting that all countries are 10 years away from such capabilities.\nTell that to Uganda.\nHitler was not considered a threat in 1935. The world remained silent, and by 1945 millions were murdered.\nIranian President Ahmadinejad has stated that Israel should be wiped off the map, while antagonizing the West with nationalist rhetoric inciting terrorism.\nWhy should America remain passive until Iran acquires nuclear weapons given its manifest prerogatives?\nAs a Jew, I was offended by Ritter implying that Israel provokes terrorism to gain American intervention.\nDid America provoke the terrorist attacks of 9/11?\nRitter proceeded to call himself a friend of Israel. Well, with friends like Ritter, Israel doesn't need enemies.\nHis most startling statement was denouncing the United States as the chief sponsor of terrorism.\nAustin C. Moore\nSouth Charleston\nMoore is pursuing a doctorate in political science and was a Republican nominee for the House of Delegates in the 30th District.\n\nLoad-Date: November 3, 2007"
