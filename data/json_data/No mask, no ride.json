    "full text": "In the darkest days of April, New Yorkers who don't agree on anything banded together and beat back the beast, as Gov. Cuomo rightly calls the killer coronavirus. We did it by staying apart and wearing masks. And we've kept the monster pinned down, especially in comparison to those unfortunates in the Sun Belt who didn't learn from our struggle.\nBut as we reopen and engage more, we have to keep those mouths and noses covered, and critically, that includes transit, which is seeing growing ridership. It's not up to bus drivers, subway conductors, cops or fellow straphangers to remind us. No mask, no ride. It's the law, and the MTA has to do a better job of letting passengers know that it's not just a suggestion.\nBuses have \"MASKS REQUIRED\" on their large destination signs above the windshield. And there are notices in subway stations and cars. But the easiest thing would be much better and more frequent announcements. We just heard a lousy one on the bus about washing your hands and sneezing into your elbow. It sounds like it's from February. Nothing about mandatory masks.\nCuomo has signed up Chris Rock and Rosie Perez to spread the word about stopping the spread. Let them record funny but forceful messages about wearing masks at all times. Transit is the perfect place for some jokes and some serious shaming. The MTA trademarked the anti-terrorism phrase \"If You See Something, Say SomethingÂ®\" Be clever and memorable. \"Keep It On Or Get Off,\" perhaps?\n\nLoad-Date: July 13, 2020"
