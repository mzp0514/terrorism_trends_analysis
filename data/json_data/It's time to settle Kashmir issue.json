    "full text": "It's time to settle Kashmir issue It is difficult to talk when someone tries to smash your face. Such has been the case of India, the nation that has refused to talk to Pakistan. India has been made to bleed by Pakistani state and non-state actors, along with some misguided Kashmiris. \nIndia does not trust Pakistan on Kashmir until all hostile acts originating from Pakistan stop. After all, Osama bin Laden was found living close to an Army cantonment in Pakistan, a nation whose intelligence services have been fueling the fire of terrorism in Kashmir. Sadly, Pakistan itself has lost hundreds of lives to terrorism after the start of US battles with Taliban. Terrorists kill regardless of what side of the border they are on. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has been named among Time's 100 most influential people while Indian PM Mr. Modi called a great unifier by Time, after his victory in recent elections. It is time for Pakistan to stop supporting terrorism and work with India under Mr. Modi to resolve a contentious issue that has devastated families and economies on both sides of the border for the last 73 years. After the British left India, Indian troops arrived in Kashmir to maintain peace only after Kashmiri leadership signed the letter of accession to India, while militias from Pakistan arrived to brutally take over the entire Kashmir. Plebiscite was never an option due to ethnic cleansing of Kashmiri Hindus. India and Pakistan should accept the existing Line of Control as the international border, give Kashmiris the option to select the country of their choice within 1 year, and open the border for trade and movement of the people. They can live peacefully like US and Canada. After all, both speak the same language, have same culture. Both fought together as brothers for freedom from colonial England.
