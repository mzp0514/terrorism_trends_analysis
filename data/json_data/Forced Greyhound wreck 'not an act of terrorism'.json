He was identified as Damir Igric, a Croatian who entered the United States in Miami in March 1999 with a one-month visa. He boarded the bus in Chicago.\nThe FBI said Igric was apparently trying to take over the bus.\n\"We believe he was acting alone,\" R. Joe Clark, the FBI agent in charge of the Knoxville office, told the AP.\n\"I would say this was a disturbed individual. â€¦ This is not an act of terrorism.\"\nThe driver told authorities the attacker used a box cutter. The driver was treated for a cut to his neck and was stable after surgery, said an official from the Medical Center of Manchester.\nPassenger Kathy Peterson experienced a true rude awakening as the bus crashed while she was sleeping. Peterson, with her right arm slinged, was released from MTMC Wednesday around noon and was brought by wheelchair to her brother-in-law's car and would only say she had been sleeping when the accident occurred.\nThe AP reports that another passenger, Carly Rinearson, made a cellular phone call to Nashville's WTVF-TV and said that a man kept approaching her, asking what time it was. She said the man then asked if he could have her seat, but she refused.\nOf the injured passengers:\n* Nine patients were brought to MTMC and were all in stable condition by noon. Officials from both the FBI and Tennessee Bureau of Investigation interviewed all nine passengers. Those passengers include: Elena, Antionette and Ebony Wilson of Lawrenceville, Ga.; William Price, 29, Leesburg, Ga.; Dawn Ewing, 35, Chicago; Carl Carter, 41, Savannah, Ga.; a 16-year-old female; Peterson, 53, McMinnville, Tenn.; Ricardo Jamal Brooks, 27, Flint, Mich.\n* Four injured passengers were flown by helicopter to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. Their names were not released because family members had not been notified.\nVUMC treated two adult males and two adult females -- with the first patient arriving about 7 a.m. Wednesday.\n\"The patients have a range of injuries that you would expect with a roll-over bus crash,\" said John Morris, director of VUMC trauma center\n\"Three of the four are in stable condition,\" Morris said. \"One is in critical condition.\"\nThe 48-year-old female in critical condition had several injuries and required surgery. Morris would not comment further about her condition.\n* Three patients were treated at Erlanger North Hospital outside of Chattanooga, Tenn. One adult female was listed in critical condition Wednesday afternoon. Another adult female and her child were listed as stable.\n* Four patients were treated at Coffee County Medical Center and released.\n* 12 other injured passengers were taken to various hospitals in the Manchester area.\nEmily Hefter and Mopsy Gascon contributed to this article.\n(C) 2001 Sidelines via U-WIRE\n\nLoad-Date: October 4, 2001"
