Some people who fear the act goes too far and impacts liberties traditionally extended to all Americans would like those provisions to end, while others believe that the act has gone far to increase safety and that it may need to go further to protect citizens.\nThe panel is open to the public.\n\nLoad-Date: March 22, 2005"
