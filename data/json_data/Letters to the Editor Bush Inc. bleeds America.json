    "full text": "6090 S. Rodden Road, Hanover, Ill.\nMembers of Congress never fail to give themselves yearly raises - they automatically vote themselves raises - it's business as usual.\nBusiness is the focal point of Bush, Inc. and the Republican Congress. Cater to business so businesses can grow while stunting the growth of the American people who voted them into office. The minimum wage has not been raised for a decade, but they have no debate on raising the minimum wage?\nThe Bush, Inc. Congress gives itself fiscal security through raises. It gives to itself the \"pork\" that they hope will help them get reelected. We have an administration and a Congress that is bleeding the country and ignoring those who made our country one to be looked at with pride - the American worker.\nIn coming elections, security will not be there for these bleeders because of business-as-usual attitudes.\nBush spouts patience on the \"War on Terror.\" This administration and Congress have declared a \"war\" on the American public, exempting the rich and business from this war.\nTerrorism does not always come from a foreign source - today, terrorism lives in Washington, D.C. Voters should speak up with their only weapon - vote these bleeders out of office.\n\nLoad-Date: July 21, 2006"
