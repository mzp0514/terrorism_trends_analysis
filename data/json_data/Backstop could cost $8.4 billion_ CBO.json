    "full text": "WASHINGTON-The Congressional Budget Office estimates that extending the federal terrorism insurance backstop could cost the government about $8.4 billion from 2008 through 2017, according to an estimate released last week.\nAs approved by the House Financial Services Committee in July, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2007-H.R. 2761-would expand the backstop to include group life insurance as well as commercial property/casualty coverages.\nThe measure also would permit the backstop to cover losses caused by acts of domestic terrorism and would extend the program through 2022.\nThe current program is scheduled to expire Dec. 31.\n``There is no reliable way to predict how much insured damage terrorists might cause in any specific year,'' according to the Congressional Budget Office report.\n``Rather, CBO's estimate of the cost of financial assistance provided under H.R. 2761 represents an expected value of payments from the program-a weighted average that reflects industry experts' opinions of various outcomes ranging from zero damages up to very large damages resulting from possible future terrorist attacks.\n``The expected value can be thought of as the amount of an insurance premium that would be necessary to just offset the government's losses from providing this insurance, although firms do not pay any premium for the federal assistance offered'' by the program, the report states.\nThe report is available at www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/85xx/doc8520/08-02-TRIA.pdf.\n\nLoad-Date: September 15, 2007"
