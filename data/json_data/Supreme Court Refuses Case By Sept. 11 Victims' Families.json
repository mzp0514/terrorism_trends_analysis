    "full text": "The Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear an appeal brought by families and insurers of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, in an effort to link the Saudi royal family to the financing of Al Qaeda and terrorism. \n  The decision lets stand a lower court ruling that found Saudi Arabia and members of the royal family could not be sued in American court because of a 1976 law granting sovereign immunity to foreign countries. \n  The Obama administration angered some victims' families last month by supporting the Saudis' claim to immunity, citing among other factors the significant diplomatic implications raised by the case. \n  Lawyers for the victims' families had wanted the Supreme Court to resolve a split among appeals courts on the question of immunity and allow the suit to move forward based on an exception to the law for countries that sponsor terrorism. Some survivors accused the Obama administration of coddling the Saudis.\n  But the Supreme Court, without comment, refused to intervene in the case.\n  The families will still be allowed to continue with their claims in federal court against a number of Saudi financial institutions, charities and other groups that are not directly tied to the Saudi government or the royal family. Those defendants were not affected by the court's decision not to hear the case. \n  ''We intend to vigorously press those claims and are confident that the presentation of our evidence against those remaining defendants will lead directly back to government offices and royal palaces in Riyadh,'' said Sean Carter, a lawyer with the Philadelphia law firm Cozen O'Connor, which is representing a number of insurance companies that paid billions in claims arising from the Sept. 11 attacks. \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: June 30, 2009"
