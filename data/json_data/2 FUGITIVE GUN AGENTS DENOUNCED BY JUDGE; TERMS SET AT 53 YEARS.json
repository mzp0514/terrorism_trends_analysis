    "full text": "Two men who were convicted in absentia of international trade in weapons with terrorist organizations were each sentenced yesterday to 17 2/3 to 53 years in prison. They are believed to be out of the country.\nThe men, Frank E. Terpil and George Gregary Korkala, were found guilty May 15 in State Supreme Court in Manhattan of 10 conspiracy and weapons charges. According to their lawyers, they have not been heard from since their disappearance just prior to the scheduled start of their trial last September.\n2 fugitive gun agents denounced by judge; terms set at 53 years\nIn sentencing them, Acting Justice Thomas B. Galligan said: ''These defendants trade in death and destruction. That is their business. They have no allegiance to any flag. They prosper in a world at war. Wherever terrorism and torture are, there they are.''\nThe judge recommended that, if caught, the two not be released from prison ''one minute'' earlier than 53 years.\n \n'Offensive to the Norm'\nHe said that because the men were ''so offensive to the norm that civilized people respect,'' it is ''perhaps a blessing'' that they are not in New York. He added, ''But they are so devious and their thinking so warped that while they are at liberty, civilized people are at jeopardy.''\nMatthew Crosson, the assistant district attorney who handled the prosecution, had sought a minimum term of 17 2/3 years and a maximum of 53 years - the most the law allows - after characterizing the two men as ''profiteers of terrorism.'' He had pointed out that Mr.  Terpil had operated a training school for terrorists in Libya and had been ''the right-hand man'' of Idi Amin, the deposed President of Uganda.\nAccording to Mr. Crosson, Mr. Terpil had assisted Mr. Amin in the ''oppression'' and ''murder'' of millions of Ugandans. He produced a copy of a contract in which Mr. Terpil agreed to supply the Ugandan President with equipment useful in torture, as well as electronic surveillance and explosive devices.\nThe attorneys for the two men had opposed a trial in absentia and voiced their opposition to the sentencing proceeding yesterday."
