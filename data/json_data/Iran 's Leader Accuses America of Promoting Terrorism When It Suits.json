    "full text": "Iran's top leader said yesterday that by striking a ceasefire with an Iranian opposition group, America was demonstrating it believed the only bad terrorists were those who were not its \"servants.\"\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei told state-run Tehran Radio that America and the world had recognized the Mujahedeen Khalq as terrorists.\n\"Now, America supports them. It shows terrorism is bad if terrorists are not America's servants,\" he said.\n\"But if terrorists become America's servants, then they are not bad. It's a test, showing how America ridicules fighting terrorism and democracy,\" Mr. Khamenei said.\nAmerica signed a truce on April 15 with the Iraq-based Mujahedeen Khalq, also known as the People's Mujahedeen, allowing the group to keep its weapons to defend itself against Iranian-backed attacks.\nThe State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Cofer Black, described the agreement yesterday, as \"a prelude to the group's surrender.\n\"This is a pretty special group,\" he said in Washington. \"They're a foreign terrorist organization. They are not well liked in Iraq. They could not be put with a general prisoner population. They are following the orders of the coalition commanders, and their situation will be addressed in the coming days and weeks.\"\nIn the past, America called the Mujahedeen Khalq a terrorist organization.\n\nLoad-Date: April 21, 2004"
