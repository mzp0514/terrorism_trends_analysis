    "full text": "To the Editor:\nAt a cost of millions of dollars and an indeterminate number of lives, we demonstrated to the Libyan people our ability to hit - and hurt - them at any time.\nI would have done it differently.\nConsider this scenario: It's just after dark in Tripoli. Crowds throng the streets. Shops, coffeehouses and bazaars are crowded and busy. Suddenly, a blinding flash turns night into day. Eyes dazzled, people mill about in near-panic. The light fades, darkness returns and a distant ''boom!'' Then, drifting out of the night sky like falling leaves, come leaflets - far too many for even the most zealous of police forces to gather before the people do. Printed in Arabic, they carry news and photos of victims of terrorism around the world.\nJust one leaflet-spreading flash ''bomb,'' dropped by a plane flying so high and so fast that it can't be seen, can't be heard and can't be hit by any antiaircraft missile. Night after night after night this goes on - the flash, the boom and the leaflets. Always the leaflets, spelling out the acts of terrorism, the aggression against hitherto peaceful neighbors and the vast sums of money spent on offensive weapons at a time when poverty stalks the land - and constantly reminding the people how easily a shower of leaflets could have been a rain of real bombs. GEORGE W. EARLEY Bloomfield, Conn., April 17, 1986"
