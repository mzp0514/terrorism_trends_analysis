Humanity is synonymous with equality,\" she said. \"We can't have one without the other.\"\n\"I am an Islam Jordanian mother with faith and hope for a better future for mankind,\" she said. \"It is time for finger-pointing and historical differences to be set aside. Change starts with you, if you're willing to sacrifice,\" she said.\n\"All religions are peaceful by nature, but exploited by a few fanatics and their acts. The Muslims are no different,\" she said. \"I am proud to be a Muslim.\" --\nThe princess said each person can help make the world a place where terrorists have no hold. She called for dialogue and acceptance of culture, faith and religion to release the good force of humanity and make this new millennium a better one. \"We must shift our mode of thinking from states and nations to a global community,\" she said.\nHussein, born in 1968, has five brothers and six sisters. She went to college in California, joined the Jordanian special forces and was the first female from the Middle East to complete five military parachute jumps and earn her wings. She has a graduate degree in modern Middle East studies and is the director of women's affairs in the Jordanian forces.\nE-mail: dougjenevans@attbi.com  \n\nLoad-Date: March 2, 2002"
