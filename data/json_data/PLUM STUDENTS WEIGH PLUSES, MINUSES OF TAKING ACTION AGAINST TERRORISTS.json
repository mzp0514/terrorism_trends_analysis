Not as many Americans were killed in Afghanistan, but Clinton was so quick to strike.\nWas it in America's interest to bomb Afghanistan, or was it to get the heat off of Clinton?''\n \nPaul Letzetter, 17\n''I guess you could classify it as a significant step toward combating terrorism, but the motives behind such action seem diluted. The attack was more than warranted, and the message to terrorists worldwide was very clear. However, the use of military force to divert the public's attention from domestic moral issues doesn't sit well with me.''\n \nTom McCarthy, 18\n''No, because I don't think violence really solves anything. I'm sure that we could have responded differently than just bombing them back. That really didn't solve anything.''\n \nBecky Paul, 15\n''By bombing them, we are stooping to their level. It would have been better to talk things out with them, and then hopefully innocent people wouldn't have died.''\n \nChristina Pampena, 15\n''Absolutely. Terrorists don't really respond to much reason and logic. This was a good way to get their attention.''\n \nJohn Ajay, 17\n''No, because I believe it has made the problem worse. Since we have bombed the terrorist bases, we have just fueled their reasons for hating us. Also, now they wish to spread their anti-American feelings across the Middle East.''\nDoug Russell, 16\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTOS (6), PHOTOS: (no caption for any)\n\nLoad-Date: September 17, 1998"
