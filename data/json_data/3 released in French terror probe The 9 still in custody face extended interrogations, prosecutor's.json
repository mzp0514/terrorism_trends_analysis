    "full text": "French police have released three female suspects from questioning, but will keep nine other people in custody as part of an anti-terror investigation connected to last week's attacks in Paris that have put Europe on high alert, officials said Sunday.Amid heightened European vigilance, a far-right rally in Germany planned for today was canceled over a terrorism threat; Italy said it had expelled nine suspected jihadis since December, and Britain's home secretary called for new action to fight anti-Semitism in the wake of the Paris attacks.Authorities in Belgium, meanwhile, asked Greek counterparts to extradite a man detained in Greece a day earlier in connection with a probe of a suspected plot to kill police in Belgium.  Police in at least four European countries arrested dozens of suspects in recent days in an anti-terrorism crackdown sparked by last week's bloody rampage in and around Paris. Brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi and their friend, Amedy Coulibaly, killed 17 people at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, a kosher grocery and elsewhere.In Paris, prosecutor's office spokesman Denis Fauriat said nine suspects among a total 12 rounded up Friday were facing extended interrogations for the next two days, a step allowed under tough French anti-terror laws enacted largely after bombings and other terrorism years ago in the nation.Fallout from the Paris attacks has spread. \nDemonstrations in support of the slain Charlie Hebdo journalists have been held in countries from the United States to Brazil, and violent protests against the magazine's depictions of the Prophet Muhammad have taken place in Niger, Pakistan and Algeria - countries with large Muslim populations.\nNiger's president said Saturday that at least 10 people were killed in violent protests in the West African nation over Charlie Hebdo's depiction of the Prophet Muhammad. \n\nLoad-Date: January 19, 2015"
