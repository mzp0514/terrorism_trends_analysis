    "full text": "The Dec. 26 letter by Jacquelyn Adamiak, \"Liberal Disconnect,\" is laughable! In true neo-conservative fashion she ignores, remolds and inserts what she pleases to show an \"evil\" liberal conspiracy to let America be toppled. Jackie, you deserve a medal! Like so many other neo-cons you have uncovered our sinister plot. Hopefully we have time to slip this global-warming hogwash past the American public before our proven saviors on the right have time to thwart our attempts to let terrorists take over the country and turn it into an anarchist colony.\nOn a more serious note ... I ask any citizen to show me hard proof that any liberal has said terrorism is not a threat, as Ms. Adamiak has suggested. Many liberals and conservatives believe that terrorism is not our country's greatest threat. They have acknowledged that it is a threat, though. Even conservative Colin Powell stated that terrorism is not a mortal threat (GQ Magazine, Sept. 11, 2007).\nSo you and the other neocons can sit in your living rooms and tremble with fear. I will carry on my life as best as I can with what liberties I have left and celebrate how great our country is because of evil liberal accomplishments. In case anyone out there has forgotten what those are, please allow me to remind you: The GI Bill, the Fair Labor Standards Act (the right to overtime and the abolishment of child labor), the Public Health Service Act, the Peace Corps, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Emancipation Proclamation, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Meat Inspection Act of 1906, the Nineteenth Amendment (women's suffrage), the Family Medical Leave Act, the Consumer Products Safety Commission, the Social Security Act. And many, many more.\nI truly should be ashamed to be a liberal.\n\nLoad-Date: January 3, 2008"
