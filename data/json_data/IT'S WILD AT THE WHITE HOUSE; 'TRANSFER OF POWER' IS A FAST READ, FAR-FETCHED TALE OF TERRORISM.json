    "full text": "Here's the scenario.\nA group of terrorists take over the White House and force President Robert Hayes into a newly built underground bunker.\nThe terrorists have a safe-cracker as part of their ensemble and he immediately sets to work trying to blow the door of the bunker.\nThe country is now effectively in the hands of Vice President Sherman Baxter, an idiot. Baxter starts negotiating with the terrorists, offering to give them what they want if only they will release hostages.\nMeanwhile, Baxter's chief of staff, Dallas King, goes about giving away national secrets in order to lure women to his bedroom. He thinks things would improve greatly if the terrorists could manage to kill the president.\nBut, that's not all. Not by a long shot. Mitch Rapp, the CIA's counter-terrorism expert, sneaks his way into the White House, avoids the terrorists (even though he kills a few of them) and rescues a female reporter, who causes all sorts of problems in the beginning but ends up being useful (because she has small hands).\nBy now, you can see that the plot of ''Transfer of Power'' is a little far-fetched.\nFlynn does know the genre, however. His plot moves fast. The characters are believable -- once you accept the premise that a small group of terrorists could seize the White House -- and there is enough violence to keep most of us reading on.\n''Transfer of Power'' is one of those books that seems written mainly to be sold as a movie. It's good summer reading -- but you might really want to see Tom Hanks playing the CIA guy. Transfer of Power by Vince Flynn. Pocket Books: $  24\n\nLoad-Date: July 20, 1999"
