    "full text": "To the Editor:\nIn ''A Round for Civilization'' (editorial March 22), you maintain, ''Notably, democracies have not been goaded into tearing up their own laws to unravel the terror network.'' In the case of Northern Ireland, at least, might not the so-called ''terror network'' exist in response to decades of injustice under a regime that is now being propped up by Britain's army of occupation?\nLetter from Brendan Moore discusses counter-terrorism in Northern Ireland.\nEngland's own Bennett Report (March 1979) underscored the effectiveness of juryless trials for ''suspected'' terrorists - a staggering conviction rate of 93 percent. The Emergency Provisions Act and the Prevention of Terrorism Act allow suspects to be held incommunicado for up to seven days, with no access to a lawyer. The celebrated Bobby Sands was serving a 13-year sentence merely for being found in the same car with a gun.\nHow far can a government go before its forceful policies become extreme and its short-term emergency measures turn repressive? Do genuine criminals and murderers starve themselves to death because they take offense at being labeled as such? Do men and women resort to bombs and bullets if the system is actually working for all segments of the society?\nAssassinations and bombings in Northern Ireland are the symptoms, not the problem.\nBRENDAN MOORE, Blue Point, L.I., March 23, 1982"
