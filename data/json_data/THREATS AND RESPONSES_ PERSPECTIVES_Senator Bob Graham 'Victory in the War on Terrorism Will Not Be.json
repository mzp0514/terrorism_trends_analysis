How is your world view different today from what it was on Sept. 10?\nA. September the 11th confirmed what many had been saying before that date, and that is that in the post-cold-war era that terrorism was going to be our major security threat. I have served on a commission established by the Kennedy Center under its executive director, Graham Allison, studying the issue of security threats to the United States, and we have consistently identified, after the stockpile of weapons within the former Soviet Union, that the next major threat to the United States was international terrorism.\nI had just come back a few days before September the 11th from a trip visiting a number of U.S. stations which have as one of their primary responsibilities international terrorism, including in Pakistan, where we had had an opportunity to visit the Khyber Pass, which was as close as Americans could get to Afghanistan in August 2001, and meeting with President Musharraf and with the head of the Pakistani intelligence service. While we were meeting with the head of the intelligence service, a general whose name was General Ahmed, he had indicated he would be in Washington in early September, we -- Porter Goss, myself -- had invited him to meet with us while he was there. It turned out that the meeting was a breakfast the day of September the 11th.\nSo we were talking about what was happening in Afghanistan, what the capabilities and intentions of the Taliban and Al Qaeda were from the perspective of this Pakistani intelligence leader, when we got the notices that the World Trade Center towers had been attacked.\n\nQ. So you had a more of an inkling than most people that something like this was possible due to your job, but still you couldn't have anticipated that it would happen.\n\nA. Yeah, we had had no briefings either in the United States or in our just-concluded trip that indicated the immediacy or any of the specificity of what happened on September the 11th.\n\nQ. But to you, probably less so than other people, it wasn't that surprising.\n\nA. The fact that something like Sept. 11 occurred and that it occurred in the United States was not a stunning development. The fact that we were vulnerable to this had been anticipated. The actual details, the sophistication and the carnage, the loss of life that occurred, were stunning.\n\nQ. The fact that you had no briefings or warnings, now looking back and you see what kind of evidence was around, was there an intelligence failure?\n\nA. Well, that's one of the major questions that our joint inquiry is targeted to answer. I would defer a final answer until we have completed our review.\n\nQ. How do you feel as an American? Do you feel less secure? How has your personal view of the world changed? Is there a vulnerability there now that. . . .\n\nA. I don't believe the vulnerability has changed. In fact, in some important areas we are more secure than we were a year ago. First, because now the awareness of the reality of international terrorism is known by all Americans and has increased their alertness. Second, in areas, particularly those that have been exploited by the terrorists, such as airports, commercial airlines and bioterrorism, we have made some steps and are committed to even further steps that will increase their security.\nI have a couple of concerns. One is that we cannot fall into the trap of waiting until a vulnerability has actually been assaulted before we start to harden against that assault. One of my principal concerns, which goes back several years, has been seaports, which have been in recent history used for a variety of illicit acts and are, in my judgment, a very attractive means by which a terrorist could attack the United States with weapons of mass destruction. In my judgment we have inadequately responded to the threat of terrorism through seaports, in large part because nobody has ever attacked us through seaports yet.\nThe second concern I have is that we don't overestimate the degree of security that will come from the steps that we have taken and steps that will be taken with the new Department of Homeland Security. It is important that we try to secure ourselves as well as possible. But victory in the war on terrorism will not be won on the defensive, by building castles around our vulnerabilities. Victory is going to be won on the offensive, going to where the terrorists are and aggressively taking them on. \nThis leads to my concern that we've been bogged down in Afghanistan now for about the last five or six months. Military leaders describe our efforts there as being a manhunt, or mopping-up operation. I think that we need to have an aggressive war plan that goes beyond Afghanistan where we go next in taking on and taking out the terrorists.\n\nQ. So you think that Iraq is a good target?\n\nA. It would not be my priority in terms of the war on terrorism. When this war started, the president laid out some standards by which we would judge whether a nation was a terrorist nation. One of those was complicity in September the 11th. Another was that they were providing sanctuary, safe haven, for international terrorist groups. By those two standards, Iraq does not make it very high on the list of a terrorist state. My own target over the next period would be twofold. One, those other countries which have significant Al Qaeda cells, and second, the training centers where the next generation of international terrorists are being prepared in the skills of the terrorist.\n\nQ. So where are those?\n\nA. Those are primarily in Syria, in the Syrian controlled-areas of Lebanon and in Iran.\n\nQ. When your grandchildren are adults, is this still going to be a threat facing the United States?\n\nA. Yes, hopefully a diminished threat. I would use the analogy of America's war against organized crime. For a quarter of a century, organized crime was increasing its influence in the United States, but was not thought of as a major national issue. After World War II, the nation decided that it had had its stomach full of organized crime and was prepared to do some serious assaults, particularly from the federal level. So things like passing the RICO type laws, strengthening the laws through laws through the Internal Revenue Service to go after the profits of organized crime, and a much tougher effort by the F.B.I. and other federal enforcement agencies in conjunction with state and local law enforcement have now substantially diminished but not eliminated the influence of organized crime in the United States. I think that's the pattern we might see on a global basis against international terrorism over the next generation or two you will see a diminution in their influence but not a total elimination.\n\nQ. Are our intelligence agencies, are they too -- parochial maybe is the word -- fragmented. . . .\n\nA. If I could go back and add another paragraph to that last one. I think the key to whether we can accomplish this diminution of international terrorism is: stay the course, keep focused on what our primary objective is -- the elimination of international terrorism. Avoid the allure of distractions. At this point, I think Iraq is a primary distraction from achieving our goals or reducing the threat of international terrorism.\n\nQ. So are our intelligence agencies the way they are set up right now, are they going to be capable of accomplishing what you just laid out?\n\nA. They are better than they were a year ago, they are not as good as they are going to need to be. We are going to need to change the capabilities of our intelligence collection. During the cold war we became very reliant on technologies, particularly satellite-based intelligence collection systems. In this war on terrorism it's going to be back to the old human factor. We are going to have to have spies, either those that are our direct agents or people that we hire for a particular job who can get inside these international terrorist organizations, find out what they're planning to do, and give us enough lead time that other law enforcement and even military units can disrupt the terrorists before they can strike.\nOrganizationally, there have been barriers erected that have frustrated the flow on information from one agency to the other. You asked earlier about -- was there enough information before Sept. 11 to possible have avoided it. We'll give a more definitive answer to the question when we have completed our review. But at this stage I would say we had significant blocks of information, but those blocks never got before a single set of eyes who could analyze them and put them together and see what the pattern that was emerging from those individual blocks. That's going to be a very big challenge to see that we can break down our organizational and cultural resistance to achieve the purpose of getting maximum value out of the intelligence that we collect.\n\nQ. Do you have any second thoughts now about this leak investigation?\n\nA. No, I think, given the factual circumstances, which were that there's an allegation that out of a closed hearing classified information had been given to one or more reporters. The people who were in the room at that closed investigation including the members and staff of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, the staff of the joint investigative committee, members of executive agencies and members of several of the intelligence agencies. In my judgment it was -- the better course of action was to have one investigation that could look at all of those possible sources of the leak, and do so in as professional and expeditious a way as possible, and the judgment of the leadership of the two committees was that the best choice for that was the Department of Justice. . . .\n\nQ. Was Congress at fault at all on Sept. 11?\n\nA. If we had provided more resources to the intelligence community -- we have already started pushing some of the reforms that will get more impetus than now, such as increasing the recruitment and training and diversification of our human intelligence capabilities, strengthening the national security agency's technology to be able to do better signals and eavesdropping intelligence. Those are all measures that our two committees have been advocating for several years, and in fact the irony is the day before Sept. 11, on September the 10th, I had spent, on our authorization bill that we had just plussed up the funding for a number of these areas. . . .\n\nQ. Do you think this is the most important work that you've done since you've been in Congress?\n\nA. I think I define our responsibility as trying to use the knowledge that we can gather from this tragic event on September the 11th to reform our intelligence capabilities to meet the challenges of the 21st century. The answer to your question is yes, I think it's the most important assignment that I've had since I've been a U.S. senator.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPhoto (Carol T.
