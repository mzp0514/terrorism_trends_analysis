Most of the cases were far removed from the headlines generated by terrorism defendants like John Walker Lindh and Zacarias Moussaoui.\nFederal prosecutors \"are being a lot less picky than in the past,\" said David Burnham, co-director of the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse, the research group that compiled the report. \"They're casting a much wider net, and they're getting a lot more fish. What's not clear, though, is whether they're getting the sharks or not.\"\nThe Justice Department, which has questioned the methodology used by the Syracuse researchers in the past, refused to comment on today's findings. The department, officials said, \"has been fully cooperative with Congress\" in providing information about terrorism prosecutions.\nSenator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he was troubled by the Syracuse report. \n\"It raises questions about whether too many resources are being tied up on minor cases that have nothing to do with terrorism,\" Mr. Leahy said. \nSenior members of Congress have complained that the Justice Department has not provided such statistics on its own, making it difficult for lawmakers and the public to gauge the success of the Bush administration's efforts to rein in terrorists.\nThe Syracuse researchers have been a perennial thorn in the side of the Justice Department, bringing three lawsuits against the department in the last six years to gain access to data on investigations and prosecutions. Mr. Burnham's group won access in federal court to information that was previously off limits, but the Justice Department has now sought to scale back the material it provides, triggering a new lawsuit by the group.\nThe numbers in the study released today, which included raw data on criminal cases but no actual names, represent a mixed bag for the Justice Department.\nThe data suggests, on one hand, that the Justice Department is taking a more aggressive and wide-ranging approach to investigating and prosecuting cases it has classified as related to terrorism or domestic security.\nMore than 20 federal agencies are referring cases related to terrorism to federal prosecutors -- an area once dominated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the data showed. Federal lawyers are accepting cases for prosecution much more frequently and are often working to speed them through the courts. In 2002 such cases were typically disposed of in two months, compared with about a year in 2001. \nAt the same time, however, the length of sentences for those convicted dropped precipitously, and terrorism and related cases still represent only 1.3 percent of all federal prosecutions. \nAlthough that percentage grew last year, it is still dwarfed by the number of federal prosecutions in cases related to drugs, immigration and white-collar crime. Researchers said the numbers called into question the Bush administration's effectiveness in making terrorism the main priority of federal law enforcement agencies.\nAttorney General John Ashcroft has said he wants the Justice Department to go after terrorists in the same way Attorney General Robert Kennedy went after the Mafia in the 1960's -- by prosecuting them for the smallest of offenses, even \"spitting on the sidewalk.\"\nOne crucial tactic in fighting terrorism, says Michael Chertoff, the assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division, is to shut down the infrastructure of people who provide fake documents, illegal money transfers and other tools employed by terrorists.\nThe Syracuse data indicates that prosecutors are following through on their pledge. Terrorism-related investigations produced 220 prosecutions for identity theft and 241 for immigration violations, among other smaller scale offenses. The sentences in such cases often totaled just a month or more.\nBut civil rights activists and some Democrats in Congress say the wide net that the Justice Department has cast has unfairly swept up hundreds of people who may have little or no direct link to terrorists. \nThe data showed a wide disparity in how regions prosecuted cases in terrorism investigations.\nNorthern Virginia, with a series of arrests for document fraud and financial crimes, led the way with 189 prosecutions last year, compared with 17 the year before. But the Southern District of New York -- traditionally a hot spot for terrorism investigations -- had only nine such prosecutions last year, compared with six in 2001, the data showed.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \nChart: \"Shifts in Terrorism Prosecutions\"A new study of federal prosecutions for terrorism and internal security cases shows that the number of prosecutions increased tenfold in the 2002 fiscal year, to 1,208 from 115 the previous fiscal year. The median sentence fell to 2 months from 21 months. The largest percentage of prosecutions were for offenses related to international terrorism, and many agencies that previously had little involvement in terrorism referred cases for prosecution.
