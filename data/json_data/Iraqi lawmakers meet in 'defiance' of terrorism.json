    "full text": "Iraq's parliament met in an extraordinary session of \"defiance\" Friday, the Muslim day of prayer, and declared it would not bow to terrorism. A bouquet of red roses and a white lily sat in the place of Mohammed Awad, the lawmaker killed in the parliament dining hall suicide bombing claimed by al-Qaida.\nParliament speaker Mahmoud al-Mashhadani opened the session and asked lawmakers to recite verses from the Quran in honor of Awad, whom he called a \"hero.\"\nThe unprecedented Friday meeting was called to send \"a clear message to all the terrorists and all those who dare try to stop this (political) process, that we will sacrifice in order for it to continue,\" said al-Mashhadani, a Sunni Muslim.\nAn al-Qaida-led amalgam of Sunni insurgents claimed one of its \"knights\" carried out Thursday's suicide bombing in Baghdad's Green Zone and warned the \"monkeys in parliament\" to brace for more attacks. The U.S. military revised the death toll sharply downward, saying one civilian was killed. Late into Thursday the military had said eight people were killed and 23 wounded.\nWhile the attack was widely believed to have been an al-Qaida mission, investigators said Friday they were focusing on security guards inside and outside the parliament building. Iraq's Shiite-dominated Interior Ministry, which runs the police and national paramilitary force, on Friday took over security for parliament.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nAP photo\n\nLoad-Date: April 24, 2007"
