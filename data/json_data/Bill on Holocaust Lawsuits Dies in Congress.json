    "full text": "A bill that would have allowed a New Jersey man who survived the Holocaust to sue the German Government for reparations failed to pass the United States Senate before Congress adjourned last weekend.\nA revised version of the bill passed the House in a voice vote, but did not reach the Senate floor for a vote before adjournment.\nAs originally introduced, the bill would have allowed any American who was a victim of genocide, torture or state-sponsored terrorism to sue the foreign government responsible. But the bill was revised to limit the right to sue to the victims of genocidal acts during World War II.\nThe bill was seen as the last hope for the New Jersey man, Hugo Princz, who spent more than three years in Nazi concentration camps and has spent years seeking reparations from Germany, which has paid out billions to Israel and to other individual Holocaust victims.\nMr. Princz, who lives in Highland Park, was born in Slovakia to a naturalized American father. His parents, sister and two brothers all perished in concentration camps during World War II.\nGermany rejected Mr. Princz's claims because he was never considered a German citizen or a refugee and had not been registered as a Holocaust victim, since he was sent directly to an American hospital after his liberation in 1945.\n\nLoad-Date: October 11, 1994"
