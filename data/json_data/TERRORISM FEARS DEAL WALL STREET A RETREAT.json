    "full text": "The election of an anti-war government in Spain further unnerved the stock market yesterday, propelling the Dow Jones industrial average more than 130 points lower on fears that terrorists, emboldened by the events in Spain, would strike again.\n \"The Spain elections certainly have some ramifications on the war on terror, and the political implications aren't great for the U.S.,\" said Jay Suskind, head trader at Ryan Beck & Co.\n\"Put that together with the lousy week we had last week, and there's not much confidence in buying.\"\n The past week's sell-off brought an end to the market's yearlong rally, which had started to taper off in mid-February.\n The Dow fell 137.19 to 10,102.89, its biggest drop since the 160.07 it lost March 10.\n The Standard & Poor's 500 index was down 16.08 at 1,104.49, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 45.53 to 1,939.20, the biggest drop since Feb. 4.\n The Dow and Nasdaq were at their lowest levels since mid-December, while the S&P 500 was at its lowest level since late December.\n Declining issues outnumbered advancers by more than 3 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume came to 2.02 billion shares, compared with 1.76 billion Friday. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller companies, fell 15.89 to 566.95.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO: Ralph Orlowski/Bloomberg News: SOMBER STOCKS/A trader on the Frankfurt, Germany, stock exchange looks on yesterday as he commemorates the victims of the Madrid, Spain, March 11 bomb blasts on the trading floor.
