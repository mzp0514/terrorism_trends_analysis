Opening a three-day visit to India, Clinton sought to emphasize common interests, symbolized by the terrorist attacks in this seaside city last November that killed 166 people. \"It must be stopped,\" she said, adding that the United States cannot do it alone. \nPart of the backdrop to Clinton's visit is a sense of unease among Indians that the Obama administration is focusing more on its anti-terror campaigns in Afghanistan and Pakistan, at the expense of attention to the world's largest democracy. Clinton is the highest-ranking administration official to stop in India, where she has been widely popular since visiting as first lady in the 1990s. Showing no visible effects from elbow surgery in mid-June, Clinton met with business leaders, was serenaded by female entrepreneurs and participated in a televised discussion at a college on what's wrong with education in India and the U.S. It was the first event of her day, however, that underscored most strongly the central message she carried from Washington. \"The bottom line for me is, our government is committed in the fight against terrorism,\" she told reporters at the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower after meeting privately with a group of survivors of last year's attacks on the Taj and an adjacent hotel. \"And we expect everyone\" who shares the American desire to end violent extremism \"to take strong action to prevent terrorism from taking root on their soil and making sure that terrorists are not trained and deployed - and we believe that around the world.\"\n\nLoad-Date: July 21, 2009"
