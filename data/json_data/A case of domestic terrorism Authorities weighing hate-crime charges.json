That shooter was killed by police. Together the two assaults wounded more than 50 people, some of them critically, and shocked even a nation that has grown accustomed to regular spasms of gun violence. \nInvestigators focused on whether the El Paso attack was a hate crime after the emergence of a racist, anti-immigrant screed that was posted online shortly beforehand. Detectives sought to determine if it was written by the man who was arrested. The border city has figured prominently in the immigration debate and is home to 680,000 people, most of them Latino. \nUsing a rifle, the El Paso gunman opened fire in an area packed with as many as 3,000 people during the busy back-to-school shopping season. \nFederal officials were treating the attack as a domestic terrorism case, according to the U.S. attorney. The Justice Department was considering federal hate-crime charges that would carry the death penalty. \nDespite initial reports of possible multiple gunmen, the man in custody was believed to be the only shooter, police said. \nLaw enforcement officials identified him as 21-year-old Patrick Crusius from Allen, a Dallas suburb which is a nearly 10-hour drive from El Paso. He was arrested without police firing any shots, authorities said. There was no immediate indication that he had an attorney. \nEl Paso Police Chief Greg Allen said the suspect was cooperative and \"forthcoming with information.\" \n\"He basically didn't hold anything back. Particular questions were asked, and he responded in the way that needed to be answered,\" Allen said. \nEl Paso police said they did not know where the weapon was purchased. Allen acknowledged that it is legal under Texas law to carry a long gun openly in a public place. \n\"Of course, normal individuals seeing that type of weapon might be alarmed,\" but before he began firing, the suspect was technically \"within the realm of the law,\" Allen said. \nThe attack targeted a shopping area about 5 miles from the main border checkpoint with Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. Many of the victims were shot at a Walmart. \n\"The scene was a horrific one,\" Allen said. \nRelatives said a 25-year-old woman who was shot while apparently trying to shield her 2-month-old son was among those killed. Mexican officials said six Mexican nationals were also among the dead. \nMexico planned to take legal action against whoever sold the gun to the suspect, the country's foreign minister said. Gun ownership is highly restricted in Mexico, requiring special permits, and gun shops are rare. \nPresident Donald Trump denounced both shootings, saying \"hate has no place in our country.\" Addressing reporters in Morristown, New Jersey, the president said Sunday that \"we're going to take care\" of the problem. He said he's been speaking to the attorney general, the FBI director and members of Congress and will make an additional statement Monday. \nTrump also pointed to a mental illness problem in the U.S., calling the shooters \"really very seriously mentally ill.\" \nAuthorities were searching for any links between the suspect and the material in the document that was posted online shortly before the shooting, including the writer's expression of concern that an influx of Hispanics into the United States will replace aging white voters. That could potentially turn Texas blue in elections and swing the White House to Democrats. \n\"It's beginning to look more solidly that is the case,\" the police chief said. \nThe writer was also critical of Republicans for what he described as close ties to corporations and degradation of the environment. Though a Twitter account that appears to belong to Crusius included pro-Trump posts praising the plan to build a border wall, the writer of the online document says his views on race predated Trump's campaign and that any attempt to blame the president for his actions was \"fake news.\" \nThe writer denied he was a white supremacist, but the document says \"race mixing\" is destroying the nation and recommends dividing the United States into territorial enclaves determined by race. The first sentence of the four-page document expresses support for the man accused of killing 51 people at two New Zealand mosques in March after posting his own screed with a conspiracy theory about nonwhite migrants replacing whites. \nEl Paso Mayor Dee Margo said he knew the shooter was not from the city. \n\"It's not what we're about,\" the mayor said at the news conference. \n\nLoad-Date: August 6, 2019"
