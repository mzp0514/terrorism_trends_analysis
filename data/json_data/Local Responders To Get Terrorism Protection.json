About 1,700 of the kits will go to Tampa police and Hillsborough County sheriff's deputies.\nEach kit will contain two chemical-resistant suits, a respirator, and gloves and boots to protect patrol officers and deputies, said Chuck Hagan, a project administrator for the state Division of Emergency Management.\nThe equipment offers a lower level of protection than what bomb squad, tactical and hazardous-materials units wear, but it will protect officers around the perimeter of an event so they can offer immediate aid and evacuate people, officials said.\n\"We want to reduce the time between any event and our response to that event,\" said Tampa police Capt. John Bennett, who heads the department's specialty teams. \"The officer needs to have the tools right in their vehicle to hold the fort or until we can replenish them.\"\nAfter the Sept. 11 attacks, Tampa police received air-purifying respirators, which cover the face and allow the officer to breathe through a filter, Bennett said.\nThe Florida Division of Emergency Management is supervising the distribution of the new kits to all of Florida's emergency responders by May 15, Hagan said. The federal grant totals $9.4 million.\nSafeware Inc. of Largo, Md., with an office in Jacksonville, was awarded the contract in January to ship the kits in stages, officials said.\nAbout 5,700 kits are allocated to a nine-county region between Sumter and Manatee counties, said Troy Walker, special agent supervisor for the Clearwater Field Office of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.\nTampa police will receive about 800, Walker said. The Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office will receive about 880.\nEach kit costs $308 and has a shelf life of about five years, Hagan said. He hopes federal money will become available to maintain the gear.\nGray Is For The Real Thing\nThe kits come in black nylon bags with waterproof bottoms. Included are two DuPont protective suits, a blue one for training and a vacuum-sealed gray one to be opened during an actual event, Hagan said.\nThe kits also have a 3M full-face respirator with filters for training and to protect against nerve and biological agents, black PVC boots, chemical-resistant gloves, decontamination agents and chemical-resistant tape to wrap around arms, legs and other potentially exposed areas, Hagan said.\nFire departments have worn protective gear for chemical spills for years, but outfitting police provided a unique challenge, he said.\nField tests guaranteed that the officers could drive cars, direct traffic and fire weapons while wearing the equipment, Hagan said.\n\"We had to swap out the gloves because they were so thick, they couldn't get their fingers through the trigger guards,\" he said.\nTom Latourrette, a scientist at Rand Corp. in Santa Monica, Calif., said Rand spoke to about 200 people from 80 departments in the spring and summer of 2002 about their protection needs. Terrorism protection was a big issue, he said.\nAgencies pushed to get the equipment after the Sept. 11 attacks, but \"we're a long way from understanding how it will be used,\" Latourrette said. \"It stems from a lot of uncertainties: What exactly is going to happen? What are the police going to be doing? … A lot of the protocols for how this is going to be used need to be worked out.\"\nAdd 20 Minutes\nFor instance, donning the gear and taping up takes about 20 minutes, which would need to be factored into response time, Latourrette said. Tool belts are not accessible once underneath the suits, and there is concern about the suits tearing during vigorous activity. The suits are made of a chemical-resistant fabric called Tychem.\n\"It's pretty tough stuff, but it's not designed for structural collapse,\" Latourrette said. Its typical use is within an industrial environment.\n\"Transitioning that into emergency response is difficult, because these suits are cumbersome,\" Latourrette said.\nTampa police Chief Stephen Hogue said: \"It's going to be a delay while we put on the suits, there's no doubt about it. But you can't ask the officers to run in and commit suicide. … Anything's better than nothing, and the state's providing them.\"\nHe thinks training will provide some answers. Fort Walton Beach police, where Hogue was police chief before coming to Tampa, also had received these suits.\n\"Depends on the level of threat, what kind of threat it is, what we know about it,\" Hogue said. \"It's obviously going to be a touchy situation.\"\n\n(CHART) (C) WHAT IT MEANS\nAlthough the new chemical suits are not as protective as the ones worn by tactical and hazardous-materials units, they will protect officers around the perimeter of an event so they can offer immediate aid and evacuate people.\n\n(CHART) (C) CHEMICAL - RESISTANT SUITS\nDuPon's Tychem F Chemical Protection Suite\n3M full-face respirator filters protect against nerve and biological agents.\nChemical-resistant tape wraps around arms, legs and other openings.\nChemical-resistant gloves\nThe suit is made from a special chemical-resistant fabric.\nPVC boots\nTribune graphic by K.
