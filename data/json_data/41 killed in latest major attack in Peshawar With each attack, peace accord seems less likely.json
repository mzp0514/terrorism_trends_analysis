    "full text": "A car bomb tore through a centuries-old market in Peshawar on Sunday, killing at least 41 people in the third major attack on the Pakistani city in a week.\nThe midday explosion at Qissa Khawani Bazaar, or the market of storytellers, damaged dozens of shops and injured more than 100 people. The carnage also included 16 members of an extended family who burned to death in a van, making them the latest symbol of Pakistan's painful struggle to combat terrorism within its borders.\nThe market in Peshawar's old city is not far from All Saints Church, where 85 people were killed a week ago in what is thought to be the worst attack on Christians in Pakistan's history. \nThat attack was followed by a bus bombing on the outskirts of town that killed 18 government workers rushing home for Friday's Muslim prayers.\nThe attacks in Peshawar, a provincial capital, add fuel to the deepening mistrust between residents and government leaders over how best to restore order. \nThe city of 1 million people appears to be bearing the brunt of militant attacks aimed at undermining Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's plans to hold peace talks with the Pakistani Taliban.\nWith each new attack, a negotiated peace appears less likely, as Sharif's critics back away from their earlier support for such talks.\nThis is a shocking development, and the latest wave of terrorism has forced the people to review their thinking, said Aftab Khan Sherpao, a member of the National Assembly and a former chief minister of the province.\nAnother legislator, Farhatullah Babar, said there is a growing sense that peace talks amount to appeasement.\nIt has backfired and emboldened the militants not only to step up their attacks but also mount an assault on the basic structures of the state, he said.\nQissa Khawani Bazaar was once the hub of northwest Pakistan's spice and tea trade. According to local historians, travelers going as far as back 1 or 2 B.C. would stop there to listen to storytellers.\nIn 1930, during the colonial era, the market was the site of a bloody crackdown by British troops known locally as the Qissa Khawani massacre.\n\nLoad-Date: October 1, 2013"
