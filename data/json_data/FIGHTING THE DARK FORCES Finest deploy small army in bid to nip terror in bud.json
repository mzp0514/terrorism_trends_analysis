Another 450 are uniformed cops and detectives participating in a variety of counter-terrorism operations that change according to intelligence and world events.\n\"It's a work in progress, so to speak,\" said Maki Haberfeld, chairwoman of the Department of Law, Police Science and Criminal Justice Administration at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \"New things are happening around the world. You say, 'Are we prepared for this?' \"\nAccording to a report prepared by the Washington-based Police Executive Research Forum, the NYPD has transformed its operating philosophy, organizational structure and daily responsibilities since Sept. 11, 2001.\nOne of the first things Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly did when he took over in January 2002 was to create the NYPD's Counter Terrorism Bureau.\nThe bureau consists of about 250 officers dedicated to counterterrorism activities.\nThe Intelligence Division, beefed up substantially over the past six years, uses about half of its 600 cops on counterterror functions. Before 9/11, the division spent most of its time and resources on protecting dignitaries and developing intelligence on traditional criminals.\nThe 450 officers assigned counterterrorism duties on a daily basis include detectives and regular officers, such as a scuba diver checking the Brooklyn Bridge.\nThe detail includes another 150 cops who \"surge\" twice every day on potential terror-targets, such as Times Square or Herald Square, Browne said.\nThe Counter Terrorism Bureau also analyzes the worldwide terror threat, administers training for cops, researches established and emerging threats and conducts risk assessments on the city's infrastructure, according to the Police Executive Research Forum report, which was based on research from the National Institute of Justice.\nThe report says Kelly receives a terrorism \"briefing package\" compiled with so-called open-source material, such as news media reports, and confidential information developed by the NYPD Intelligence Division.\nKelly then meets with officials from the Counter Terrorism Bureau and the Intelligence Division for an hour to discuss terrorism related issues and deploy cops appropriately, Browne said.\nMitchell Silber, an NYPD senior intelligence analyst, said the department understands the importance of investigating a worldwide threat on a local level.\n\"Our philosophy is, 'Let's understand our communities, know the different shop owners, know the people and their backgrounds,' \" he said.\nSilber said the Intelligence Division develops \"organic investigations\" at the street level to detect attacks while they're still in the planning phase.\nThe PERF report quotes one division official as saying that gathering intelligence involves \"developing the confidence of the public . . . so that they are willing to provide information\" and \"dealing with the right guys on the street,\" in particular, \"developing good confidential informants.\"\nIn 2004, an organic investigation helped foil a terrorist plot to detonate bomb-filled backpacks in an attack on Herald Square, Silber said.\nIn that case, terrorists hoped to bomb the bustling station on Aug. 24, three days before the Republican National Convention, police said.\nThe investigation began when a police informant approached Shahawar Siraj at Islamic Books and Tapes in Bay Ridge. Silber said knowing that Islamic books and tapes were a \"radicalization incubator\" was key in that case.\n\"The threat was one that grew up in Westernized cities,\" he said. \"The only way to stop that plot is knowing the city at a granual level.\"\nThe division also reaches out to business owners through Operation Nexus, which looks for unusual business practices that could have links to terror.\nInvestigators have a particular interest in radioactive materials, Browne said.\n\"One of our ongoing concerns is a dirty bomb,\" Browne said.\nThe NYPD runs \"Operation Rolling Vigilance\" to stop and inspect trucks that could be carrying chemicals or radioactive materials.\nThe operation was stepped up substantially this month when a Web site with ties to Israeli intelligence reported picking up online chatter of a dirty bomb threat.\n\"This whole concept of counterterrorism after 911 is a very mobile concept,\" Haberfeld said. \"The NYPD is the best among all the forces in the United States when it comes to their preparedness.\" tmoore@nydailynews.com\nGRAPHIC: SAFEGUARDING THE CITY\nA thousand NYPD cops work the counterterrorism beat on an approximately $200 million budget.\nHere's a look:\nNYPD Counter Terrorism Bureau\n250 cops\nAnalyzes the worldwide terror threat for purpose of deploying police assets\nAdministers counterterrorism training for NYPD personnel\nResearches established and emerging threats\nConducts risk assessments on critical infrastructure\nDevelops plans for protecting key sites\nNYPD Intelligence Division\n300 cops\nField Intelligence officers are assigned to police precincts as well as borough commands to provide a link between the street cop and the Intelligence Division.\nAgents vet and field calls to the city's terrorism tip hotline, (888) NYC-SAFE.\nOversees \"Operation Nexus,\" a program that reaches out to businesses across the nation to identify suspicious activities that could be linked to terrorism.\nInvestigates emerging threats and examines terrorism response in other cities.
