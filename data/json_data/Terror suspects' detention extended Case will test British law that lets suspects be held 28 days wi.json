    "full text": "LONDON - British investigators were granted another week to question 23 suspects in an alleged plot to blow up trans-Atlantic jetliners, and a Pakistan official said authorities there were seeking a British Muslim, an Eritrean and a Pakistani in connection with the case.\nA suspect arrested on Tuesday was released without charge shortly after the hearing late Wednesday in London, Scotland Yard said. It did not say why or identify the person. Another suspect was released without charge Aug. 11.\nA Pakistani intelligence official said on Wednesday that authorities there were seeking a British Muslim of Afghan origin, an Eritrean national and a Pakistani.\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the inquiry, said the three suspects had been in contact with others who planned to blow up as many as 10 U.S.-bound planes leaving London.\nA district judge ruled late Wednesday that the 23 arrested since Aug. 10 and still detained can be held without charge, as investigators continued to search several homes and businesses for clues, including indications of outside help and al-Qaida involvement.\nThe case is the first major test of a new terrorism law that lets suspects be held for as long as 28 days without charge while investigators try to solidify their cases.\nThe hearing was held behind closed doors and attended only by the suspects' lawyers, investigators and government officials.\nScotland Yard said that 21 of the suspects could be detained for questioning through Aug. 23, and two others could be detained until Aug. 21. No reason was given for the difference in the length of time.\nExperts say the primary reason police could need nearly a month to complete a probe is because of the complexity of investigations into the alleged plot to smuggle liquid explosives hidden in hand luggage aboard flights.\n\"You've got laptops, you have to bring in translators to translate all the documents in there, and sometimes it's inopportune to release all your suspects - particularly terrorism suspects - while all that is being downloaded and translated,\" said Cliff Knuckey, a retired police detective who has worked on terrorism investigations.\nThe extra time lets investigators examine computer hard drives and other data for clues, including whether financing for the alleged plot came from home or abroad.\nPreviously, police were able to detain people suspected of terrorism offenses for 14 days only. But the new legislation, which became law earlier this year, also created new offenses, including preparing a terrorist act, giving or receiving terrorist training, and selling or spreading terrorist publications.\nHome Secretary John Reid, Britain's chief law-and-order official, acknowledged that some of the suspects in the present case would likely not be charged with major criminal offenses, but said there was mounting evidence of a \"substantial nature\" to back the allegations.\nIf investigators find they need more time, they can request an extension next week.\n\nLoad-Date: August 18, 2006"
