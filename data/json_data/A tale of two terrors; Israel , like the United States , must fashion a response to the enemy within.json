    "full text": "The analogizing of Yitzhak Rabin's murder began even before his stark and moving funeral ended. Was this Israel's Kennedy assassination? Israel's Lincoln assassination?\nPerhaps this is Israel's Oklahoma City. Israelis weeping in the streets of Tel Aviv seem stricken by the same compound horror as Americans were when we discovered not only that the heartland was vulnerable (Israelis knew this all too well) but that the attack was from within.\nThe man accused in Oklahoma was Tim McVeigh, Gulf War veteran, Bronze Star winner. Israel's assassin was Yigal Amir, veteran of the Golani Brigade. The right-wing ultras we, and the Israelis, took too lightly for too long mean business, and they enjoy a disturbing measure of sympathy.\nAlmost as stunning as the Oklahoma bombing itself was that some Americans saw McVeigh's act as an extreme but understandable response to federal provocations. Israeli rightists are muttering similar apologies. Amir is ''a righteous man,'' said one West Bank settler.\nLike America's Republican right in the wake of Oklahoma City, Israel's conservative Likud opposition, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, stands accused of ''creating a climate'' that emboldened the crazies.\nNewt Gingrich and Rush Limbaugh never openly endorsed the militias, their violence or the worst ravings of the American gun lobby. But nor were such people cast out of the Republican revolution. Netanyahu refused to label Rabin a murderer, a traitor or a Nazi. But in its own battle to stop the Rabin government's land-for-peace deal, Likud, too, pursued a policy of ''no enemies on the right.''\nAs it happens, Netanyahu capitalized on Oklahoma City by publishing a book in the United States titled ''Fighting Terrorism: How Democracies Can Defeat Domestic and International Terrorism.'' The book voices alarm about Islamic fundamentalists and unreconstructed elements in the PLO. In the knowing tones of a veteran imparting wisdom, Netanyahu advises the United States on how to deal with ''domestic terrorism.'' But there is scant indication that this expert realized domestic right-wing terror might be incubating within Israel, too.\nNetanyahu blamed Rabin's government for creating a climate that encouraged renewed Islamic violence and tied the hands of security forces. ''If hitherto Israel had shown the world how terrorism could be fought, now it showed how terrorism could be facilitated.''\nAt his arraignment, Yigal Amir closely echoed these extraordinary insinuations, charging that Rabin's government ''brought on all the terrorist attacks.''\nNetanyahu, of all people, should have known better. His book is actually quite nuanced and commonsensical, if predictably hard-line, on the question of how a democracy can protect civil liberties while acting against terrorists.\nAny democracy's first line of defense, Netanyahu wrote, is its political culture: ''The salient point that has to be underlined again and again is that nothing justifies terrorism -- that it is evil per se. â€¦ ''\nBut the second line of defense is, and must be, ''operational'': tough law enforcement, including greater latitude to eavesdrop on, and infiltrate, potentially violent groups.\nOn both counts, Netanyahu was right. And on both counts, the United States' own response to Oklahoma City has flagged. What once seemed genuine national introspection about the inflammatory tone and content of public discourse shows signs of fading amid the hyperbole and polarization of the presidential campaign. (See, for example, the press conference at which conservative activists lined up to label Colin Powell a liberal menace to the Republic.)\nCapitol Hill Republicans, appeasing the ultraright, hosted hearings for camouflage-clad militiamen. In alliance with civil libertarians, they stopped President Clinton's relatively mild anti-terrorism package.\nAs the initial unifying grief surrounding the murder of Rabin gradually gives way to Israel's own election campaign, watch Netanyahu and his fellow nationalist conservatives. To his credit, Netanyahu immediately promised to support Peres's accession to the prime ministership; the government, he said, can be changed only by ballots, not by bullets. That strengthens the first line of defense -- political culture -- which the Israeli right had hitherto done its bit to weaken.\nBut the democratic right must also join Peres in defining the threat of domestic terrorism, and in helping ''crush'' the ultras, as Interior Minister Ehud Barak has promised to do. The battle plan for such a crackdown could come from the pages of Netanyahu's own book.\nOne step, ''freezing the financial assets, held in the Western countries, of terrorist regimes and organizations'' has already been taken. But Netanyahu also called for ''outlawing fund-raising and channeling of funds to terrorist groups.'' He advocated ''tightening immigration laws,'' which, applied to Israel, might mean modifying the Law of Return to screen out extremists.\n''The continued existence in the United States of heavily armed anti-government militias numbering thousands of members is a grotesque distortion of the idea of civil freedom,'' Netanyahu wrote, calling for regulation of gun ownership. Shouldn't a similar standard apply to Israeli paramilitary groups?\nNetanyahu argued that any democracy's basic advantage against terrorism is the patriotism and ingrained aversion to political violence of its citizens. Second is the need for forceful government action to isolate any nascent terrorism.\nNetanyahu was referring to the United States, but, sadly, his analysis now applies to Israel.\n\nNotes\n\nCharles Lane is a senior editor of The New Republic, in which this article first appeared.\n\nLoad-Date: November 14, 1995"
