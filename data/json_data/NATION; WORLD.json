One of the attackers was also killed, the army said.\nDespite the violence, the two sides pushed forward with coordination of Israel's planned withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in mid-August. They were prodded by U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who wrapped up a two-day visit to the region yesterday by saying she was reassured that Israel and the Palestinians are committed to a peaceful pullout.Rice's visit, ahead of an Israeli-Palestinian summit tomorrow, appeared to add momentum to cooperation on the Israeli withdrawal.\nAir Canada cancels\n32-plane Boeing order\nAir Canada canceled an order for 32 widebody Boeing Co. jets after pilots rejected a contract deal that would have freed up funds for the new airplanes.\nPilots voted Saturday to reject terms that were tied to the aircraft order, which Air Canada announced April 25. The deal was worth about $6 billion at list prices, although airlines typically negotiate discounts, and was subject to employees accepting certain cost-cutting measures.\nMontreal-based Air Canada emerged from bankruptcy protection last year.\nPair's remake of 'Jackass'\ngets no stars from Pa. cops\nA man and a teenager face charges for allegedly staging a fake kidnapping that recreated a scene from \"Jackass: The Movie.\"\nOn Wednesday a store clerk called police and said that while a customer was paying for gasoline a teenager jumped out of the trunk with his hands bound and his eyes blindfolded, according to Dauphin County authorities.\nThe man caught the teen, threw him back into the trunk and drove off, police said.\nBut, when officers in Lykens, Pa., found the pair, they said they were re-enacting a prank from the 2002 gag and gross-out film, police said.\nDaniel Reedinger, 31, was charged with creating a false alarm, corruption of minors and disorderly conduct. The 15-year-old will be handled by juvenile authorities. *\n\nLoad-Date: September 14, 2005"
