LOUIS - A Bosnian immigrant who used to live in Illinois pleaded guilty Monday to a federal conspiracy charge for her role in an effort to support terrorist groups in Iraq and Syria.\nJasminka Ramic entered the plea to one count of conspiring to provide material support to terrorists in U.S. District Court in St. Louis. Her sentencing is set for Jan. 5.\nRamic was among six Bosnian immigrants indicted in February and accused of funneling money and military supplies to the Islamic State group and al-Qaida in Iraq. She was accused of contributing $700 to the effort.\nRamic, who became a U.S. citizen in 2006, formerly lived in Rockford, Illinois, but moved to Germany, where she was arrested.\nHer attorney, J. Christian Goeke, did not immediately return messages seeking comment.\nThe other five suspects have pleaded not guilty. Three of them, husband and wife Ramiz and Sedina Hodzic, and Armin Harcevic, live in St. Louis County. Also accused are Mediha Medy Salkicevic of Schiller Park, Illinois, and Nihad Rosic of Utica, New York.\nFederal authorities say Ramiz Hodzic used Facebook, PayPal, Western Union and the U.S. Postal Service to coordinate shipments of money and supplies through an overseas intermediary.\nHe and his wife are accused of making 10 wire transfers totaling $8,850, and arranging two shipments of military supplies valued at $2,451.\n- THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nLoad-Date: September 29, 2015"
