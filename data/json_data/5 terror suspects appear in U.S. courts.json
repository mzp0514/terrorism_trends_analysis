The preacher was one of five terror defendants rounded up in Britain and extradited overnight to the U.S. Abu Hamza al-Masri was surrounded by several marshals in a Manhattan courtroom as he faced charges he conspired with Seattle men to set up a terrorist training camp in Oregon and helped abduct 16 hostages, two of them American tourists, in Yemen in 1998. In the 1990s, al-Masri turned London's Finsbury Park Mosque into a training ground for extremist Islamists, attracting men including Sept. 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui. Al-Masri - jailed since 2004 in Britain on separate charges - was flown overnight to New York from London along with four others accused of U.S. embassy bombings in Africa and with helping terror operations in Afghanistan and Chechnya. The men, who could all face life in prison, have been battling extradition for eight to 14 years. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara called the extraditions \"a watershed moment in our nation's efforts to eradicate terrorism.\"\n\nLoad-Date: October 7, 2012"
