    "full text": "To the Editor:\nRe ''Power to Strip Citizenship Is Expanded in Britain'' (news article, May 15):\nBritain's new legislation granting its government the power to strip even native Britons of their citizenship, and of the rights that come with that status -- if they are even suspected of involvement in terrorism -- is a terrifying step toward tyranny by one of the premier Western democracies.\nThis measure tosses the presumption of innocence down what one of that country's best-known writers, George Orwell, dubbed the memory hole. In effect, under this law, mere suspicion is tantamount to conviction without trial if the charge is terrorism-related.\nIt's also disturbing that the new law was rammed through apparently in response to a single case out of 15 appeals of citizenship removal under the earlier British denaturalization law, the only such case to be won by the plaintiff.\nIt looks altogether too much as if it were specifically written in revenge against that plaintiff for daring to succeed in keeping his citizenship when the government had decided to take it away, and for the purpose of guaranteeing that no one else will.\nThat's petulance wedded to power, which is a dangerous marriage.\nERIC B.
