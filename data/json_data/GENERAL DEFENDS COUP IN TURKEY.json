Kenan Evren said the five generals in the junta were ''obliged to carry out this operation in order to save the armed forces from being infected by politics.''\nTurkey's General Kenan Evren defends September 1980 military coup in speech to Turkish War College in Ankara\n''If we hadn't done it, we believe that the army would be involved in politics,'' the general said. ''We are running the administration only with a team of five generals, according to the military hierarchy. We are doing our best not to infect the lower ranks. And we are determined that as soon as the country is based on real democratic principles, we will return to our jobs.''\n \nUrges Students to Avoid Politics\n''My sons, I advise you never to get involved in politics,'' General Evren said at a ceremony opening the academic year at the college. ''If the army enters into politics, discipline disappears slowly and the army disintegrates and sinks slowly.''\nAt a press conference following the takeover, General Evren had accused extremists of trying to divide the armed forces.  The general later presided at a meeting at which the junta debated and approved plans proposed by Prime Minister Bulent Ulusu.  ''The problems that our country is facing and the recent world developments around us make your task more important and your responsibility heavier,'' General Ersin said at the meeting. He said priority should be given to eliminating terrorism and improving the economy."
