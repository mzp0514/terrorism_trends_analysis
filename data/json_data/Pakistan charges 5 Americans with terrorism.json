They were reported missing by their families in November after one left behind a farewell video showing scenes of war and casualties and saying Muslims must be defended.\nTheir lawyer has said they were heading to Afghanistan and had no plans to stage attacks inside Pakistan.\nThe court also charged the men with planning attacks on Afghan and U.S. territory, said Dastagir. The charges did not specify what was meant by U.S. territory but could be a reference to American bases or diplomatic outposts in Afghanistan.\nThe men also were charged with contributing cash to banned organizations to be used for terrorism and with directing each other to commit terrorist acts.\n\"This last charge carries life in prison while the rest of the charges have lesser punishments,\" Dastagir said.\nThe trial will begin March 31, and the prosecution is slated to present more than 20 witnesses, Dastagir said.\nThe defense plans to bring witnesses from the U.S. and provide evidence of community service carried out by the men back home, Dastagir said.\nPakistani police have publicly made several accusations against the young men, claiming the suspects contacted Pakistani-based jihadist groups. They accused the five of using the social networking site Facebook and video-sharing site YouTube while they were in the U.S. to try to connect with extremist groups in Pakistan.\nDuring past court hearings, the men have claimed they were tortured by Pakistani police and FBI agents. Pakistan and the U.S. have denied those allegations.\nNihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said in a phone interview Wednesday from Washington that the parents of the five have received letters from their children detailing the alleged torture, including beatings and threats of electrocution. --\nCase details\nTorture » Authorities in the United States and Pakistan have denied accusations of torture, and skeptics have said that would-be terrorists are trained to allege torture if caught as a form of propaganda.\nMilitants » The U.S. has pressed an often-reluctant Pakistan to crack down on militants in its territory, many of whom are believed involved in attacks on American and NATO forces across the border in Afghanistan.\nLetter » In one letter to family members, dated March 10, one of the five writes, \"They beat the hell out of me and the rest of us until we said what they wanted us to say. Wallahi [by God)] they even threatened to electrocute us the day before court so we don't tell the judge, but we spoke out.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \nThe Associated Press Pakistani defense lawyer of five arrested young Americans, Shahid Kamal, left, talks Wednesday to media with Pakistani human rights activist Khalid Khawaja outside a jail in Sargodha, Pakistan.
