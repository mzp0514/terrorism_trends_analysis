But some savvy risk managers who deem the coverage too expensive are finding other ways to address the risks their companies face.\nAs we report on page 10, few risk managers attending the 41st Risk & Insurance Management Society Inc. Annual Conference & Exhibition recently in Chicago said they're buying terrorism insurance, because they feel the additional premium is just too high for the perceived risk. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 was a welcome piece of legislation aimed at keeping coverage available, but TRIA has not kept insurers from charging exorbitant rates. Not surprisingly, most companies are unwilling to pay those prices.\nWe fervently hope there will never again be losses on the scale of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but the fact remains that terrorism losses are rare. Other perils need attention, too. Some risk managers attending the RIMS conference report that they are working to address terrorism risks by making their facilities more secure and helping employees feel safer.\nWe applaud risk managers who are taking steps to help people cope with terrorism fears. Anxiety caused by fear of terrorist attacks-or indeed any kind of risk-can cause a string of workplace problems. For example, employee anxiety may lead to reduced productivity, absenteeism and even injury.\nBesides making the workplace environment safer, protecting against terrorist attacks carries another important benefit: organizations that demonstrate good risk management are in the best position to negotiate more-favorable rates.\nAn environmentalist slogan advises people to ''think globally and act locally.'' That's a good approach for risk managers in these times of uncertainty.\n\nLoad-Date: April 25, 2003"
