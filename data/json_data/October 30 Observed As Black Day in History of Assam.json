    "full text": "Black Day observed every year in memory of those who died in the serial blasts on October 30, 2008. It was on the fateful day of October 30, 2008, that blasts rocked Guwahati, Barpeta Road, Bongaigaon and Kokrajhar leaving a trail of death and destruction.\n\nEven today when remembered still shakes the body of the people as 72 lives have been lost alone in Guwahati.\n\nPeople pay tribute to the people who lost their lives at CJM court in Panbazaar and below the Ganeshguri flyover.\n\nAfter 11 years, successive governments have not been able to give adequate compensation to the families of the victims. The perpetrators of the ghastly crime are roaming scot-free. Like every year, a function was held near the Ganeshguri flyover in Guwahati to pay homage to the people who lost their lives. But, the million-dollar question remains when will these merchants of death be taken to the gallows?\n\nA day when we should stand beside those families who lost their dear ones in the bomb blasts. For once we should leave our religious sentiments aside and pay heed to humanity.\n\nAll over the state, the day is also dedicated to fighting against terror with the All Assam Student's Union (AASU) lighting diyas in their offices and major public places all over the state.\n\nSonowal has appealed to the people of Assam to light three candles for the soldiers fighting terrorism along the country's border.\n\nLoad-Date: October 30, 2019"
