Though neither charge has been proved, Mr. Karry was not re-elected to a regional post because of the dispute.\nMr. Nittel, 50, was the minister responsible for transport issues in the Vienna regional government. His support for the construction of urban expressways was also opposed by environmentalists.\nBoth Mr. Karry and Mr. Nittel had Jewish backgrounds. Mr. Karry's father, a Jew, survived detention in concentration camps under the Nazis, and the son was honorary chairman of a Jewish aid organization in Frankfurt. Mr. Nittel was chairman of the Austrian-Israeli Society.\n \n----\n \nCaller Claims Responsibility\nBONN, Tuesday, May 12 (Reuters) -An anonymous telephone caller who said he represented ''The Movement of the Third Reich'' claimed responsibility for the killing of Heinz Karry. A spokesman for the prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe said the group, presumed to be rightist, was not known to police. The call was made to a Frankfurt newspaper office.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nIllustrations: Photo of Heinz Karry"
