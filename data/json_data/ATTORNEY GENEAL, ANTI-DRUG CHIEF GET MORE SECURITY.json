Bennett, but officials declined Tuesday to directly link the measures to Colombia's crackdown on drug traffickers.  ''It was a combination of threats in the area of terrorism, both from domestic concerns and from international areas.\nAlso, narco-terrorism was a part of it,'' an FBI spokesman, Milt Ahlerich, said about the increase in security for Thornburgh.  The attorney general has been using an armor-plated limousine for three or four weeks, said a Justice Department, spokesman David Runkel. The limo cost more than $100,000. Thornburgh also has been using a basement entrance at the department instead of the street-level door he had been using, Runkel said.  Both Ahlerich and Runkel declined to say whether Colombia's war on drugs was a specific factor. Colombia began a crackdown on drug traffickers in mid-August.  ''Th ere has been since mid-August a heightened concern for security,'' Runkel said. He refused to say whether there had been any specific threats against Thornburgh.  The U.S. Marshals Service has assigned a permanent security detail to protect Bennett, the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, said Bill Dempsey, a spokesman for the Marshals Service.  The security was ''not solely because of the Colombian situation, but partly'' the result of it, Dempsey said.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPhoto; Photo Headshot - Dick Thornburgh, Attorney General Photo Headshot - William J.
