    "full text": "AN EMPLOYEE TAPPED to investigate the Port Authority's vulnerability to terrorism testified yesterday that his bosses rejected his recommendations to shut the public parking garage under the World Trade Center.\nAfter Edward O'Sullivan, 66, a mechanical engineer, turned over his report to newly installed PA Executive Director Stephen Berger in late 1985, Berger hired a private consulting agency to conduct a second study, O'Sullivan said.\nThe testimony came at the Manhattan Supreme Court trial in which hundreds of plaintiffs are suing the agency for failing to close the underground garage to the public.\nSix people died and more than a thousand were injured when a bomb-laden van exploded beneath the Trade Center on Feb. 26, 1993, years before the 9/11 attacks.\nO'Sullivan was appointed to investigate the PA's terrorism risk by a previous executive director Peter Goldmark.\nA lawyer for the plaintiffs, David Dean, quizzed O'Sullivan about Berger's reaction to the study. \"I think what Mr. Berger was surprised at was the breadth of the study and the recommendations therein,\" said O'Sullivan, who no longer works for the PA.\nBerger hired Science Applications International Corp., a private consulting firm, to take a second look at the issue.\nO'Sullivan said in a pretrial deposition that SAIC consultant Harvey McGeorge agreed that the garage should be closed to the public, though that suggestion did not appear in his report. hpeterson@nydailynews.com\n\nLoad-Date: October 7, 2005"
