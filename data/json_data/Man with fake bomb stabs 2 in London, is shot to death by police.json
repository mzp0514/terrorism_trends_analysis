    "full text": "LONDON â€” A man recently released from prison after serving time for terrorism-related offenses strapped on a fake bomb and stabbed two people on a busy London street Sunday before being shot to death by police, officials said. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Lucy D'Orsi said police identified the attacker as 20-year-old Sudesh Amman. He had been convicted of publishing graphic terrorist videos online and had stockpiled instructions on bomb making and knife attacks, according to police. \nOfficers had been trailing Amman at the time of Sunday's attack, D'Orsi said, but were unable to head off the bloodshed in the commercial and residential south London neighborhood of Streatham, where Amman struck outside a major pharmacy on a busy shopping afternoon. The incident in London recalled a November stabbing attack carried out by another man who had served prison time for terrorism offense. Two were killed in that attack. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said measures will be introduced Monday to bring \"fundamental\" change to the way people convicted of terrorism offenses are handled in prison and afterward. \"The suspect had been recently released from prison where he had been serving a sentence for Islamist-related terrorism offenses,\" D'Orsi said of Sunday's attacker. It seems likely the victims will survive Sunday's attack. D'Orsi said a stabbing victim in his 40s thought to be in life-threatening condition has improved. She said the victim is no longer in danger and that a woman who had been hospitalized has been released. One other female victim is still in the hospital with lesser injuries police believe were caused by flying glass after the attacker was shot dead. Officials praised police, but questions are likely to be raised about why the officers trailing Amman could not prevent his attack.\n\nNotes\n\nEds: UPDATES: with suspect having been convicted up publishing graphic terrorist videos online.
