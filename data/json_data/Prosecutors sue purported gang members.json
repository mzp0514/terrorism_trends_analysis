    "full text": "Calling it a \"strong tool\" to combat gangs, McHenry County State's Attorney Louis Bianchi announced Tuesday that his office and the city of Harvard have sued five men they say are Latin Kings members in an effort to stop them from gathering and owning guns and otherwise engaging in criminal activity.\n\"This initiative seeks to destroy the infrastructure of the gang and promote zero tolerance of gang-related activity,\" Bianchi said in a prepared statement. He was not available for further comment.\nThe suit, filed under the 1993 Illinois Street Gang Terrorism Omnibus Prevention Act, seeks to classify the Latin Kings as members of a street gang and prohibit them from meeting or associating with each other.\nIt's a tactic that's been used before, in a joint suit between Kane County and Elgin.\nFive Harvard residents — Antonio M. Figueroa, 29; Alfredo Garcia-Castillo, 21; Justin Pena, 27; Genaro Pena, 29; and Spencer M.L. Ortiz, 21 — were named as defendants, along with \"other unnamed Latin King members.\"\nDonna Kelly, chief of the McHenry County state's attorney's office's civil division, said everyone except Genaro Pena had been served with the lawsuit.\n\"The whole purpose of the lawsuit is to curtail gang recruitment and to keep the community safe,\" Kelly said. \"We're hoping this does have a deterrent effect. Is it going to cease gang activity altogether? No.\"\nKelly said other defendants could be added to the lawsuit if they commit two gang-related criminal offenses — including a forcible felony — within a five-year span.\n\nLoad-Date: February 15, 2012"
