However, passengers should be aware that marijuana laws vary state by state and they are encouraged to check the laws of the states in which they plan to travel.\"\n Federally, marijuana is illegal. The Los Angeles Times reported that once passengers get to a Transportation Security Administration area, federal regulations are in place. TSA is an agency run by the U.S. government.\n It is up to local law enforcement officers to decide if the passenger can travel with marijuana if it is discovered during a luggage check.\n \"TSA's focus is on terrorism and security threats to the aircraft and its passengers,\" TSA spokeswoman Lorie Dankers told The Associated Press Thursday. \"Whether or not the passenger is allowed to travel with marijuana is up to law enforcement's discretion.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \nTravelers are allowed to carry marijuana at LAX, but if it is found by Transportation Security Administration agents, local law enforcement will be involved. Marijuana is illegal federally, but legal in California. (Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images) (Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images/Getty Images)\n\nLoad-Date: November 15, 2018"
