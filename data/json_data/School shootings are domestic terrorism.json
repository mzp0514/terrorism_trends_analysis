    "full text": "School shootings are domestic terrorist attacks that demand action. Easy possession of assault rifles is definitely a causation. In that vein, it is time to take action to make schools safe, educational places. School shootings would be seen as inevitable if we do not reform firearm policies. We need to ban assault rifles while terminating ties between suppliers and distributors.\nNew requirements that would take place nationwide would include deep background checks and validated permits.\nThe shooting that happened in Parkland, Florida, was cataclysmic and devastating for those who have lost their loved ones. It should not take another shooting to open the eyes of political leaders, especially the head of state, to update security. With the enforcement of metal detectors, security guards whose credentials keep innocent civilians safer, visuals on entrances, and a profuse number of active police officers on patrol around neighborhoods, school shootings may be less likely.\nUpdated security and better gun regulations are not the only solutions to this quandary. Talk of mental illness is seen as a stigma, which leaves those with mental illnesses ignored. School boards should hold assemblies, for students, parents and teachers on what mental illness is and affirm that assistance is provided to those who seek it. This will signify to children with mental illnesses that they are not social outcasts and that they truly have potential.\nIvan Derenoncourt, Grade 10\nJ.P.
