The operation was aimed to end Chechnya&apos;s post-Soviet independence movement.\nAlthough the active phase of the anti-terrorism campaign officially ended in 2001, periodic bombings and clashes between militants and federal troops still disrupt Chechnya and nearby regions, particularly Daghestan and Ingushetia.\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\nCopyright(c) 2009 RTTNews.com, Inc.
