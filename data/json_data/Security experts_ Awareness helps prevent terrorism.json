Because of this, Boynton said that if administrators prepared for events like these, they could minimize damages.\nRichard Maurer, managing director of the Security Services Group for Kroll, Inc., said that the company is currently a worldwide leader in providing threat assessment and risk management services to many universities, corporations and agencies.\nMaurer said the level of risk is the first thing his company looks for when preparing a security assessment for an organization.\n\"Universities tend to be very good targets,\" he said. \"Just the nature of campuses make them wide open.\"\nKroll, Inc. typically analyzes three categories for colleges, including terrorism, environmental and location risks.\nA few risks Maurer identified included elements such as ROTC programs, government funded research facilities and locations by railroad tracks.\nMaurer stressed that not every risk could be identified, but every effort must be made to realize the major ones.\n\"The World Trade Center was probably one of the most secure buildings in the world,\" he said, \"but it wasn't ready for an airplane slamming into the side of it.\"\nMaurer said that every establishment, including universities, needs to have an emergency procedure and warning plan that will be effective for the organization it will be applied to.\n\"Always plan for Murphy's Law,\" he said. \"If it can go wrong, it will go wrong.\"\nDr. Bill Waugh of the Georgia State Public Administration and Urban Studies said an emergency plan for a university is a difficult matter because of the different number of people involved in the decision.\nWaugh said at a large university, officials would have to deal with reluctant professors, researchers and perhaps even students, who may refuse to evacuate in an extreme situation.\n\"Experience shows that if you issue a warning, compliance won't always be the case,\" he said. \"If you give enough information to people so they know what's going on, they will be less likely to panic.\"\nWaugh said anyone interested in terrorism on college campuses should visit the Federal Emergency Management Web site at http:// www.fema.gov for more information.\n(C) 2002 The Battalion via U-WIRE\n\nLoad-Date: March 5, 2003"
