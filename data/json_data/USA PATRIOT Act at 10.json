    "full text": "What are you reading?\nThat seemingly innocuous question becomes frightening if it is posed by the FBI, CIA or other law enforcement agencies.\nThe USA PATRIOT Act turns 10 years old this week.\nWhen it was passed in the weeks following 9/11, we would bet that not many of the members of Congress could even unpack the tortured acronym for \"Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism,\" much less outline the many ways this act strips Americans of their rights.\nBorrowed library books and rented videos are exposed by the USA PATRIOT Act. Email, telephone conversations, medical files, financial data and student records are all open to the FBI and CIA without notification.\nSome say, \"If you're not doing anything illegal, what do you have to fear?\" But reading a book, magazine, or viewing a film does not imply that the reader or viewer advocates, or even agrees with, its point of view.\nIn the past ten years, the Act has increasingly been used against other suspected criminals, increasing the ripples of surveillance that may make anyone subject to \"sneak and peek\" searches and the other excesses of the USA PATRIOT Act.\nWe don't feel any safer.\n\nLoad-Date: November 23, 2012"
