The two sides have \"got to make big progress this week\", he said.\nThe UK later called for the European Union to show more \"realism\" in the negotiations.\nIf Prime Minister Boris Johnson \"respects them, there will be a deal\". The discussions will be based on our largely common draft treaty texts. \"We are working hard to find solutions which fully respect United Kingdom sovereignty, but it is far from certain that an agreement will prove possible and time is now very short\".\nPM Modi Says Nations Supporting Terrorism Should Be Brought to Book\nThe Prime Minister also addressed the issue of cooperation among the BRICS countries on the production of vaccine for COVID-19. The Prime Minister also highlighted reform initiatives undertaken by his government under the \"self-reliant India\" campaign.\nI and our British team have been in talks nearly every day since 22 October.\n'But, although there has been some progress in recent days, there is much work to be done and time is now very short.\nThere has so far been little movement on the most contentious areas - so-called \"level playing field\" fair competition rules and fisheries.\nA failure to strike a deal will hurt both sides, with businesses facing tariffs and other barriers to trade starting on January 1.\nA senior European Union diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the two sides were \"still a bit too far away to be able to feel comfortable\", repeating that Britain needed to make a choice because \"the timetable is very tight\".\nIn London, meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was self-isolating in a flat in his Downing Street residence after he had contact with a British lawmaker who later tested positive for COVID-19.\nFor the United Kingdom, the EU must rescind its hopes of keeping permanent wide access to British waters for European fishermen.\nThe European Parliament has previously said it could give the necessary consent at its last plenary meeting scheduled for this year on December 15-16 - if the lawmakers received a finished text of a trade treaty on Monday at the latest.\nBut he said there did need to be \"headlines\" of a trade agreement this week.\nNevertheless, both the United Kingdom and the bloc \"recognize that time is very short\", Eustice told Sky News' Ridge on Sunday program.\n\nLoad-Date: November 19, 2020"
