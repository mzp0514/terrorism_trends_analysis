    "full text": "Clarence Page strikes the right note in his Oct. 2 column. Look carefully at the laws we pass to combat terrorism so that we do not run roughshod over our own civil liberties.\nWe should take notice when civil libertarians both of the left and of the right oppose sections of the proposals put to Congress to deal with suspected terrorists or criminals.\nAttorney General Ashcroft opposed many of the same laws as a senator, when the Clinton administration tried to put them through, that the Justice Department is now asking for.\nUnder the new laws, wiretaps of all electronic mediums may be set up without prior judicial approval, now required.\nNot only the suspects, but also all of their friends, relatives, teachers or just people they have talked to would also be subject to the same unsupervised surveillance. That means any and all of us.\nAn insidious and often abused present law allows law enforcement to confiscate any property used in a suspected - not even proven - drug transaction, with no court oversight whatsoever. Any means any.\nSome years ago The Pantagraph ran a sobering article on this topic.\nParents and grandparents of suspected dealers of drugs lost homes and automobiles with no legal redress.\nChartered airplanes from unsuspecting businesses were summarily confiscated.\nAgain a few years ago, the Washington Post ran an article reporting that police officers stopped young black men in the street, shaking them down for whatever cash they had in their pockets as \"drug-related money.\"\nThe definition of a crime can be made by any law enforcement officer's say-so to the benefit of that individual or his or her enforcement agency.\nThe new proposals would extend this law to suspected terrorist operations, definition flexible.\nThis is a law made for abuse.\nStanley Gutzman\nNormal\n\nLoad-Date: October 10, 2001"
