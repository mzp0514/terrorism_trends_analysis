    "full text": "Lawmakers have approved $10 billion for the Pentagon as a down payment for the war on terrorism this year, but the full cost easily could climb to more than twice that amount.\nThe $10 billion, originally requested a year ago by the Bush administration, was approved Feb. 12 by the House Appropriations Committee.\nThe Bush administration wants to spend $379.9 billion on defense in fiscal 2004, or about $42 million an hour, as Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld pointed out. At that rate, the Pentagon would be spending about $700,000 per minute, $12,000 per second or $3,000 in the blink of an eye.\nBut not a penny of the $379.9 billion would go to the war on terrorism or the military buildup against Iraq. The Bush administration last year tried to get $10 billion inserted into the annual budget to help cover costs of fighting terrorism. Congress blocked it, saying plans for the money were too vague and there wouldn't be enough control on how the funds were spent.\nRumsfeld, testifying Feb. 13 before the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the military is spending $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion per month on unbudgeted costs for the global war on terrorism. In addition, the buildup for possible war in Iraq - which Rumsfeld characterized as being in support of diplomacy in the region - already has cost taxpayers well over $2 billion.\nIf costs to combat terrorism continue at the current pace, the Defense Department will spend $18 billion on that mission this year. The $2 billion for the Persian Gulf deployment pushes the total over $20 billion. The White House Office of Management and Budget estimates costs for a full-blown war with Iraq easily would exceed $50 billion.\nIn a consolidated spending bill approved Feb. 12, the House Appropriations Committee approved the $10 billion requested by the White House.\nOf the $10 billion approved by the House committee as part of a consolidated spending bill, $3.9 billion is \"for classified programs in support of the global war on terrorism and other critical anti-terrorism initiatives,\" according to public budget documents.\nAn additional $1.62 billion goes to active-duty pay and allowances incurred from October through December 2002, the first quarter of the fiscal year. This includes increased costs for hostile-fire pay, family-separation allowances, hardship-duty pay, food costs and additional personnel kept on the rolls because of stop-loss policies, which involuntarily extend people on active duty.\nThe personnel expenses also include the cost of mobilizing Guard and reserve members for October through December. Mobilizations ranged between 50,000 and 60,000 troops during those months but increased dramatically to more than 150,000 by mid-February.\nBy service, the extra personnel costs totaled $771.2 million for the Army; $563.4 million for the Air Force; $213.8 million for the Navy and $68.6 million for the Marine Corps.\nAnother $4.39 billion of the $10 billion goes to fund operations and maintenance incurred from October through December. This includes transport costs for personnel and equipment, as well as \"operating tempo costs\" and personnel-support costs, including temporary-duty pay, clothing, personal equipment and supplies, subsistence, and medical support and services.\nBy service, the operations and maintenance costs for the first three months of the fiscal year were $1.69 billion for the Air Force; $1.21 billion for the Army; $378.3 million for the Navy; and $202.1 million for the Marine Corps. Also, the Pentagon spent $911.2 million on Defense Department-level costs in those areas.\nThe supplemental spending approved by lawmakers also includes $95.1 million for the Defense Health Program. This covers the costs of \"replacement personnel to perform essential duties of deployed personnel,\" according to lawmakers.\n\nNotes\n\n1 PHOTO\n\nLoad-Date: June 18, 2004"
