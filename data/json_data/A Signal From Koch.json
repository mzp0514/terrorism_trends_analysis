    "full text": "To the Editor:\nRe ''For Congress in New York's Ninth District'' (editorial, Aug. 31):\nIn your endorsement of Assemblyman David Weprin, a Democrat, in the Ninth Congressional District election, you assail me for endorsing the Republican, Bob Turner. My support for Mr. Turner is intended to send a message to President Obama that he cannot throw Israel under the bus with impunity.\nThe president's demand that Israel negotiate with the Palestinian Authority -- which is now governed by Hamas and Fatah -- starting with the pre-1967 lines plus ''swaps'' effectively placed the onus for the lack of progress in negotiations on Israel.\nPresident Obama should have demanded simultaneously that Hamas renounce terrorism before negotiations begin, and that Hamas amend its charter, which calls for the creation of an Islamic state in ''Palestine'' and the obliteration of Israel. Hamas must accept the legitimacy of the state of Israel, and pledge in any peace settlement that it will accept Israel as a Jewish state.\nFinally, Israel must have defensible borders, and the homes of the 500,000 Jews beyond those lines in East Jerusalem and in the West Bank must remain part of Israel.\nEDWARD I. KOCH New York, Aug. 31, 2011\nThe writer is a former mayor of New York.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: September 8, 2011"
