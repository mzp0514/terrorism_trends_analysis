    "full text": "Divided opinions about Lady Gaga are certainly nothing new, but the performer's production company contends that what happened to her scheduled concert in Indonesia crossed the line between criticism and terrorism. In a lawsuit filed March 1 in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Atom Factory Inc. - Lady Gaga's management company - and two concert promoters accused three Lloyd's of London syndicates of improperly denying their claim for losses from the cancellation of her June 2012 concert in Jakarta, Indonesia, due to threats by a local Islamic group.\nAccording to court documents, authorities in Jakarta refused to let Lady Gaga perform after the Islamic Defenders Front publicly threatened \"chaos\" if the concert were permitted in the predominantly Muslim country.\nThe lawsuit names Beazley P.L.C.'s syndicates 623 and 2623 and Talbot Underwriting Ltd.'s syndicate 1183 as defendants.\nLGTours L.L.C. and Mermaid Touring Inc. are co-plaintiffs.\nLady Gaga's managers and the touring companies are seeking at least $75,000 for losses they argue are covered under the terrorism risk policies they purchased through the Lloyd's syndicates.\nContributing: Matt Dunning, Judy Greenwald, Bill Kenealy, and Mike Tsikoudakis\n\nLoad-Date: March 28, 2013"
