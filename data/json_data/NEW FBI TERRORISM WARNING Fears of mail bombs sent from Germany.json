    "full text": "WASHINGTON - Postal inspectors and airlines stepped up security yesterday after the FBI warned that mail bombs from Frankfurt may be included in the flood of holiday packages.\nFederal officials also reported yesterday that a Canadian woman caught bringing an Algerian national across the Vermont border this week has links to an Islamic terrorist organization.\nIn an unusual and cryptic statement put out at 2 a.m., the FBI said it received \"unsubstantiated information that individuals may be planning to send bombs in small parcels\" from Frankfurt, Europe's biggest air hub.\n\"The public should be cautious with parcels originating from or bearing Frankfurt postal markings or stamps\" and should call local police about \"questionable packages,\" the FBI said.\nMail handlers immediately began using X-ray machines to screen incoming parcels and first-class mail from Frankfurt, said Postal Inspection Service spokesman Dan Mihalko. Frankfurt airport increased security, and the Federal Aviation Administration sent an advisory yesterday to U.S. airlines, officials said.\nIn addition, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson yesterday said, \"We are taking extra security precautions at energy installations.\"\nThe precautions were the latest in a series of escalating steps taken by U.S. law enforcement and the military to protect Americans against attack following a series of bomb scares.\nFederal authorities have beefed up security at airports and border crossings since the capture last week of Algerian national Ahmed Ressam, 32, in Washington State and the arrest of a second Algerian, identified as Boubide Chamchi.\nChamchi was stopped in Vermont crossing from Canada with a Canadian woman, Lucia Garofalo.\nIn court documents released yesterday, federal prosecutors in Vermont said they had linked Garofalo's cell phone and the car she was driving to a member of the Algerian Islamic League, Brahim Mahdi, which the documents said were connected to \"organizations sponsoring a number of terrorist acts in Europe and Algeria.\"\nBut in an interview with The Associated Press at his Montreal apartment, Mahdi said he has no connection to terrorism and has never heard of the Algerian Islamic League.\n\"I don't know anything,\" Mahdi said. \"I don't know why they would accuse me of that.\"\nCanadian and U.S. authorities also are investigating whether Ressam, who has been indicted on explosives smuggling charges, had ties to the organization, which allegedly ran a theft ring in Montreal to funnel money into anti-U.S. activities.\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police yesterday raided a Montreal apartment where Ressam was believed to have once lived, but no explosives were found.\n\nLoad-Date: December 24, 1999"
