    "full text": "Government officials say they're moving to boost airline security as recommended by a panel on the 1988 downing of Pan Am Flight 103, but they won't cancel a program to install bomb-detecting devices at airports around the world.\nThe report released May 15 sharply criticized the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and others charged with protecting US air travelers.\nIt called on the government to consider ''preemptive or retaliatory military strikes'' against terrorist enclaves in other countries to combat air terrorism.\n''It's time to punish anyone we can prove took our aircraft down,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D) of New Jersey, a member of the President's Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism.\nThe report criticized the FAA, the State Department, and Pan American World Airways, and recommended major reforms. It marked a victory for families of the victims, who sought formation of the commission against what they called government indifference.\nThe panel called for a system to notify passengers of credible terrorist threats and said the government should take more seriously the possibility of terrorism in the United States.\nThe commission said the Lockerbie disaster, in which 270 people died, ''may well have been preventable.''\nThe report recommended ''a more vigorous US policy that not only pursues and punishes terrorists but also makes state sponsors of terrorism pay a price for their actions.''\nThe report called for ''planning and training for preemptive or retaliatory military strikes against known terrorist enclaves in nations that harbor them.''\nWhite House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater would reacted with caution, saying only ''we certainly agree that we have to be as aggressive as necessary to fight terrorism.''"
