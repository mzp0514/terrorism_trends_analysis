They may also be difficult to detect, and it may be difficult to distinguish natural and accidental occurrences from the terrorist-initiated. The problem is further complicated by the vast diversity of agricultural targets, which include animals, plants, food processing and distribution systems, he said.\n\"As a result, agro-terrorism planning and response create a more complex command and control, as well as complex incident command environment, than usually encountered during natural disaster events,\" McLendon said.\nThe conference, held the week after Gov. Roy Barnes signed a state agricultural security law, was the first event sponsored by UGA's new 30-member Agro-Terrorism Task Force.\nTask force co-Chairman Jeff Fisher, who heads UGA's environmental health science department, said the purpose of the gathering was to raise awareness of agro-terrorism among front line agricultural professionals and recruit them for a statewide effort to speed the reporting of plant and animal diseases.\nUGA is the site of one of eight centers for domestic preparedness funded by the CDC to develop standards for dealing with bioterrorism. Cham Dallas heads the university center that is developing national standards for pharmacology, emergency medicine and agro-terrorism.\nTo accomplish the task, Dallas has enlisted the help of researchers at Emory University, Georgia Tech and the Medical College of Georgia.\n\"The cooperative agreements are one of the things I'm most proud of,\" Dallas said during a tour of a laboratory where toxic agents are tested. Dallas, who studied the effects of radiation from the 1986 explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine, said the aftermath of agro-terrorism could dwarf those of the world's worst nuclear disaster.\nOn Friday, federal officials announced that Georgia will receive $2.3 million to combat agro-terrorism. Of that amount, $2 million will go to programs for rapid detection and diagnosis of plant and animal diseases.\nThe money is considered a wise investment against diseases that could cost hundreds of times that amount.\nAgriculture is Georgia's largest industry, representing an economic impact of $5.7 billion annually. Poultry production, including meat and eggs, contributes about $2.7 billion. Other significant agricultural products are cotton, peanuts, cattle and tobacco.\n\"Georgia's continued economic vitality is dependent upon freedom from disease, pests and disruption of commerce,\" Myers said. \"An agro-terror attack could quickly devastate trade, induce social instability and erode public confidence.\"\nAn outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Britain in 2001 cost the British economy $20 billion and effectively ended that country's beef export trade. A study by Georgia officials found that a single cow infected with foot-and-mouth disease could cost the state's economy more than $3 billion.\nDespite large sums of new money being spent to improve agricultural safety, the nation's food supply remains vulnerable, public health authority Stephen O. Cunnion wrote in the May issue of the Journal of Homeland Defense. The results could be devastating.\n\"Hysteria could overburden all social, economic and governmental systems, resulting in anarchy and bringing economic production to a standstill,\" Cunnion said. \"We have seen what a few ounces of anthrax can do to our postal system.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPhoto: Cham Dallas (front), director of the mass destruction defense center at UGA, and toxicology research coordinator Ed Rollor at the inhalation toxicology facility in Athens. / ANDY KJELLGREN / Special; Graphic: FEDERAL FUNDING TO COMBAT AGRO-TERRORISM\nSoutheastern states\nAlabama\nAnimal disease surveillance..................$51,841\nAnimal disease response................… $131,486\nPlant pest and disease detection........… $75,000\nRapid detection and diagnostics network............0\nTotal..................................… $258,327\nFlorida\nAnimal disease surveillance..................$69,407\nAnimal disease response................… $162,045\nPlant pest and disease detection............$350,000\nRapid detection and diagnostics network.. $1,650,000\nTotal................................… $2,231,451\nGeorgia\nAnimal disease surveillance..................$53,095\nAnimal disease response................… $133,669\nPlant pest and disease detection........… $75,000\nRapid detection and diagnostics network.. $2,000,000\nTotal................................… $2,261,764\nLouisiana\nAnimal disease surveillance..................$35,530\nAnimal disease response................… $103,112\nPlant pest and disease detection........… $50,000\nRapid detection and diagnostics network… $750,000\nTotal..................................… $938,642\nMississippi\nAnimal disease surveillance..................$42,222\nAnimal disease response................… $114,753\nPlant pest and disease detection........… $75,000\nRapid detection and diagnostics network............0\nTotal..................................… $231,975\nNorth Carolina\nAnimal disease surveillance..................$94,082\nAnimal disease response................… $204,971\nPlant pest and disease detection........… $75,000\nRapid detection and diagnostics network… $750,000\nTotal................................… $1,124,053\nSouth Carolina\nAnimal disease surveillance..............… $30,512\nAnimal disease response......................$94,381\nPlant pest and disease detection........… $75,000\nRapid detection and diagnostics network............0\nTotal..................................… $199,893\nTennessee\nAnimal disease surveillance..............… $81,953\nAnimal disease response................… $183,871\nPlant pest and disease detection........… $75,000\nRapid detection and diagnostics network............0\nTotal..................................… $340,824\nSoutheast total\nAnimal disease surveillance............… $458,642\nAnimal disease response..............… $1,128,288\nPlant pest and disease detection............$850,000\nRapid detection and diagnostics network.. $5,150,000\nTotal................................… $7,586,929\nU.S. total\nAnimal disease surveillance..........… $4,500,000\nAnimal disease response..................$14,000,000\nPlant pest and disease detection..........$4,335,000\nRapid detection and diagnostics network..$20,600,000\nTotal................................… $43,435,000\nSource: USDA\n\nLoad-Date: June 2, 2002"
