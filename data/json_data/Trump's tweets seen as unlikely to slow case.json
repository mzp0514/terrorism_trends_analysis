In another tweet, Trump said prosecutors \"Should move fast. DEATH PENALTY!\nSome legal experts said judges in Manhattan's federal courts will not let the president's remarks slow the case or throw it off track, especially in a courthouse with a quarter-century record of swift terrorism prosecutions with mostly airtight outcomes.\n\"Nothing slows down the train, said James Cohen, a professor at Fordham Law School. He said the yet-to-be-assigned judge will question prospective jurors to ensure they can be fair despite anything they might have heard or read.\nKaren Greenberg, director of the Center on National Security at Fordham Law School and a frequent observer at terrorism trials, said: \"Because this is in federal court, this will happen both speedily and without it interfering with the normal process of the trial.\nIn bringing terrorism charges against Saipov that could bring the death penalty, federal prosecutors Wednesday said the Uzbek immigrant used a rental truck to mow down people along a bike path after being inspired by Islamic State propaganda videos.\nInvestigators continued poring over Saipov's phone records and online contacts and combing surveillance footage to reconstruct his movements in the weeks before the rampage. They also interviewed friends and family, including his wife.\nAt one point, the FBI put out a bulletin seeking any information on a fellow Uzbek immigrant, Mukhammadzoir Kadirov, but quickly canceled it after locating him.\nA law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity said Kadirov was a friend of Saipov's and may not have a role in the case at all, but authorities got suspicious because he \"went off the radar when they went to speak with him. He was questioned and released.\nJohn Miller, the New York Police Department's deputy commissioner for counterterrorism and intelligence, told CBS that authorities so far believe Saipov acted alone.\nAlso Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions told members of law enforcement in New York in a visit scheduled before the attack that the U.S. justice system can handle suspects like Saipov.\nHe noted over 500 defendants have been convicted of terrorism-related crimes since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\nSaipov is being held without bail at a Manhattan federal lockup next to the courthouse. His attorney, David Patton, has said he hopes \"everyone lets the judicial process play out. He did not respond to a request for comment Thursday.\nOn Wednesday, Trump called the U.S. justice system a slow-moving \"joke and \"laughingstock and said he would be open to seeing Saipov transferred to the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where enemy combatants are tried by military tribunals.\nBut the president appeared to reverse course a day later, tweeting that \"statistically that process takes much longer than going through the Federal system.\nJustice can, in fact, be swift in Manhattan's federal courts. Two weeks ago, a jury took four hours to convict a man in a September 2016 bombing in New York City that wounded 30 people.\nIn 1994, four men were sentenced to life in prison 15 months after they carried out a February 1993 World Trade Center bombing that killed six people and injured over 1,000 others.\nAttorney Ron Kuby, who represented a blind Egyptian sheik sentenced to life in prison after a Manhattan terrorism trial, said Trump's tweets, if anything, could work against his desire to see the death penalty.\n\"Particularly in New York, if he's for it, we're against it, Kuby said. But \"it's nothing that is going to affect the compass course of good ship justice.\n\nLoad-Date: November 3, 2017"
