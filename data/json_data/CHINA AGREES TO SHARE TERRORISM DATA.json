We need it. We must use it,\" he said.\nPowell noted that 29 of the 34 OAS member lost citizens in the terrorist attacks last week.\nAt day's end, Powell met at the State Department with John Manley, the Canadian foreign secretary, and praised Canada's solidarity with the United States since the terrorist attacks.\nPowell recalled that 100,000 Canadians assembled in Ottawa, the capital, in a show of support.\n\"The American people will be forever grateful,\" Powell said.\n\nLoad-Date: September 23, 2001"
