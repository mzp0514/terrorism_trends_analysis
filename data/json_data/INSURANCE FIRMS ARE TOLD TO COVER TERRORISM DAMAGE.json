Also withdrawn was a request from 12 insurers, all in one insurance group, to exclude terrorism-related damage from private passenger auto policies.\nWhile Lakin said it has been difficult for insurers to buy insurance to cover their own losses since the Sept. 11 attacks, Missouri consumers also need protection.\n\"Particularly in the case of auto, home and health lines, it is very difficult to assert that insurers now face such an unpredictable and potentially expensive loss that they can drop such coverage from policies and leave Missourians totally unprotected,\" Lakin said.\nLakin said the agency has not yet addressed life and health insurance as it pertains to acts of terrorism but expects the state's position to differ little from its stance on auto and homeowner plans.\nJoe Annotti, a spokesman for the National Association of Independent Insurers based in suburban Chicago, said the Missouri approach was reasonable.\n\"It's pretty much standard operating procedure that most state insurance departments have taken,\" Annotti said Friday in a telephone interview. \"It sounds like they are acting responsibly.\"\nBrent Butler, a lobbyist for the Missouri Insurance Coalition, which represents about 100 insurers, said his only concern was how terrorism would be defined with regard to policies.\n\"Terrorism can be defined in many different ways,\" Butler said.\n\nNotes\n\nLOCAL\n\nLoad-Date: March 30, 2002"
