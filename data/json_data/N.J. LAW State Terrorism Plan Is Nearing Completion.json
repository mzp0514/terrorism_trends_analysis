    "full text": "The state is nearly finished drafting its emergency plans to deal with a terrorist strike, Attorney General David Samson says.\n     A task force created weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and on the Pentagon has completed its work and its report is being reviewed by the state's top security officials, Mr. Samson said last week. \n The same State Police department that helps guide emergency services through weather disasters has been designated to coordinate the action.\n\"It's as good a response plan as exists in this nation,\" Mr. Samson said in a recent interview.\nAfter taking office, Governor McGreevey signed an executive order demanding that New Jersey identify terrorism targets and look at ways to secure them.\nSince then, the state has canvassed nearly every major business in New Jersey, inviting representatives to join committees and share plans.\nThe key is collaboration, Mr. Samson said. All levels of government must cooperate to share intelligence and resources, and the government must reach to businesses like power utilities, pharmaceutical companies, media organizations and telecommunications services.\n\"So many of the targets which terrorists will find attractive are civilian targets, not military targets,\" Mr. Samson said.\nNew Jersey also has hired several consultants, many with Defense Department experience, Mr. Samson said, to help the state learn more about defending against terrorism attacks involving radiation, biological or chemical weapons.\nBut detailed information about the overall security plan will not be made public, Mr. Samson said.\n\"There has to be, in order for this system to work well, some consideration given to the government to protect this information,\" he said.\nGovernor McGreevey recently signed an executive order that limits the release of public records, citing security concerns. The order has raised concerns about too many restrictions on access.\nAs attorney general, Mr. Samson is charged with reviewing complaints about the new public records law and deciding what should be released.\n\"We're going to deal with this with a scalpel, not a saber or a broad sword. We want to do this with the balance that's necessary to protect the public,\" he said. --------------------\n\nHomeland Security Conference\nATLANTIC CITY (AP) -- The United States Army is planning a homeland security symposium to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.\nThe 2002 Homeland Security and National Defense Symposium, sponsored by the Fort Monmouth-based Army Communications Electronics Command, will highlight technological initiatives designed to support soldiers, combat terrorism and provide homeland defense.\nAbout 1,500 military officials, civilian contractors and emergency management officials are expected to attend the event, which runs from Sept. 9 through Sept. 13 at the Atlantic City Convention Center.\n\nThe On Politics column does not appear today. It will resume next week.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: July 28, 2002"
