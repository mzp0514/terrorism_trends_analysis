    "full text": "A KEY MEMBER of the House Financial Services Committee had some good news for risk managers the other day, and he chose a rather unusual venue in which to deliver it.\nSpeaking at a conference on financial matters put together by the Consumer Federation of America, Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., said that one of the House panel's first orders of business when the new Congress convenes early next year will be to extend the federal government's terrorism insurance backstop program.\nThe fact that the CFA has been one of the most vocal opponent of extending the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, which is slated to expire at the end of next year, did not deter Rep. Kanjorski from not only endorsing extension of the program but advocating its expansion to include group life insurance as well.\nIf the choice of venue was a bit of surprise, Rep Kanjorski's position was not. He has supported the extension of TRIA ever since the issue emerged last year, and for good reason. As Rep. Kanjorski told his audience, the private terrorism insurance market TRIA was designed, in part, to foster has not emerged. Without some kind of guarantee that affordable terrorism coverage will be available-a guarantee provided by TRIA-the economy will not perform to its full potential.\nThe House Financial Services Committee gave its unanimous approval to a TRIA extension bill in September, but Congress adjourned before either the full House or Senate could consider extension. The committee has its priorities straight by taking up the issue early in the next Congress. We hope that the House and Senate recognize the importance of renewing TRIA as soon as possible and add its extension to their lists of early priorities as well.\n\nLoad-Date: December 8, 2004"
