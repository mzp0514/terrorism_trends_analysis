He can't do it for someone as major as Osama bin Laden, and he can't do it for someone as lowly as a suspected extremist in Karachi.\nThat, he says, would be truly revolutionary.\n\"If you are able to touch that data all at one time, you can create new knowledge by pulling in things that have a relationship that you didn't know existed otherwise,\" said Brennan, a 23-year CIA veteran and Middle East expert.\nInquiries into the Sept. 11 attacks made clear the importance of sharing information. In one now-infamous July 2001 memo, an FBI officer in Arizona warned that bin Laden might be trying to coordinate efforts to send Islamic extremists to U.S. flight schools. Known as the \"Phoenix memo,\" it got lost inside the FBI and wasn't acted upon.\nIn his 2003 State of the Union address, President Bush announced the formation of TTIC, (pronounced Tee-Tick), to bring together employees from the FBI, CIA, the Defense Department and elsewhere to \"merge and analyze all threat information in a single location.\" Today, the center has several hundred employees.\nBut some in Congress wonder why the agency hasn't yet linked all the computer systems.\nBrennan said the center is trying to bring disparate computer systems together.\n\"The bumper-sticker comments about we're not sharing information don't take into account the complexity of the issue,\" he said.\nBrennan and his chief information officer, William Spalding, say each government agency has developed its own networks over more than two decades. Even internally, Brennan notes, the CIA today can't do a single search against all the computer networks it has.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nThe new Terrorist Threat Integration Center at an undisclosed location in the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., has adopted the spy agency look. Each office is essentially a vault, with a coded lock to get in. The external windows are bullet- and blast-proof.\nMug - John Brennan\n\nLoad-Date: October 16, 2004"
