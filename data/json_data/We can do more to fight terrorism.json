    "full text": "The news program \"60 Minutes\" ran a segment on ISIS. It showed the destruction of Christian communities. It presented the voices of religious leaders calling for more military involvement.\nWhat is missing from \"60 Minutes\" is any inquiry whatsoever as to who ISIS is and who is funding their terrorism. Before we as U.S. citizens are taken into yet more war, let us consider the following.\nIn 2014, Karen Armstrong published her latest book, \"Fields of Blood: Religion and the History of Violence.\" She illustrates well how religion can be used by political and economic entities to justify violence.\nI agree with President Obama that ISIS does not represent Islam. ISIS represents interlopers who are using religion to disguise their terrorism.\nWe have the power to illegally intercept every U.S. citizen's email, but we're supposed to believe our government can't trace the funding? And can we not arrest them and bring them to trial?\nIn this age of multinational corporate powers that want to be bigger than nations, we really need to ask these questions.\nWe should be investigating with every means available, our ability to follow the money trail behind today's terrorists. In this age of Citizens United, freedom of speech has been defined as money. The foreign influence of multinational corporations can manipulate our political and economic infrastructure. We must not be so naive as to overlook how religion - the most emotional human institution can be exploited for war profiteering and more fossil fuel sources in Syria.\n\nLoad-Date: March 28, 2015"
