    "full text": "Terrorism took an ominous turn in Vienna recently when Evner Ergun, a United Nations official since 1967, was killed by an Armenian gunman. Mr. Ergun's reputation was excellent, and his sole ''crime'' was his citizenship. He was a Turk.\nTopics editorial deplores assassination of Evner Ergun, Turkish UN official, in Vienna by Armenian gunman; says Armenian cause is not merely hurt by killing diplomats and civil servants, it is dishonored\nScores of Turkish diplomats have been killed by the Armenian terrorists. The avowed purpose is to call attention to the mass murder of Armenians under the Ottoman Empire during World War I. But in branding a whole people as guilty, the Armenians are doing to others precisely what was done to their ancestors.\nThe Vienna crime was the more outrageous because the victim was not a Turkish official. At a memorial for Mr. Ergun, Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar made the necessary point: ''The international civil servant is neither the advocate nor the opponent of any national or group interest . . . It passes all comprehension that he should become the object of any vendetta.'' Most Armenians repudiate terrorism and ask only that Turkey acknowledge an indefensible historic wrong. But their cause is not merely hurt by killing diplomats and civil servants; it is dishonored."
