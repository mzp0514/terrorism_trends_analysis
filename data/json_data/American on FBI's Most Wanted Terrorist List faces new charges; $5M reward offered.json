Officials believe he is now in Somalia.\n \"Al-Shabab's reign of terror threatens U.S. national security, our international allies and innocent civilians,\" U.S. Attorney Robert Brewer said in a statement. \"Today, we seek the public's assistance in capturing Mostafa and disrupting al-Shabab.\"\n The announcement came as authorities unsealed a \"superseding indictment\" expanding charges against Mostafa, who was initially indicted 10 years ago, to include terrorism-related offenses that occurred from March 2008 to February 2017, the news release said. Prosecutors believe Mostafa \"conspired to provide material support, including himself as personnel, to terrorists; conspired to provide material support to al-Shabab, a designated foreign terrorist organization (FTO); and provided material support to al-Shabab,\" according to the release.\n The U.S. State Department first offered a $5 million reward for \"information leading to the arrest and conviction of Mostafa\" in 2013, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. That reward is still available, the news release said.\n If you have information about Mostafa's whereabouts, call 1-800-CALL-FBI or visit tips.fbi.gov.\n Read more here.\n\nLoad-Date: December 5, 2019"
