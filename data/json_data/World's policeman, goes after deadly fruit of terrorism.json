    "full text": "Having assumed the role of \"World's Policeman,\" America finds that the machinery set into motion for the eradication of terrorism will spur her toward conflict with other nations.\nNations that nurture the sort of bad seed that bears the intolerant, deadly fruit of terrorism.\nDid not the president declare that any country that supported or in any way sheltered any terrorist organization would be asked to step outside and settle it in the parking lot, the same as Iraq?\nIf America means what she says, this bellicose stance should cause her to be placed in the jungles of South America's cocaine cartels as well as the Teutonic, cathedral-specked streets of Europe and Ireland.\nIn retrospect, it would seem that such policy carried out can only restore and enhance America's role among the world powers that suspected this effort was directed against Islam.\nIt was not. Every American knows it.\nThe war with Iraq bears no more significance to religion than did the involvements with Korea or Vietnam represent an American conflict with Buddhism.\nNow is the time for the rest of the world to know it.\nAs the war with Iraq draws to a conclusion, the United States should waste no time in the pursuance of its doctrine of the eradication of terrorism.\nRick Flannagan\nHurricane\n\nLoad-Date: April 15, 2003"
