They took the luggage with them and left the device behind, the police source said.\nGov. Cuomo, who toured the scene early Sunday with Mayor de Blasio, said nothing so far linked the explosions to any overseas extremist groups. But a bomb going off in the city was \"obviously an act of terrorism,\" he added.\n\"When you see the damage, we were fortunate there were no fatalities,\" he said.\nThe mayor wouldn't say it was a terrorist act, saying only that it was \"intentional.\"\nThe bomb that exploded was dropped in a dumpster near a residence for the blind. Its ground-shaking detonation blew out windows and sent shrapnel flying as pedestrians ran for their lives.\nThe NYPD said that bomb was \"similar\" to the second device found four blocks away on W. 27th St. three hours later by two state troopers after a Chelsea photographer, Jane Schreibman, spotted the \"weird\" device on the street. Schreibman, 66, thought the device might be a children's science project, but decided to call 911 to be on the safe side.\"The materials found, twisted metal, are consistent with the type of metal used in cookware, including pressure cookers,\" said a police source.\nBoth devices were filled with small ball bearings or metal BBs, The New York Times reported, similar to the pressure-cooker bombs the Tsarnaev brothers detonated at the Boston Marathon in 2013. The NYPD issued a heightened alert for the city after the bomb squad realized the second device was \"live\" - meaning it could have gone off if it hadn't been found, the source said. Cops also checked out a Tumblr page posted Sunday from someone claiming responsibility for the violence.\n\"I'm the NY Bomber,\" the page (inset) declared, above a \"manifesto\" that said the blasts were meant to further gay rights and bring attention to LGBTQ issues.\nThe site was being vetted like all tips, officials said, and later discredited.\nAn unknown man also called an NYPD facility right after the bomb went off and told cops \"there is going to be more,\" the source said. But it wasn't clear if the caller had any connection to the blast or was just an angry person, the source said.\nThe unexploded device was removed about 2:25 a.m. and defused late Sunday.\nSome of the evidence would be sent to an FBI lab in Quantico, Va., for analysis, Cuomo said.\nAfter de Blasio's rare public appearance alongside Cuomo - the two actually briefly embraced after chatting with residents in the neighbhorhood - the the mayor held a press briefing with his new top cop, Police Commissioner James O'Neill.\n\"It was intentional. It was a violent act. It was certainly a criminal act. It was a bombing. That's what we know,\" de Blasio said.\nThe mayor and NYPD officials said investigators were exploring whether the Chelsea bombing was connected to an explosion of pipe bombs earlier Saturday in New Jersey but didn't give details.\nBut law enforcement officials found that all three devices were designed to be detonated using a cell phone as a trigger, ABC News reported, citing police sources.\nAl Della Fave, spokesman for the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office, said the FBI took over its probe Sunday.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nMayor de Blasio and Gov.
