    "full text": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Local police, firefighters, medics and other emergency workers in 120 cities may get help dealing with the threat of a terrorist strike with chemical or biological weapons.\nThe Pentagon, in cooperation with other federal agencies, has begun sending teams to cities across the country to decide what assistance they might require. The program envisions teaching emergency teams to identify such deadly weapons, deal with victims and carry out any decontamination that might be required, officials said Wednesday at a Pentagon briefing.\nUnder this year's $42.6 million program, the military will set up a multi-service ''Chem-Bio Quick Response Force'' of up to 500 people. Members of the force will travel around the country training local officials. A hotline and an Internet site are to be established, and specialized training also will be done at some military installations.\nThe commander of the Army's Chemical Biological Defense Command, Maj. Gen. George Friel, will be in charge of the training program. Friel is based at Aberdeen, Md.\nRep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., a member of the House National Security Committee who has pressed for such help for local authorities, called the Pentagon program ''a good step . . . long overdue, but it's not enough.''\n''The first responder to terrorism is not the military,'' Weldon said. ''It's the 1.2 million men and women across the country who day in and day out respond to disasters.'' He said local emergency workers, many of them volunteers, could be overwhelmed before federal assistance could arrive.\nCarl Hooker, deputy chief of the Houston Fire Department, welcomed the program.\n''There's no way cities can prepare properly for something like that,'' Hooker said in an interview. ''No question about it, it will make us more secure in dealing with a terrorist event.''\nHooker said interest in dealing with such a crisis has grown, particularly since the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building that killed 168 people.\nAs Saturday's bombing anniversary nears, federal agencies are quietly fortifying security. The FBI sent out a reminder about the date and its history. Some agencies issued precautions about reporting suspicious events, abandoned packages and the like.\nPentagon officials said the training will be coordinated through the Federal Emergency Management Agency and will make use of experts from the FBI, the Public Health Service, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Department.\nBy Oct. 1, 27 cities will be assessed for setting up the initial programs. Over the next three years, the officials said, they hope to reach the nation's 120 largest cities - if those cities want to take part.\nDenver offered to be the pilot city for the program, and a team arrived there Monday to assess its needs. Besides Denver, the next eight cities to be studied are New York; Los Angeles; Chicago; Wash-ington; Houston; Kansas City, Kan; San Diego; and Philadelphia.\nThe remaining are Detroit; Dallas; Phoenix; San Antonio; San Jose, Calif.; Baltimore; Indianapolis; San Francisco; Jacksonville, Fla.; Columbus, Ohio; Milwaukee; Memphis, Tenn.; Boston; Seattle; Atlanta; Honolulu; Miami; and Anchorage, Alaska.\n\nLoad-Date: April 3, 1998"
