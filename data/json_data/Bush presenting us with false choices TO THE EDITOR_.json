    "full text": "When President Bush visited the Lancaster Host Resort on Aug. 16, I held a banner saying \"Communism Fell Peacefully - War Won't End Terrorism.\"\nHaving lived in West Germany between 1981 and 1983, and in communist Poland from 1983 until 1986, I believe there are some facts about our victory in the Cold War Bush and other pro-Iraq war Americans should consider.\nBush has been feeding us false choices such as \"either you are with us or you are with the terrorists\" and \"either we continue to occupy Iraq or we cut and run.\"\nThe phrase, \"better Red than dead\" also was a false choice. Being dead is obviously undesirable (as the TV show about a nuclear war hitting America, \"The Day After,\" depicted) so is the gray stagnation of communist control (as another TV series, \"Amerika,\" imagined).\nIn the early 1980s, both the hawks who wanted more weapons against the Soviets and the doves who worried about accidental nuclear war were focusing on the wrong thing - physical weapons instead of the people themselves. It was the people who lived under Communism such as Vaclav Havel, Lech Walesa and Pope John Paul II and their millions of followers who ended communist rule by continuing to press in peaceful means for more openness and better living conditions. They were aided by Western policies that did not threaten their leaders with invasion (which gives excuses for the most repressive regimes or militias to expand force and repression in self defense) but invited them to participate in a social system of rule of law and human rights and freedom.\nIn Iraq, the Bush administration has made the same mistake an earlier generation made in Vietnam - the mistake of thinking you can defeat an ideology with a military occupation. The mistake Westerners made through most of the Cold War was to concentrate on weapons hardware and ignore the sentiments of the ordinary people in the countries we called \"the enemy.\"\nTo reduce terrorism, as we all want to do, we must pay maximum attention to the root causes of why anyone would want to become a terrorist, just as in the Marshall Plan and the rebuilding of European prosperity we addressed the root causes of why a disgruntled worker would want to support the communists. Our Cold War policy finally worked in Europe without a war, and if we want to reduce terrorism, we must learn from the success of that policy.\nRichard Paul Moyer\nEphrata\n\nLoad-Date: August 30, 2006"
