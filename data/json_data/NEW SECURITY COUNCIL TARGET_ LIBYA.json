    "full text": "The three countries with reasons to go after Libya for acts of terrorism wisely have chosen to direct their efforts through the U.N. Security Council, of which they are permanent members. If action is taken to bring Libyan agents to justice, this is the way to go about it.\nThe time involved will be longer, but violence and retaliation may be avoided this way.  The United States, Britain and France all have charges against Libya relating to two airline bombings believed to have been the work of Libyan agents. The three countries are starting a drive to get Security Council endorsement of a cutoff of air service to Libya. This would include stopping all commercial flights, prohibiting the sale of commercial planes and spare parts and any airline-related services.  In separate but related indictments, Britain and the United States are demanding that Libya extradite two intelligence agents believed to have been part of the bombing in December 1988 of Pan American Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. Two hundred seventy people died in the explosion.  And the French government accuses Libyan agents of planting a bomb on a French jetliner in 1989 that exploded over Niger, killing 170 people.  That Libya under Col. Moammar Gadhafi is a problem for other countries is not at issue. It must be made to account for its actions if, indeed, its agents planted bombs on commercial aircraft. What is at issue is how responsible countries react, through the instruments of the United Nations first used so successfully after Iraq invaded Kuwait. Col. Gadhafi should begin to reconsider his long-held love of terrorism as an instrument of his foreign policy. The United Nations has shown that it can act effectively.\n\nLoad-Date: October 13, 1993"
