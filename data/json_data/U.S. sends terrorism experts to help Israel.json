    "full text": "The Clinton administration is sending experts in diplomatic security and counterterrorism to help Israel. They also will train Yasser Arafat's Palestinian forces.\nAlready, a team of FBI agents is in Israel and additional agents will follow once Israel tells the United States what kind of specialists it needs, a Justice Department official said Tuesday.\nThe FBI team and a legal specialist from the bureau's office in Athens, Greece, were assigned to help the Israelis after a suicide bombing in Jerusalem Feb. 25. Three deadly bombings followed, killing 61 people, including four Americans.\nThe head of the State Department's counterterrorism office, Philip C. Wilcox Jr., who also has run the Israeli desk at the department, probably will head the counterterrorist group, a State Department official said.\nOn Tuesday, at President Clinton's direction, bomb-detection equipment was flown to Israel to help intercept terrorists at border crossings.\nClinton said his aim was to \"support the fight against future terrorist attacks, to bring killers to justice and to rally support for peace in the Middle East.\"\nA senior U.S. official said Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority forces would be trained to use the American devices. Presidential spokesman Mike McCurry said the equipment being sent now and later was to help both Israel and the Palestinians combat a terrorist threat.\nSecretary of State Warren Christopher said Iran was deeply involved, financing, training, perhaps even directing groups such as Hamas, the militant Islamic organization that claimed responsibility for the four bombings.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nAP graphic - U.S. assistance\n\nLoad-Date: December 9, 1996"
