    "full text": "Hours after the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, an unmanned Predator drone was sent over the U.S. post, CBS News has reported. \nU.S. officials told The Washington Post that there were no American surveillance drones over the compounds until the next morning, when evacuations were under way, meaning there was no aerial footage to show how the attack began. \nThe State Department, White House and Pentagon declined to say what military options, if any, had been available.  \nA White House official told CBS News that, at the start of the attack, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Martin Dempsey and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta \"looked at available options, and the ones we exercised had our military forces arrive in less than 24 hours, well ahead of timelines laid out in established policies.\"  \nIt was too late to help the Americans in Benghazi. Four of them were dead. \nIn the night, a \"small group of reinforcements\" was sent from the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli and reached the security compound, the White House said. \nRetired CIA officer Gary Berntsen told CBS that help could have come much sooner. He commanded CIA counter-terrorism missions targeting Osama bin Laden and led the team that responded after bombings of the U.S. Embassy in East Africa. \n\"You find a way to make this happen,\" Berntsen says. \"There isn't a plan for every single engagement. Sometimes you have to be able to make adjustments. They made zero adjustments in this. They stood and they watched and our people died.\"  \nThe Pentagon did say it moved a special-ops team from central Europe to the Naval Air Station in Sigonella, Italy, but gave no other details. Sigonella is just an hour's flight from Libya. \n\nLoad-Date: October 29, 2012"
