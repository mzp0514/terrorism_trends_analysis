    "full text": "To the Editor:\n  In ''My Plan for Iraq'' (Op-Ed, July 14), Senator Barack Obama correctly points out that the Taliban and Al Qaeda are resurgent and daily launch cross-border terrorist attacks in Afghanistan from safe sanctuaries in Pakistan. \n  The threat facing Afghanistan and global security is constant and dynamic. Taliban and Qaeda terrorists have increasingly become sophisticated in carrying out attacks against civilian and military targets, killing more than 30 American soldiers alone since early June. To stem these deadly attacks, both an increase in NATO troops and a regional approach to the problem of terrorism are required, as Senator Obama notes. An additional three well-equipped brigades of roughly 10,000 troops would greatly increase the coalition's capacity to fight cross-border terrorism in Afghanistan.\n  Additionally, to expand the reach and effectiveness of counterinsurgency, it is imperative to accelerate the process of training and equipping the Afghan security forces so that they can conduct independent operations deep into the Taliban's territory. \n  Meanwhile, Pakistan should support these efforts by pursuing a two-pronged strategy to subvert the Qaeda and Taliban leadership and to dismantle their operational infrastructure in the country's well-known urban and tribal hideouts. \n  Backed by Afghanistan and its other allies, Pakistan has the military and intelligence capabilities to achieve this strategic objective for peace at home and security in Afghanistan and the region.\n  M. Ashraf Haidari  Political Counselor  Embassy of Afghanistan Washington, July 15, 2008\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: July 21, 2008"
