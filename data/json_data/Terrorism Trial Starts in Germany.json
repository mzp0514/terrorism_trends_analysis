But, he added, \"I didn't know that beforehand and I didn't meet him either.\"\nMr. El Motassadeq, in custody since his arrest in Hamburg two months after the attacks, faces a possible life sentence if convicted of membership in a terrorist organization and more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder.\nHis attorneys told the court he is innocent and denies prosecutors' charges that he provided logistical support to the Hamburg cell, which included hijacker Mohamed Atta and two of the other pilots.\n\nLoad-Date: March 25, 2004"
