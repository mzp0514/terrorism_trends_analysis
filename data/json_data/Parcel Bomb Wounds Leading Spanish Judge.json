    "full text": "A parcel bomb severely wounded the president of Madrid's High Court today, the police said.\nThe president, 60-year-old Fernando de Mateo Lage, is the highest ranking judge assigned to terrorism cases in Spain.\nThe court, the Audiencia Nacional, is responsible for all terrorism cases and Government officials indicated that the attack bore the hallmark of E.T.A., the Basque separatist group.\n''This method has been used before,'' said Justice Minister Jose Luis Corcuera. ''It is most likely that the same people are responsible.''\nThe book-sized bomb exploded while the judge was opening his mail in his study at home. He lost both his hands and may lose his eyesight.\nPolice officials said the parcel, which arrived with the midmorning mail, was given clearance for delivery by the Civil Guard on duty. The parcel carried an official Justice Ministry stamp.\nToday's attack came after statements by Justice Minister Corcuera at the weekend that the Government would be prepared to resume peace talks in exchange for a six-month truce by E.T.A. Herri Batasuna, considered E.T.A.'s political wing, said at a press conference today just hours before the attack that the time was ripe for a resumption of talks.\nTalks between the Government and E.T.A. were broken off last year."
