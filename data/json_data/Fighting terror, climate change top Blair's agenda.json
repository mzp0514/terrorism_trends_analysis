    "full text": "LONDON -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair will focus on fighting terrorism, combating climate change and changing the pension system in his last Queen's Speech on Wednesday.\nBlair and his top ministers have signaled that those issues will top his last legislative agenda as prime minister before stepping down from the job next year. \nSpecifically:\n*Terrorism. Blair said Friday that the threat from terrorists is \"very real\" and could take a generation to defeat. His remarks came as the head of Britain's domestic spy agency, MI5, said Muslim extremists in Britain are plotting 30 major terrorist attacks. Blair will push for greater police powers to seize terrorists' assets, and also for national identity cards. He said Nov. 6 that the cards can help stem illegal immigration.\n*Climate change. Blair seeks to encourage new technology to reduce carbon emissions and dependency on fossil fuel. The issue was highlighted here Oct. 30, when Nicholas Stern, former chief economist for the World Bank, warned that up to 20% of the world's gross economic output is in jeopardy. On Nov. 3, Blair urged German Chancellor Angela Merkel to seek an international agreement to cut emissions when Germany takes over next year as the head of the G-8 group of industrial democracies.\n*Pension system changes. Blair wants a more flexible pension system that would help women who take career breaks to raise children claim pensions. Blair's pensions secretary, John Hutton, told Sky News that people who watch Wednesday's speech will see how the government is addressing big challenges, such as changes in the pension system. \n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO, B/W, Getty Images\n\nLoad-Date: November 14, 2006"
