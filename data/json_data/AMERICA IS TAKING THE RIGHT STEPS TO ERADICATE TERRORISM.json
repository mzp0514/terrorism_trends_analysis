    "full text": "This letter is in response to the March 17 Associated Press story \"Spain's Leader: Iraq Occupation a 'Fiasco,' \" which ran on the PG's Web site. Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero explains that \"fighting terrorism with bombs . . . with Tomahawk missiles, isn't the way to defeat terrorism\" and that \"terrorism is combated by the state of law.\"\nWhile I agree that law enforcement and intelligence are as important in fighting terrorism as, say, our operations in Afghanistan, both attack only the symptoms, not the root of the problem. If Osama bin Laden were killed tomorrow, terrorism would not go away -- another monster driven by religious and cultural hatred would pop up to take his place. The root problem is the acute sense of despair that permeates the Middle East. It is a lack of opportunity and freedom that is centuries old, frustrating and gnawing at the population.\n It has been reinforced, at times, by America's willingness to coddle or support dictators like Saddam Hussein and the Saudi royal family when it is convenient. The only way to defeat terrorism is with democracy and freedom -- that is why we see the terrorists so desperate to sabotage what has been started in Iraq.\n No, Mr. Zapatero, what America is doing in Iraq is the only way to erase the scourge of terrorism from the planet. Only the United States has the resources to lead such an ambitious endeavor, but we need the support of the people of the world to make it successful. Otherwise the devastation that Spain and the United States have felt March 11 and Sept. 11 will be repeated for generations to come.\n MARC N. PALMISIANO\n South Side\n\nLoad-Date: March 26, 2004"
