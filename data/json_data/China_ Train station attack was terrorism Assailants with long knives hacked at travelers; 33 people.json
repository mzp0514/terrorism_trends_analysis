One of them, Yang Ziqing, told Xinhua that they were waiting for a train to Shanghai when a knife-wielding man suddenly came at them.\n\"My two town-fellows' husbands have been rushed to hospital, but I can't find my husband, and his phone went unanswered,\" Yang sobbed.\nFootage on China's state broadcaster CCTV showed a heavy police presence near the station and plainclothes agents wrapping a long knife in a plastic bag as investigators collected evidence following the attacks.\nPictures on Sina Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, showed bodies covered in blood at the station.\nThe Security Management Bureau under the Ministry of Public Security called the incident a \"severe violent crime\" via its official Sina Weibo account.\nThe Kunming Railway Station, located in the southeastern area of the city, is one of the largest railway stations in southwest China.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n A woman reacts, at the crime scene outside a railway station after an attack, in Kunming, in southwestern China's Yunnan province, Saturday March 1, 2014.
