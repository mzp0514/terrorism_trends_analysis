Powell said yesterday.\nHe said he was working with the CIA, which helped to compile the data, to determine why the errors got into the report. \"Very embarrassing. I am not a happy camper over this. We were wrong,\" the secretary said on NBC's Meet the Press.\nPowell said he planned a meeting on the issue today and that the intelligence agency was working through the weekend in preparation.\n\"I'm not saying it is responsible until I sit down with all of the individuals who had something to do with this report: CIA, my department, members of my department, other agencies that contributed to it,\" Powell said.\n\"It's a numbers error. It's not a political judgment that said, 'Let's see if we can cook the books.' . . . Errors crept in,\" he said on ABC's This Week.\nHe pledged to release a corrected report as quickly as possible. \"I am regretful that this has happened. And we're going to get it fixed, we're going to get it corrected, and that's the best I can do,\" Powell said.\nRep. Henry A. Waxman (D., Calif.) had challenged the findings, contending they were manipulated for political purposes. The conclusion that terrorism was on the decline was used to boost one of President Bush's chief foreign policy claims, success in countering terror.\nWaxman asked Powell for an explanation and the secretary called last week to say the mistakes were unintentional.\n\"He says it wasn't politically motivated, so I will accept that,\" Waxman said after their conversation. \". . .We are still left with the fact that this report is useless until it is corrected.\"\nThe April report said attacks had declined last year to 190, down from 198 in 2002 and 346 in 2001. The 2003 figure would have been the lowest level in 34 years and a 45 percent drop since 2001, the first year of Bush's presidency.\nThe report also showed the virtual disappearance of attacks in which no one died.\n\"There's a new terrorist-threat information center that compiles this data under the CIA. And we are still trying to determine what went wrong with the data and why we didn't catch it in the State Department,\" Powell said yesterday. \"It's a very big mistake. And we are not happy about this big mistake.\"\nThe department has said that one of the mistakes was that only part of 2003 was taken into account.\nWhen the annual report was issued April 29, senior administration officials used it as evidence that the war was being won under Bush.\n\"We weren't saying terrorism has gone away. The report clearly says terrorism is a main problem facing the world today,\" Powell said.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO;\nColin L.
