    "full text": "The federal investigation into a Kent State University professor accused of having ties to the Islamic State remains ongoing almost four months after the accusations went public.\nS p e c i a l A ge n t V i c k i Anderson, an FBI spokeswoman, said investigators are still looking into the accusations against Julio Pino, an outspoken Muslim convert with a history of anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian rhetoric.\n\"I don't have anything to report on that just yet,\" she said. \"I'm sure we'll put something out the moment it moves to the next step.\"\nAccusations against Pino allege he used his classroom to recruit students to the Islamic State, which the U.S. includes on its list of terrorist groups. Pino has repeatedly denied any ties to the group, though he acknowledged his opinions on the Middle East were controversial.\nThe university has condemned Pino's opinions but declined to terminate or discipline him. Experts say he's protected by tenure.\nThe FBI has remained close-lipped about who levied allegations against Pino and whether any evidence has turned up.\nPublic records obtained in January showed none of his spring or summer 2015 students accused him of recruiting in the classroom.\nPino on Monday said his classes during the spring 2016 semester went without a hitch and he intends to return in the fall to teach classes.\nHe said the FBI has not communicated with him.\n\nLoad-Date: May 11, 2016"
