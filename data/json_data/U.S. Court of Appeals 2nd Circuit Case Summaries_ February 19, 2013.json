UBS AG 11-0211-cv Judges Kearse, Lohier and Droney\nBackground: The plaintiffs appealed from an order dismissing their complaint for lack of standing and failing to state an Anti-Terrorism Act claim against the defendant bank for facilitating terrorism by transferring U.S. Currency to Iran. The plaintiffs argue that their complaint alleged a chain of causation between the transfers of funds to Iran by UBS and the plaintiffs’ injuries at the hands of various terrorist groups sponsored by Iran. Such allegation was sufficient to establish traceability for both standing and stating a claim under ATA. Ruling: The Second Circuit affirmed. The court found that the plaintiffs had standing as their allegations of traceability were sufficient for the purposes of Article III. However, the court found that the plaintiffs failed to state a cognizable claim as their complaint did not provide sufficient proximate cause for the injuries. Nathaniel A. Tarnor for the plaintiffs-appellants; Jonathan Rosenberg for the defendant-appellee\nhttp://www.nydailyrecord.com/be-the-first-to-know/\">Click here for more from this resource. </a>\n8 2013 Dolan Media Newswires.
