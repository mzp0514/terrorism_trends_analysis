You have agreed to protect and defend the people of Texas, and we appreciate your service,\" he told the graduates.\n\"Every day of the year, and every minute of the hour there is a Texas State Trooper combating crime and terrorism throughout this great state, and when you leave here today you will be joining them on the frontline of this important battle,\" said Colonel Steven C. McCraw, Director of the Texas Department of Public Safety.\nThe troopers began the 18-week training academy in August.
