The Twin Towers attack took place on the second anniversary of the end of the Persian Gulf War.\nA well-placed Clinton administration official denied, however, that Yousef had actually implicated Iraq dictator Saddam Hussein in the bombing.\nLaw enforcement experts were jubilant that Yousef had decided to provide information so quickly after his arrest in Pakistan on Tuesday. These officials cautioned that any of his statements had to be viewed with skepticism until they could be independently verified.\nOne veteran law enforcement source noted that a degree of suspicion always exists when an alleged dedicated terrorist in such a huge case turns so helpful so suddenly. He said the possibility of disinformation could not be ruled out.\nYousef's arraignment yesterday marked the end of a career of terror for one of the world's most wanted men, sought after by a host of intelligence services stretching from the United States through Europe and the Middle East to Asia. A $ 2 million reward had been offered for his capture by the federal government.\n''The FBI has conducted a worldwide search for Yousef since he was charged shortly after the bombing on February 26, 1993,'' FBI director Louis J. Freeh said.\nA freshly shaved and nattily dressed Yousef, who wore a dark blazer, spoke flawless English during his five-minute arraignment in Federal Court in Manhattan. He declined the reading of the charges against him.\n''I plead not guilty,'' Yousef told Judge John Keenan in the same courthouse where Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman and 10 of his followers are on trial for plotting a series of terrorist attacks, including bombing the headquarters of the United Nations, two tunnels linking New York and New Jersey and the Manhattan field office of the FBI.\nYousef's capture already has led U.S. officials to open new avenues of inquiry into the bombing of the World Trade Center. The possibility of state-sponsored terrorism, always in the background after the attack, has been thrust into the limelight.\n''The Iraqi aspect of the investigation has always been pursued, and we're continuing to pursue it in the wake of Yousef's arrest. The role of state sponsorship is very much open and we will pursue it more now,'' a counterterrorism official said yesterday.\nDuring the 1990-91 Persian Gulf crisis, Hussein's regime attempted to carry out several terrorist attacks against Western targets, virtually all of which were foiled. Officials noted yesterday that terrorism remains one of the few weapons still available to Iraq, whose government is under Draconian economic sanctions and whose weapons of mass destruction have all but been destroyed.\n \nThe hunt for Yousef\n-- Yousef flees from the United States to Iraq via Pakistan after the Feb. 26, 1993, bombing of the World Trade Center in New York City that killed six people and injured 1,000.\n-- Yousef was reportedly in Bangkok, Thailand, last spring when an abortive attack was made on the Israeli Embassy there.\n-- Yousef is linked to a plot to kill Pope John Paul II during the pontiff's four-day visit to the Philippines last month.\n-- Yousef supposedly planned to blow up an American commercial airliner in Bangkok earlier this month but aborted the attack because of tight security at the airport. It was upon his return from Bangkok to Islamabad, Pakistan, that he was identified and shadowed by the authorities.\n-- Yousef is arrested in Islamabad on Tuesday and flown later that day to New York, where he was charged yesterday with 11 counts related to the World Trade Center bombing.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO, DRAWING, PHOTO: Ramzi Ahmed Yousef.
