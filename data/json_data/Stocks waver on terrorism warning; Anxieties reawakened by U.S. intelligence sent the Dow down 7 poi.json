They traded in a narrow range one day after the Dow Jones industrial average gained nearly 160 points.\n\"Right now, there's not that much that's going to push things higher, and that's fine,\" said Kevin Caron, market strategist for Ryan, Beck & Co.\n\"Barring a terrorist attack or a significant disruption in the economy, what you're going to be looking at is a rising market after the second-quarter earnings results come in around July and August,\" Caron added.\nThe Dow was down 7.73, or 0.1 percent, at 10,109.89.\nBroader stock indicators were higher. The Standard & Poor's 500 index was up 1.89, or 0.2 percent, at 1,114.94, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 11.50, or 0.6 percent, to 1,976.15.\nThe Commerce Department reported that orders for durable goods - products expected to last at least three years - dropped by 2.9 percent last month, the biggest one-month slide since September 2002.\nEconomists had expected a drop of 0.8 percent. However, orders rose substantially in February and March, leading most analysts to believe that the April drop is not the start of a trend.\nMeanwhile, new-home sales fell by 11.8 percent to 1.09 million units, the lowest level since November. The drop was blamed on higher mortgage rates. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in April was 5.83 percent, up from 5.45 percent in March.\nThe Mortgage Bankers said yesterday that new mortgage applications fell last week for the third straight week.\nThe association said its seasonally adjusted market index, a measure of weekly mortgage activity, fell for the week ended May 21 by 3.3 percent to 632.4 from the previous week's 654.1.\nThe data left many investors wondering about the direction of the economy. While slower economic growth helps alleviate interest-rate concerns, the question became whether there would be too much cooling.\nThe warnings of a possible terror attack in the United States had little immediate effect, but that could change, said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at Spencer Clarke L.L.C.\n\"I don't think this latest alert is priced in yet, and depending on how serious it is, it could cause a drop over the next few days, or at least keep stocks in this range,\" Sheldon said.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a ratio of 4-3 on the New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume was 1.74 billion shares, compared with 1.88 billion Tuesday.\nThe Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 2.38, or 0.4 percent, at 567.77.\nOverseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.7 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 closed up 0.5 percent, France's CAC-40 gained 1.4 percent, and Germany's DAX index rose 1 percent.\nThis article contains information from Reuters.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nCHART\n\nLoad-Date: August 25, 2005"
