    "full text": "To the Editor:\nSenator David Durenberger, in ''As Nicaraguans Prepare to Vote: Expect a Farce'' (Op-Ed, Nov. 2), states that opposition political rallies were ''harassed and broken up by Sandinista thugs.''\nI recently spent six weeks in Nicaragua, under the auspices of the New Institute of Central America, an exchange program with headquarters in Cambridge, Mass., living with a Nicaraguan family and traveling around the country.\nJames Philliou letter disputes Sen David Durenberger Nov 2 Op-Ed article predicting that Nicaraguan elections would be farceI was in Masaya on Sept. 22 and witnessed one of these publicized ''harassments.''\nDr. Arturo Cruz, the leader of the Democratic Coordinadora, whom Senator Durenberger describes as a popular political figure, arrived, unannounced, and addressed about 50 of his supporters at the headquarters of the Social Democratic Party.\nWithin minutes, several thousand Masayans gathered and began chanting anti-counterrevolutionary slogans. I had the opportunity to talk with several of the people opposing Dr. Cruz and found that they were housewives, students, artisans, teachers and shopkeepers.\nThey had one thing in common: they believed that Arturo Cruz is collaborating with the Reagan Administration's effort to destabilize and ultimately overthrow the Nicaraguan Government. Many of the ''thugs'' had brothers, fathers or sons who had been killed by the U.S.-backed counterrevolutionaries, or ''contras.''\nBecause of the protection of the Sandinista police, Dr. Cruz delivered his speech unmolested. Among the crowd, Sandinista Front activists used their loudspeaker and credibility with the people to call for restraint and discipline.\nWhat one participant called an effort to show Dr. Cruz that ''he can't manipulate our electoral process,'' was reported in La Prensa and by the U.S. media as an example of Sandinista ''terrorism.''\n \nJAMES PHILLIOU Washington, Nov. 3, 1984"
