    "full text": "Eco-terrorism is a real threat in this nation. But lumping peaceful, lawful anti-tax protesters, gay-rights activists and opponents of Marcellus shale natural gas drilling in with those dangerous lunatics is an outrage. \nYet that's what the nonprofit Institute of Terrorism Research and Response of York did in weekly bulletins to law enforcement personnel and energy companies under a no-bid $103,000 contract with the Pennsylvania Department of Homeland Security. \nExposed, the contract was terminated. But that doesn't end concerns it raised, including Gov. Ed Rendell's role. \nMr. Rendell, doing his best impersonation of Sgt. Hans Schultz, claims he didn't know about the contract until Sept. 8. But The Patriot-News of Harrisburg reports chief policy adviser Donna Cooper was among top gubernatorial staffers who knew in July that the institute was tracking protesters -- even members of Good Schools Pennsylvania, which Ms. Cooper founded. \nSomebody's not telling the truth. \nRendell's chief of staff is heading an investigation into the matter (Feel better?). Senate Republicans want all related documents. One way or another, officials who confused exercising the First Amendment with a terrorist threat must be held accountable. \n\nLoad-Date: September 19, 2010"
