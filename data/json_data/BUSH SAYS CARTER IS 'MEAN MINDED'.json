    "full text": "In one of his toughest attacks of the campaign, George Bush, the Republican candidate for Vice President, said today that President Carter was a ''small, mean-minded'' politician who would ''do anything'' to win re-election.\nMr. Bush also charged that the President had undermined Israel's security by condoning ''pro-P.L.O.'' and other anti-Israel actions that encouraged terrorism.\nAN-A\nHe specifically mentioned Andrew Young, the former United Nations delegate, who once held talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization.\nMr. Bush made his accusations in a speech to a convention of the National Newspaper Association and the Missouri Press Association. He later amplified them at a fund-raising event. Aides said he was ''fed up'' with the President's attacks on Ronald Reagan, who chose Mr. Bush as his running mate, and that Mr. Bush had decided that St.  Louis, with a significant Jewish population, was a good place to begin a counterattack.\n \n'Growing Distrust of Mr. Carter'\nCiting and paraphrasing media criticism about President Carter's aggressive, often personal campaign style, Mr. Bush said there was ''a growing distrust of Mr. Carter and his methods, both of governing and of campaigning.''\n''The American people,'' he added, ''will not abide a small, meanminded do-anything-to-win campaigner in the White House.'' As for Israel, Mr. Bush said: ''This Administration, by various devices - including the pro-P.L.O. activities of its former U.N. Ambassador, Andrew Young - has given Israel less support than any American government since the birth of the Israeli nation in 1948. Jimmy Carter has undermined the security of an ally by encouraging Israel's enemies.''\n\nGraphic\n\n \nIllustrations: photo of George Bush"
