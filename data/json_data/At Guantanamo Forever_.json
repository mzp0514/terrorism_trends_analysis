In recent years, defendants have been convicted of material support for attending terrorist training camps, attempting to provide medical aid to injured fighters and even supplying funds for the humanitarian activities of designated terrorist groups. A detainee who cannot be prosecuted under such sweeping laws is unlikely to pose a ''significant security threat.''\n  Moreover, if the government's evidence is not ''usable'' in court because of the brutal methods employed to obtain it, then surely it is not ''usable'' or reliable enough to justify long-term imprisonment without charge or trial. \n  Our existing courts have proved time and again that they are well equipped to handle terrorism cases without compromising our fundamental values.\n  Ben Wizner  New York, July 21, 2009\n  The writer is a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union's National Security Project.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: July 26, 2009"
