But you would go in search of your children at school or other family members.\nA new report by the New York Academy of Medicine concludes that the nation's terrorist-response plans don't take into account how real people in real situations really act. Thus, said the august academicians, the nation's vaunted terrorism-response plans in two likely scenarios are of little value.\n The good news is that we're not a nation of sheep. The bad news is that in the event of a bioterrorist or \"dirty\" bomb attack that Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge keeps saying is just a matter of time, government response plans are going to fall apart.\n Basically, we don't like being told what to do. Even more basically, we don't trust the government to know what's best for us.\n During the Cold War, the government built a top-secret, multimillion-dollar \"bunker\" at the famed Greenbrier Hotel in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va., where the nation's political leaders were supposed to go in case of a nuclear attack. The president, lawmakers, Cabinet members and justices were to board buses, planes and trains and leave their families behind while they holed up and ran the government. Planners even had a TV studio from where lawmakers would report to anyone still alive.\n It seems the government has not learned much.\n The 65-page \"Redefining Readiness Report\" claims that, in crisis situations, \"many Americans would not be safeguarded because existing terrorism-response plans don't account for how people would behave. … Current plans have been created in a 'top-down' style, telling people what to do in the event of an attack without considering all of the risks and concerns that drive people's actions.\"\n Researchers on the readiness project commissioned a poll of 2,545 adults selected at random, asking them what they would do in the smallpox and dirty-bomb scenarios.\n Only two-fifths of respondents said they would rush to follow directions to get the vaccination. Many said they were afraid they'd catch smallpox. Others said they have a condition -- such as eczema, pregnancy or an immune-system problem -- that could endanger them if they got vaccinated or came into contact with a recently vaccinated person. Fifty million Americans have such conditions, meaning they rightly fear the vaccine more than the risk of contracting smallpox.\n Only three-fifths would follow directions to stay where they were or go to a public shelter in the event of a dirty-bomb explosion a mile away -- even with a radioactive cloud moving in their direction. Those surveyed said they would fear being separated from loved ones or not being able to get in touch, for example, with children at school because of jammed phone lines.\n The researchers also found that citizens reluctant to follow the government's advice in a crisis would be more willing if they could get their doctor's opinion or if they had talked their response through before it actually occurred. In other words, the government's assumption that Americans just want to be told the facts and not the rationale behind them as well as all likely ramifications is false.\n The researchers found that just giving the public multiple options for what to do in a crisis seemed to calm fears. Getting the public involved in planning was suggested.\n Additionally, researchers said the government should pay attention to the findings because they are consistent with the way health-care workers responded to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Smallpox Vaccination Program -- after four months, only 8.5 percent of 440,000 workers agreed to be vaccinated.\n In June 2001, the government staged a mock smallpox bioterrorism attack. The man playing the president in the exercise, former Sen. Sam Nunn, a Georgia Democrat, warned that all the scenarios the government could devise to safeguard people would not work if Americans don't cooperate. People don't trust the government to do what's best for them, he said.\n Since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, this nation has spent billions of dollars to prepare for and deflect further terrorist attacks. Alas, the new report finds that distressingly little has been accomplished to protect real people in real-world attacks because the government didn't ask real people what they would do and think in various situations.\n It seems like common sense …\n\nNotes\n\nAnn McFeatters is National Bureau chief for the Post-Gazette and The Blade of Toledo, Ohio (amcfeatters@nationalpress.com, 1-202-662-7071).  \n\nLoad-Date: September 23, 2004"
