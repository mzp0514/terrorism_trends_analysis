Moore, the executive director of the association, said the curriculum would be modeled after one used for truck drivers.\n Mr. Moore said the training would help drivers spot unusual activity. He said it would also help them identify suspicious people at bus stops and respond to medical emergencies.\n  ''Terrorism is a part of the course, but it is not the total focus,'' he said.\n  Sandra Carpenter, spokeswomen for Durham School Services, which operates buses in Madison, Milford, Stratford and Trumbull, said the company would participate.\n  ''Our No.1 priority is safety,'' she said. ''Part of that is being sure that our drivers are watching out and identifying any security threats or incidents. And it is imperative they know how to respond to those situations.''\n  School bus drivers are already required to have six hours of training each year, Mr. Moore said. He said the new training would not be mandated. \n  ''School bus drivers drive the same route and see the same things every day,'' he said. ''This will just teach them to take a little more time to be alert.''\n  Mr. Moore said he did not know on what date the classes would start.\n    JEFF HOLTZ\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: August 7, 2005"
