But given the magnitude of the Sept. 11 attacks, he said, the nation had little choice but to update surveillance procedures \"written in the era of rotary telephones\" to better combat today's sophisticated terrorists.\n\"We may never know what horrors our country was spared by the diligent and determined work of our police forces . . . under the most trying conditions,\" Bush said. \"They deserve our full support and every means of help that we can provide.\"\nLawmakers, concerned about possible abuse of power, put an expiration date on part of the bill. Unless Congress renews the antiterrorism law before Dec. 31, 2005, the eavesdropping sections expire.\nUnder the law, the FBI has expanded wiretapping and electronic surveillance authority. It allows nationwide jurisdiction for search warrants and electronic surveillance devices, including legal expansion of those devices to e-mail and the Internet. Agents can, for example, use roving wiretaps to monitor any telephone used by a terrorism suspect, rather than getting separate authorizations for each phone that person uses.\nThe law sets strong penalties for those who harbor or finance terrorists and establishes new punishments for possessing biological weapons. It makes it a federal crime to commit an act of terrorism against a mass-transit system. It increases the overall number of crimes considered terrorist acts and toughens the punishment for committing them. Also, police would have greater ability to secretly search people's homes and business records and to listen in on conversations over the telephone or via computers.\nNew Antiterrorism Provisions\nHighlights of the bill signed into law yesterday:\n* Increases penalties for committing terrorism.\n* Increases penalties for harboring or funding terrorists or terrorist organizations.\n* Makes terrorism a reason for federal officials to obtain a wiretapping order.\n* Lets federal officials obtain a wiretapping order that would follow a suspect to any phone the person uses.\n* Lets federal officials obtain nationwide search warrants for terrorism probes, including e-mail and physical searches.\n* Lets the attorney general detain foreigners suspected of terrorism. The attorney general then must start deportation proceedings, during which the foreigner must stay in federal custody, or charge the person with a crime. If neither is done within seven days, the foreigner must be released.\n* Enhances data-sharing among the FBI, State Department, Immigration and Naturalization Service, and foreign governments in terrorism investigations.\n* Makes committing an act of terrorism against a mass transit system a federal crime.\n* Makes illegal the possession of substances that can be used as biological or chemical weapons for any purpose besides a \"peaceful\" one.\n* Includes legislation that would fight international money laundering in an effort to thwart the financing of terrorism and protect the U.S. banking system from illicit money.\n* Authorizes the president to restrict exports of agricultural products, medicine or medical devices to Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia and areas it controls.\n* Authorizes nationwide search warrants for computer information in terrorism probes, including billing records.\n* Adds more federal agents to the northern U.S. border.\n* Adds a Dec. 31, 2005, expiration date for new wiretapping and surveillance powers.\n* Lets people sue if the government leaks information gained through the new wiretapping and surveillance powers.\n* Lets federal officials seize voice-mail records if a judge issues a warrant.\n* Bars U.S. entry to prospective immigrants involved in money-laundering crimes.\n* Includes $36.8 million to put in place before the end of the year a database program to track the 600,000 foreign students at U.S. colleges.\n* Requires the FBI to allow a judge to monitor its use of its Carnivore e-mail tracking system.\nSource: Associated Press\n\nNotes\n\nAt War With Terror\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO;\nKATHY WILLENS, Associated Press\nAfter a memorial service for New York City firefighter Christian Regenhard, his mother, Sally Regenhard, sister Christina and father, Al, leave St. Patrick's Cathedral yesterday.
