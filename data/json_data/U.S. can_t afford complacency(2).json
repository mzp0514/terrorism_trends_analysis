We have learned to accept taking off our shoes and putting small containers of toiletries in plastic bags while going through airport security. \nWe have heeded the call to live our lives normally, to continue to travel, etc. \nBut we also must heed the call to remain vigilant, to report suspicious activity and recognize the need for enhanced security measures, despite the inconvenience. \nAs national security adviser Stephen Hadley reminds us, \"the struggle against terrorism is going to be with us for a long time.\" \n\nLoad-Date: July 17, 2007"
