    "full text": "Though the Bush Administration hasn't dusted off the Sedition Act of 1798, which made speaking against the government a crime, Nancy Chang believes it is getting close.\nChang was the guest speaker at the Utah chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union's Bill of Rights Celebration held Friday night at the Salt Lake City Public Library.\nShe is the senior litigation attorney for the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York City.\nHer recent book, Silencing Political Dissent, explores the ways in which post-Sept. 11 anti-terrorism measures such as the Patriot Act threaten basic American civil liberties.\nChang spoke along similar lines Friday, explaining how the 342-page Patriot Act represents Congress' \"abdication of its responsibility to seek alternate methods to make us secure without jeopardizing our freedoms.\"\nPost Sept. 11 anti-terrorism measures, Chang said, have given the Executive Branch of the U.S. government far more power than it used to have.\n\"They have turned the presumption of innocence on its head,\" she said pointing to how few of the thousands of Muslim men arrested for terrorism suspicions were ever charged.\nAnd the withholding of information, she said, shows a disrespect for the public.\n\"We lose the war [on terrorism] without firing a shot,\" Chang said.\nChang urged Utah ACLU members to fight these measures legally and politically.\nACLU Utah Executive Director Dani Eyer liked Chang's work because she challenged the Patriot Act before most did.\nEyer said the organization chose to hold the event in the library this year, partly to recognize librarians' roles in standing up for civil liberties.\nACLU Utah also honored Salt Lake City's Multi-Cultural Legal Center, which fought Utah's \"English-Only\" law with the ACLU.\n\nLoad-Date: May 10, 2003"
