    "full text": "On his way to the Middle East, Vice President Dick Cheney heard strong support Monday from British Prime Minister Tony Blair for widening the U.S.-led war on terrorism to keep weapons of mass destruction out of hostile hands.\nBoth Blair and Cheney signaled a tough stand against Iraq and such weapons, but they were short on specifics.\nAt a joint news conference, Blair said no final decisions had been made on the war's next phase, and Cheney offered no timetable.\nIn fact, Cheney said he was \"not announcing decisions\" during his visit to nine Arab countries, Turkey and Israel. His first stop is Jordan on Tuesday.\n\"I'll be there to conduct frank discussions and to solicit the views of important friends and allies,\" Cheney said.\nBoth the vice president and Blair hinted that military action against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was on the table.\n\"There's a lot of evidence that he does, in fact, have and is continuing to develop weapons of mass destruction,\" Cheney said.\n\"The threat,\" Blair said, \"will have to be addressed.\"\nCheney did deliver a specific plan for military action to remove Hussein, said National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice in an interview on PBS' \"NewsHour with Jim Lehrer.\"\n\"The vice president will talk to our friends in the region about what we might do, but he is not carrying a decision by the president of the United States to use force against Iraq,\" Rice said. \"That simply isn't the case.\"\nBritain has been a strong American ally in the anti-terrorism campaign.\nAs well as building a case for a tougher policy against Iraq, Cheney is to talk to Middle Eastern leaders about spiraling Israeli-Palestinian violence.\n\nLoad-Date: March 16, 2002"
