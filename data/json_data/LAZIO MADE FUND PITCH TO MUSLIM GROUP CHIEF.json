    "full text": "Rick Lazio sent a fund-raising letter to an official of the same Muslim group whose members he blasted as supporters of Mideast terrorism after he learned the organization raised $50,000 for Hillary Rodham Clinton, it was reported yesterday.\nThe letter to Dr. Faroque Khan, chairman of the New York chapter of the American Muslim Alliance, bore Lazio's computer-generated signature and was dated Oct. 23 - two days before Lazio accused Clinton of accepting \"blood money\" for her campaign, The New York Observer said.\nClinton returned the money - along with a $1,000 contribution from another Muslim group - after it became an issue. Lazio shrugged off the report of his own fund-raising appeal yesterday by saying: \"We have sent out 18 million pieces of mail, and some of them were sent to the wrong people. But as far as I know and understand, we have not received a dime from any person who supports terrorism as a legitimate political tool.\"\nHe called the letter to Khan \"a nonevent\" and laughingly pointed out that former White House spokesman Joe Lockhart even got one of his mass mailing solicitations at one point during the campaign.\nThe letter was addressed to Khan personally and did not mention the American Muslim Alliance.\nAshy Saved, president of the California-based Alliance, has been accused of supporting Palestinian terrorism against Israel but claims his remarks have been taken out of context. Alliance officials have described the group as mainstream.\n\nLoad-Date: November 2, 2000"
