    "full text": "A man charged with terrorizing his former boss for three years entered a plea of not guilty in Dubuque District Court this morning.\nRalph Weinbender, 43, 978 Spires Drive, was formally charged with terrorism and fourth-degree criminal mischief at his arraignment before District Judge Robert Curnan.\nWeinbender remains free on bond. He posted a $10,000 cash bond Jan. 8 hours after his initial appearance in Dubuque Associate District Court.\nThe charges against him say Weinbender emptied six rounds from a .22- caliber gun into a home on Clarke Crest Drive where Steven Ressler and his family were sleeping in 1992.\nNo one was injured but several bullets were lodged in the wall of the bedroom where Ressler's children were sleeping, court documents say.\nRessler was Weinbender's supervisor at John Deere Dubuque Works and participated in Weinbender's dismissal, police said.\nPolice said Ressler videotaped someone firing a BB gun at his home in 1993. Police suspected Weinbender was the man whose face was obscured on the tape. They got the missing clues when Weinbender's marriage unraveled last year.\nA few days after receiving a divorce settlement in September, court documents say, Debra Weinbender found her estranged husband waiting for her beside her car.\n\"You just don't know what is going to happen,\" Weinbender allegedly told her. \"I will kill a member of your family.\"\nWeinbender pleaded not guilty to charges of first and second-degree harassment in that incident. A judge ordered him to have no contact with his wife while the charges against him are pending.\nIn 1995, police were able to positively link Weinbender to the BB gun shooting at Ressler's home when Debra Weinbender identified her husband as the man in the 1993 videotape.\nThey obtained a warrant to search Weinbender's home. Police found a Ruger . 22 caliber semi-automatic handgun hidden under a stairwell.\nBallistics tests matched the gun to the bullets found in Ressler's home.\n\nLoad-Date: December 9, 1996"
