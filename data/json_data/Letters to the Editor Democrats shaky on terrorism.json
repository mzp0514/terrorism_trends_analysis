    "full text": "1941 Spy Glass Drive\nYou wish for what?\nThe Free World is refusing to seriously deal with radical Islamism. Had a Democrat been elected president the past two terms, we'd still have Syria, North Korea and Iran seeking nuclear weapons and we'd still have Israel at war with Hezbollah (Syria).\nIf not fighting terrorism in Iraq, we should be fighting it elsewhere. No matter where, insurgents will rally. It's a global war on terrorism. Get it? Terrorists do not want peace, in fact the opposite. But, it's easier to not defend our way of life.\nAfter all, we never responded to the previous dozen attacks. Syrian President Ahmadinejad stated, \"Americans have no stomach for fighting\" and \"America can be destroyed by militants controlling the world's oil.\" He also told his fellow Muslims to \"prepare to rule the world.\" Scary.\nLiberals like Michael Moore, George Soros, John Kerry, Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi (those running the Democratic Party) want us to cut and run. Sen. Schumer has proposed we tap our oil reserves. Smart?\nOur military weaponry does not run on air, should we be attacked? Any thing for political gain. The liberals also were critical of the president's use of NSA phone line surveillance and financial tracking, the same techniques the British used last week to prevent nine jets carrying liquid explosives from departing London targeted for the U.S. Be careful what you wish for and how you vote.\n\nLoad-Date: August 25, 2006"
