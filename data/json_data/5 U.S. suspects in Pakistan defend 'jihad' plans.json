    "full text": "SARGODHA, Pakistan - Five Americans detained in Pakistan told a court Monday they intended to cross the border into Afghanistan to wage jihad against Western forces but denied any links to al-Qaida or plans to carry out terrorist attacks in Pakistan.\nThe admission could be a prelude to possible U.S. conspiracy charges but might also draw sympathy from an increasingly anti-American Pakistani public. Such feelings have complicated U.S. efforts to persuade Pakistan to do more to crack down on militants carrying out cross-border attacks on coalition troops in Afghanistan.\n\"We are not terrorists,\" one of the five men, Ramy Zamzam, told The Associated Press as he entered the courtroom in the eastern Pakistani city of Sargodha, where they were arrested in December.\n\"We are jihadists, and jihad is not terrorism,\" said Zamzam, a 22-year-old Egyptian American who was a dental student at Howard University in Washington, D.C.\nJihad has several different meanings in Islam, but Zamzam seemed to be referring to the duty to fight against foreign forces viewed as occupying a Muslim country.\nZamzam and another member of the group, Ethiopian American Ahmed Minni, insisted the men had no links with al-Qaida and were focused only on Afghanistan, according to court documents.\n\"They said that they only intended to travel to Afghanistan to help their Muslim brothers who are in trouble, who are bleeding and who are being victimized by Western forces,\" said the group's lawyer, Ameer Abdullah Rokhri.\nIt was the first time the men, ages 19 to 25 and all from the Washington area, have addressed a court since their arrest. They arrived wearing a mix of Western clothes, such as jeans and tracksuits, and traditional shalwar kameez robes. They were handcuffed as they entered and exited the hearing, which was closed to media.\nPakistani police have not filed formal charges but say they plan to seek life sentences under the country's anti-terrorism law.\n\"We have told the court that police have completed their investigation and have enough evidence against the five suspects to try them under anti-terrorism law,\" said police officer Matiullah Shahani.\nThe court remanded the men to prison for 14 days Monday to give police time to prepare the case.\nFBI agents have questioned some of the men and are working to see if there is enough evidence to charge any of them with conspiracy to provide material support to a terrorist organization, officials have said.\n\nLoad-Date: January 5, 2010"
