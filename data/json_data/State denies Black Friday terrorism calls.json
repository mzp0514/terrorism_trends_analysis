Bill Haslam has asked that Tennessee be allowed to refuse Syrian refugees as a result of the attacks.\nIn a statement released Monday, Gov. Haslam said \"As we mourn the loss of innocent life from Friday's horrific and cowardly attacks in Paris, these terrible events have once again shown us that the threat of Islamic terrorism knows no boundaries and recognizes no borders. We as a state must do everything we can to provide Tennesseans the safe environment to live, work and raise a family that so many across the world seek.\"\n\"This that happened in Paris has had an awakening for a lot of people of how serious this is. They have named the United States as a target. They are looking for soft targets which makes it more dangerous for everybody,\" Rep. Mark Pody said.\n___ (c)2015 The Lebanon Democrat, Tenn.
