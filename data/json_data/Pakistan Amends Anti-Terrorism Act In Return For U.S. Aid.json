    "full text": "(RTTNews) - Pakistan has amended presidential ordinances of the Anti-Terrorism Act, raising the period for keeping terror suspects in custody for interrogation to 90 days.\nPresident Asif Ali Zardari made the amendment with immediate effect, media reports say.\nCurrently, the duration of remand is restricted to 30 days. As per the amendment, those providing logistic and financial support and directly or indirectly involved in any terrorist activity would be treated as terrorists. They would be punished under provisions applicable to terrorists who execute terrorist activities.\nThe amended ordinance says that those providing information about the targets, their residence and transport, would also be considered as terrorists - a provision that could discourage civilians from helping the security forces in anti-terrorist operations.\nBail conditions to release suspects, arrested on the charges of terrorism, have been further tightened.\nCorrespondents say that the amendment is one of the conditions agreed by Pakistan in a recent bill passed by the US Congress, which triples non-military aid to Pakistan.\nThe Kerry-Lugar bill provides an annual outlay of $1.5bn for five years.\nUnder the bill, the US will certify that Pakistan is working to dismantle its nuclear proliferation networks.\nAccording to local media, Islamabad was required to strengthen its counter-terrorism and anti-money laundering laws.\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\nCopyright(c) 2009 RTTNews.com, Inc.
