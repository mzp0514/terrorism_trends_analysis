    "full text": "The first television commercials promoting President Bush's re-election campaign rolled out last week, and they immediately generated controversy.\nThe commercials include images from Sept. 11, 2001, a date that changed U.S. history and American life forever.\nThe terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, as well as the hijacked jet's crash in Pennsylvania, are events and images burnished in our national psyche.\nThe Bush administration's response to those events- and, to a lesser degree, prior to them - and its performance in the nearly 21/2 years since then are legitimate issues in the presidential campaign. The outcome of the election might well hinge on voters' assessment of Bush's performance and leadership on those issues, including the war in Iraq.\nSome relatives of 9/11 victims, as well as a firefighters union, have objected to the Bush campaign showing images from that tragic day in the commercials. They consider it opportunistic. (The union complaining the most has already endorsed the president's probable opponent, Sen. John Kerry.)\nWhile some people - the victims and their families - suffered a greater loss than others, the events of that day are a shared national tragedy.\nIndeed, some relatives of 9/11 victims applauded Bush's commercials. One, Debra Burlingame, said, \"These images honor those whose lives were lost.\"\nIt should not be up to a few people to decide what the president may and may not show the American people. It will be up to the American voter to decide that.\nEditorials reflect the consensus of the Telegraph Herald Editorial Board: Brian Cooper (chairman), Ken Brown, Libby Burkhart, Monty Gilles, Amy Gilligan and Jim Normandin.\n\nLoad-Date: March 7, 2004"
