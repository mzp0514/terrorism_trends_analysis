Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said Clinton won't\nget all the \"controversial provisions\" he wants.\nAnd Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he doubted\nCongress would act this week, as Clinton has asked.\nOne of the issues of contention: Some lawmakers say expanded wire-tapping\nauthority could lead to invasions of privacy by the government.\nAs lawmakers in Washington locked horns, representatives from\nthe United States and other nations were planning an international\nresponse.\nIn Paris, leaders of eight nations vowed cooperative action against\nterrorism.\nBritain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the\nUnited States agreed to police the Internet, set global standards\nfor detecting bombs and tighter border checks.\nCalling terrorism an attempt to undermine civility, Attorney General\nJanet Reno said, \"Today we have stood together, resolute in our\ndetermination not to let this happen.\"\n\nLoad-Date: July 31, 1996"
