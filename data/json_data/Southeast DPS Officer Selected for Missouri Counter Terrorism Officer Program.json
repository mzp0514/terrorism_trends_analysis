The goal of the Missouri Counter Terrorism Officer Program is to develop a group of law enforcement officers throughout the state that have received an advanced level of training in counterterrorism preparedness/response, large scale emergency preparedness, and intelligence gathering and sharing.  As recognized leaders with their respective agencies, training participants will then be able to bring this training back to their departments and share it with them.\n\nLoad-Date: April 7, 2020"
