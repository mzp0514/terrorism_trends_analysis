In Catawba County, Startt pleaded guilty to 71 counts of making false bomb reports, one count of making a false bomb report to a public building and 72 counts of terrorism.\nLenoir Police Chief Scott Brown said in court that in Lenoir alone, Startt made 64 calls over six days and \"just caused a lot of panic and tension throughout the community.\"\nStartt made calls to multiple businesses, including Fatz Cafe, Dollar General and Walmart.\n\"Just from the comfort of his armchair, wherever he was, he caused a lot of panic throughout the entire 25th judicial district,\" Brown said.\nStartt was arrested July 6 in West Virginia, and last month he pleaded guilty in Burke Superior Court to 253 counts of terrorism, 251 counts of making false bomb reports, and two counts of making a false bomb report to a public building. He was sentenced at that time to 11 to 21 years in prison.\nJudge W. Todd Pomeroy said in Caldwell Superior Court that Startt's sentence in the Caldwell and Catawba charges will be served at the same time as his sentence in the Burke charges.\n___ (c)2017 the News-Topic (Lenoir, N.C.)
