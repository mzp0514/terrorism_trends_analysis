    "full text": "WASHINGTON -- The State Department will include criticism of two\nkey groups in Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization\nin its annual terrorism report due out next week, U.S. officials\nsaid Wednesday. The report will mark the first time that mainstream\nelements of the PLO are cited in the influential document.\nThe report will include Israeli accusations that the largest faction\nin the organization, Fatah, and its Tanzim youth militia took\npart in terrorist activities against Israel during the Palestinian\nuprising that began in September. The political violence in Israel\nand the West Bank and Gaza Strip has claimed the lives of nearly\n500 people.\nOfficials said the report won't address the question of whether\nArafat or other top Palestinians ordered attacks against Israeli\ntargets. However, by merely mentioning the groups, the Bush administration\nwill be taking into account congressional criticism of the PLO\nand warning Arafat to rein in his followers. \"This lays the intellectual\ngroundwork for declaring these groups foreign terrorist organizations,\"\nsaid Kenneth Katzman, a Middle East expert at the Congressional\nResearch Service. \"It puts Arafat on notice.\"\nThe PLO has had an office in Washington since its peace treaty\nwith Israel in 1993.\nA letter to President Bush earlier this month, signed by 296 members\nof Congress, called for a reassessment of the U.S.-PLO relationship\nincluding an examination of whether PLO-affiliated groups should\nbe designated as foreign terrorist organizations.\nThe officials said the report next week will not say the groups\nare \"foreign terrorist organizations,\" a classification created\nby Congress in 1996 that could oblige the United States to sever\nties with the PLO and could complicate efforts to restart peace\nnegotiations.\nThe Bush administration also has criticized Israel for \"excessive\"\nretaliation against the Palestinians, but Israel has not been\nsingled out for terrorism.\nHassan Abdel Rahman, the PLO ambassador in Washington, called\nthe criticism \"unfair, unbalanced and counterproductive.\"\nPaul Pillar, former deputy counterterrorism chief at the CIA,\nsays \"a mention of concern is probably the right thing to do.\nIt gets away from the legal requirements, but calls a spade a\nspade.\"\n\nLoad-Date: April 26, 2001"
