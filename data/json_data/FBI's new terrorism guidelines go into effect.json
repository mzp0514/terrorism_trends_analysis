    "full text": "WASHINGTON -- From Albany, N.Y., to Albuquerque, N.M., FBI field offices are working under new guidelines for terrorism cases that allow criminal and intelligence agents to work together and share information.\nThe strategy, which has been in the works for about a year, was completed over the summer, and a directive was sent to the agency's field offices in October that \"emphasized this is the way we're doing business for the future,\" a senior law enforcement official said Saturday.\n\"You can have investigators working side-by-side now, whereas before they couldn't share information and it really frustrated putting the big picture together,\" the official said.\nThe FBI also will be able to conduct more surveillance under the auspices of a secret intelligence tribunal, the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which comprises judges selected by the chief justice of the Supreme Court. The judges sit on a rotating basis to review applications for electronic surveillance.\nThe changes amount to substantial shifts for the agency, which prior to the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks was bound by a legal wall separating intelligence and criminal investigations that prevented agents from discussing information they gathered separately.\n\"The problem is that the government has very broad powers in foreign intelligence investigations that don't comply with the Fourth Amendment's usual requirements,\" said Ann Beeson, associate legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union. The Constitution's Fourth Amendment protects people from unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nLoad-Date: December 15, 2003"
