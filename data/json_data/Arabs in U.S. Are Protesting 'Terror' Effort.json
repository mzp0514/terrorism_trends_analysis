    "full text": "Leaders of Arab-American organizations are protesting new efforts by the Clinton Administration to stop the flow of money to groups suspected of terrorism, saying they will hurt Arab-American charities and undermine efforts to get them to help Palestinian economic development.\n\"If there is an individual or group contributing to terrorism, we have no problem with the Government going after that behavior,\" said Khalil Jahshan, executive director of the National Association of Arab-Americans. \"But we're worried that this effort will have a chilling effect on all Arab-American philanthropic efforts. And it will hurt the U.S. policy aimed at getting us to help Palestinians.\"\nWhile denouncing terrorism, the Arab-American leaders said the Administration campaign was mostly a public relations effort that would do little to combat terrorism but a lot to frighten Arab-Americans.\nThe Administration's new efforts include banning financial transfers to a dozen organizations suspected of terrorism, including Hamas and Islamic Holy War. The Administration has drafted legislation that would let investigators examine financial records of charities suspected of supporting terrorist groups, make it easier to wiretap suspected terrorists and set up tough procedures for deporting such suspects.\nJames Zogby, executive director of the Arab-American Institute, said, \"I worry that if the net is cast too broadly it can lead to a lot of harassment and intimidation like we've experienced in the past.\"\nJustice Department officials insist that they will safeguard civil liberties and that their aim is to stop financial aid to terrorists, which they say comes from a small number of Arab-Americans.\nArab-American leaders estimate that there are 2.5 million Arab-Americans, 150,000 of them Palestinian. They say that in most years Arab-Americans contribute less than $5 million to Palestinian causes.\nSuhail Miari, executive director of United Holy Land Fund in Chicago, a leading Arab-American charity, said many supporters are suddenly wary of giving money because they worry that they will be investigated.\n\nLoad-Date: February 9, 1995"
