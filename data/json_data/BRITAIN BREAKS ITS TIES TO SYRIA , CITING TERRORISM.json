    "full text": "LARGELY out of concern for the safety of hostages thought to be in Syrian-controlled eastern Lebanon, most Western countries have been reluctant to accuse Syria of sponsoring terrorists. That judgment shifted last week after a jury in London convicted a Jordanian of hiding a bomb in the hand luggage of his pregnant Irish lover as she prepared to board an Israeli airliner at Heathrow.\nBritain, saying it had ''conclusive evidence'' that Syrian diplomats and intelligence agents were involved in the bombing attempt, broke relations with Damascus. The United States and Canada, going part way in support, withdrew their ambassadors. Other West European countries were expected to follow suit. ''A state that encourages and takes part in terrorism isolates itself from the civilized world,'' the White House said.\nBritain's Foreign Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, said the Jordanian, Nezar Hindawi, had had a Syrian official passport and fled to the Syrian Embassy after Israeli security guards uncovered the bomb. Sir Geoffrey said ''independent evidence'' had implicated the Syrian Ambassador to London ''in securing for Hindawi the sponsorship of the Syrian intelligence authorities.'' The Ambassador, Loutof Allah Haydar, said that was ''nonsense.'' He insisted the affair was ''staged'' to embarrass Syria by ''the Americans and Israeli intelligence.'' Tass, the Soviet press agency echoed those charges. Syria shut down the British missions in Damascus and barred British planes and ships from Syrian airspace and waters.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPhoto of the Syrian Ambassador, Loutof Allah Haydar outside his embassy in London (AP)"
