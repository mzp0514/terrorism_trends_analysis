Gates said Sept. 11 was far from the first terrorist attack on America, and despite wide sharing of information among major intelligence agencies around the world, no one anticipated Sept. 11.\n\"My remarks will be as subtle and ambivalent as you would expect,\" said Gates, as he introduced his speech at the Counterintelligence Conference at the Annenberg Presidential Conference Center Friday night.\nThe comment was met by hearty laughter from the crowd, but Gates' defense of U.S. intelligence agencies was far from subtle or ambivalent.\nGates addressed a series of difficulties that hampered the information gathering abilities of the intelligence agencies. One of the biggest problems Gates identified was the lack of resources of these agencies. He said the CIA did not receive a real budget increase from the time of the Reagan administration in 1986 until 2002 -- after the attack took place.\nGates said much of the intelligence efforts have been devoted to monitoring Soviet activities in recent history, and the agencies lack the experience and linguistic skills to deal with the new challenge of terrorism.\n\"Intelligence is a professional experience, and acquiring it will obviously require time,\" he said.\nGates said whereas intelligence often served an auxiliary role in the Cold War, it is of primary importance in the War on Terrorism, which is inherently a more difficult job.\n\"It is also true that the role of intelligence has changed since the Cold War, and so has its target,\" Gates said. \"Penetrating small terrorist cells where everyone is related and everyone is potentially a murderer is difficult.\"\nGates said in recent times, leaders have come to expect too much from intelligence agencies. He divided all information obtained by leaders into two categories: secrets and mysteries. Secrets may be acquired or learned, but mysteries are usually \"unknowable until the last moment.\" \"The money buys you no crystal ball, and only a small window into the human psyche,\" Gates said.\nTexas A&M President Robert M.
