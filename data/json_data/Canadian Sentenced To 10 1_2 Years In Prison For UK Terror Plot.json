He has already spent nearly five years in prison since his arrest.\nProsecutors had argued that Khawaja had collaborated with five others in a foiled 2004 plan to attack a London nightclub, a shopping center and electrical and gas facilities. His five co-conspirators were sentenced to life in prison in April 2007 for their involvement in the bomb plot.\nKhawaja is the first person to be sentenced under Canada&apos;s Anti-Terrorism Act, which was enacted in 2001 after the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States. He pleaded not guilty to the charges and was tried without a jury.\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\nCopyright(c) 2009 RTTNews.com, Inc.
