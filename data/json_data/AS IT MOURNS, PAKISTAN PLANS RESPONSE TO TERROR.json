But Tuesday's attack has shaken people to their core. There is now a palpable resolve on the part of people and the government to confront this menace head on.\nIn a high-level meeting in Peshawar chaired by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and attended by representatives of all political parties and the army chief, it was decided to lift the temporary hold on executions of terrorists being held in Pakistani jails. Thousands of Taliban are jailed under death sentences that, because of pleas by the European Union, have not been carried out. In the past five years, there have been many jailbreaks where large numbers of convicted killers have escaped.\nIn the meantime, the toll from Tuesday's attack rose to 144. Close to 100 students are unaccounted for, according to some sources.\nPeshawar's 1,500-bed Lady Reading Hospital, the largest public hospital in Khyber Pukhtunkhwa province, received about 50 injured students.\nZulfiqar Ahmad, a math teacher being treated in the trauma intensive care unit there, said he was in a classroom administering a test to 18 12th-graders when he heard the echoes of gunfire down the corridor. As the gunfire approached, he bolted the door and waited; two terrorists kicked the door open and started shooting.\nHe was hit in the arm and leg and fell to the floor. Soon, he felt the weight of others - some dead, others dying - piling on him.\nHe was rescued within an hour by army commandos, but none of his students survived.\nBecause the firing was random and indiscriminate, the spectrum of injuries was wide. Gunshot wounds to the chest, face, abdomen, and extremities were common.\nIn another hospital room was a ninth-grader who has a bullet wound to the chest but is expected to make a full recovery.\nHe was in the large hall of the school, he said, where he and many other students were receiving instructions in first aid when three terrorists barged in and started shooting. He was shot, and the impact threw him to the floor with other students falling on him.\nA young mother wrapped in a shawl was silently weeping by the bedside of her son in another ward. The student was hit in the jaw and had undergone surgery, but he was doing well enough to be disconnected from a respirator.\nA reporter gently tapped the youngster's shoulder and asked him to open his eyes. He complied, and when he saw his mother, he smiled in a beautiful reunion.\nAccounts of the attack vary. What is certain is that nine men entered the school from the rear of the compound by climbing a wall that separated it from a cemetery.\nThey split up and entered classrooms in random fashion.\nAs the army commandos continued to force the terrorists into a corner, bodies were removed and the injured were evacuated from already cleared areas.\nThe terrorists, however, did not give up without a fight. They not only used automatic rifles to kill, they used hand grenades and planted improvised explosive devices. They also used knives to slaughter and in few instances poured gasoline on the bodies and set them on fire.\nAmong the chaos were acts of heroism by students and teachers alike. Some senior students evacuated younger children to safety outside the building. There were instances of students guarding female teachers, only to lose their own lives.\nIn Peshawar on Wednesday, streets that are usually full of traffic were deserted and empty. People lingered around street corners talking about the tragedy. As is their wont, politicians from across the country made a beeline to hospitals to visit the survivors. According to skeptics, it was a godsend photo-op for them.\nConsensus is emerging among politicians and the army that it should not be business as usual when the shock of the tragedy has passed. Political parties generally agree that the military should conduct an intense ground attack and air attacks on Taliban sanctuaries in Waziristan. Fear of backlash against the government if nothing concrete is done is now driving the response.\nPakistan has asked Afghanistan to extradite Taliban leaders who have committed acts of terrorism in Pakistan.\nObservers are speculating how Pakistani religious parties would act in the face of a national consensus against the Taliban.\nThese parties traditionally have been fence sitters when it comes to terrorism. Some of them have ties with factions of the Taliban movement. If these parties remain noncommittal to a hard line against the Taliban, a backlash by the public could emerge.\nWhile the identities of the terrorists are known to military authorities, they have not been made public. In photographs that are being circulated, they appear to be from central Asia. Many times previously, captured terrorists were found to be from the Central Asian Republics as well as from Chechnya.\n\nNotes\n\nS.
