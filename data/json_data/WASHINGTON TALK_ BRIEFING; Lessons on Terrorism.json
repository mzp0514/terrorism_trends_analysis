    "full text": "The degree of success individual European nations have had in fighting terrorism has been recognized for some time by their leaders as having serious economic and political consequences in the United States, and they are beginning to send emissaries to Washington to explain to the American public, rather than merely the State Department, how they have succeeded and the problems posed by their failures.\nToday the French Minister of Tourism, Jean-Jacques Descamps, will hold a news conference at the Grand Hotel to discuss the new French requirement that tourists have visas and to outline some other antiterrorist moves that Prime Minister Jacques Chirac is scheduled to announce Wednesday in a United Nations speech. Mr. Descamps will also report on a poll on American attitudes toward the French and travel in their country, taken before the recent wave of terrorist bombings in Paris.\nOn Oct. 17, the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs will have officials available at a Washington seminar about terrorism in their country. The ministry says Italy has foiled eight terrorist attacks in the last 12 months, and its representatives will explain their security techniques at the seminar, to be held at the Washington Hilton by the National Italian American Foundation."
