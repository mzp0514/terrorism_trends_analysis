Greece is expected to receive approval to join the EU's single currency group later this month in Portugal.\n\"Greece is unable to face the phenomenon of terrorism,\" complained parliament member Dora Bakoyannis, whose politician husband, Pavlos, was killed by the November 17 group in 1989. \"We must not have taboos to take the steps needed.\"\nSuch demands also are coming from Washington. Among the November 17 victims are four American officials and one U.S. Embassy employee.\nA report last week by a congressional commission proposed sanctions on Greece and Pakistan for \"not cooperating fully\" in the battle against terrorism. Hearings are scheduled next week. The State Department has described Greece as \"one of the weakest links\" in anti-terrorism efforts in Europe.\nThe spotlight also is on Greece to develop a security plan for the 2004 Olympics. Saunders, 52, was shot near the main stadium for the games.\n\nLoad-Date: June 10, 2000"
