None was a bomb.\n\"All of them have been checked,\" Menuhin said, adding that in some cases robots were used to remove suspicious objects.\n \n\"The police are taking every threat seriously,\" she said.\nSunday is the first day of the workweek here, and Israelis appeared to be out in the usual numbers.\nMore than the usual number of heavily armed police and soldiers were on street corners, occasionally demanding identification from passers-by. Although the U.S. Embassy warned Americans to stay out of crowded places, tourists also gathered in the usual downtown areas.\n\"It's important to not let it change your behavior. That's giving in to what (the bombers) are trying to accomplish,\" said Morty Schaja, 42, an investment manager who came with his family from New York.\n\"The presence of Israeli soldiers has made me feel better,\" said Michael Klieger, 43, a postal supervisor visiting with his family from Pembroke Pines, Fla.  Funerals were held Sunday for the last two victims of the twin suicide bombings in the Mahane Yehuda vegetable market Wednesday ---including one whose funeral was postponed because his mother was not Jewish and therefore had to be buried in a cemetery for people of mixed religious backgrounds.\nThe explosions killed 15 people, including the bombers, and injured more than 150 others. About 40 were still in hospitals Sunday.\nIn addition to reminding Israelis of a wave of terrorist attacks last year that killed 57 people, the bombing derailed new attempts to begin p peace talks over the fate of the occupied territories.\nU.S. special envoy Dennis Ross is expected to visit the region this week in order to restore the security links that Israel and the Palestinians have used to curtail terrorism.\nAs tension between the two sides remained high, Israelis have closed off travel between most Palestinian cities, calling it a necessary move while they investigate the bombing.\nAccording to Israeli media, the Israeli army arrested at least 116 Palestinians in search of clues to the bombing. Security forces have not ruled out that the bombers could have come from abroad.\nA leaflet distributed after the bombing demanded that Israel release Palestinian prisoners by 9 p.m. Sunday ---a deadline that apparently passed without incident. Security officials question the authenticity of the leaflet.\nPalestinians complained Sunday about the Israeli military clampdown in the West Bank and Gaza territories that they have occupied since the 1967 war.\n\"The situation here is very difficult. The people here are divided into two groups ---those who support the bombing and those who reject it,\" said Elham Khatib, 23, a Jerusalem political activist with Fateh, the m majority Palestinian party.\nShe said she had not been able to go to her classes at nearby Bethlehem University because of the closure.\n\"How do you suppose I can support the peace process when I can't even get to my university 10 minutes from here?\" Khatib said.\nSome merchants in Arab sections of East Jerusalem received leaflets encouraging Palestinians to attack Israeli soldiers and telling merchants to close their shops one day a month.\nThose were the kinds of actions taken in the Intifada uprising, which helped prompt Israel to begin returning land to Palestinians.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nIsraeli soldiers pass a soft-drink seller near the Damascus Gate on Sunday\n in Jerusalem. / RICK BOWMER / Associated Press\n Chart: UPDATE ON THE MIDDLE EAST\n National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said Sunday that there is no\n evidence so far of a connection between the two men suspected of plotting\n to bomb a Brooklyn subway and Middle Eastern terror groups.\n The FBI, New York police and international intelligence agencies were c\n conducting \"a very intensive investigation,\" but \"have not established any\n direct relationship,\" Berger said on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n Gazi Ibrahim Abu Mezer, 23, and Lafi Khalil, 22, were captured during an\n early morning raid on their Brooklyn apartment Thursday. Authorities said\n they were hours away from pulling off a suicide bombing at a busy subway\n station.\n Both men were shot and wounded when police say they tried to detonate one\n of the devices. Their injuries were not considered life-threatening.\n Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat grappled Sunday with a new\n crisis ---how to meet his payroll after Israel made good on a threat to\n withhold millions of dollars from his government in the wake of last\n week's devastating market bombings.\n The action, one of several punitive measures Israel announced after W\n Wednesday's attack, left the Palestinian Authority unable to meet its $ 40\n million payroll, now overdue to about 80,000 Palestinian police officers\n and civil servants. On Friday, Israel withheld $ 25 million in tax revenues\n it owed the authority.\n \"The Palestinian Authority was barely making it even before this,\" said S\n Salam Fayyad, the International Monetary Fund's representative in the Gaza\n Strip and West Bank. \"I don't see how this can be sustained.\"\n\nLoad-Date: August 5, 1997"
