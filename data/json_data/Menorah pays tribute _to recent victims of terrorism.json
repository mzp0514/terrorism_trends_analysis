    "full text": "CLEARWATER - Rabbi Levi Hodakov, director of Chabad of Clearwater, has dedicated a giant Hanukkah menorah in honor of the victims of the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, Calif., Paris and Israel. \n The menorah, which stands on the front lawn of the Jewish center at 2280 Belleair Road, is a symbolic 44 feet wide. Hodakov said that corresponds to the 44 candles that are lit on the menorah each year during the eight-day holiday of Hanukkah, also spelled Chanukah. \n This year, the holiday started Sunday night Dec.6 and ends Monday evening. Dec. 14 \n Known as the Festival of Lights, Hanukkah commemorates a military victory by a small band of Jewish freedom fighters, known as the Maccabees, over Greek/Syrian forces and the rededication of the second Holy Temple in Jerusalem. \n After the temple was liberated and its defenders entered, they found only enough oil in the menorah to last one day. But by some miracle, the light burned for eight days - enough time for more oil to be produced, according to the Hanukkah story. \n Chabad of Clearwater's menorah stretches 16 feet wider than the largest menorah in the world, which stands opposite New York's Central Park and measures 28 feet, he said. \n With Hanukkah coming just days after the terrible massacre in California, I felt this would be my community's contribution to adding the light of hope to the world, he said. \n The answer to darkness is to increase the light. \n For more information on Chabad of Clearwater, call (727) 265-2770, visit www.clearwaterjewish.com  or send an e-mail to JewishClearwater@gmail.com .\n\nLoad-Date: December 10, 2015"
