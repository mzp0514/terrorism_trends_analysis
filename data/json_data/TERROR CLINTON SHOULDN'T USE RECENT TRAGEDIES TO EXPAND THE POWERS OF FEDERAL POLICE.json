    "full text": "-\nTHE explosion of TWA Flight 800 and the bombing of Centennial Olympic\nPark in Atlanta were monstrous affronts - the work of despicable men.\nThe nation still grieves for the lives lost and the people injured.\nUnfortunately, President Clinton seized the moment to grab more power\nfor the federal government in the name of fighting terrorism.\nOld bills already rejected by Congress were dusted off and repackaged\nas an \"anti-terrorism law.\"\nClinton's bill would make it easier for federal officials to trace\ntelephone calls. Computer messages would be decoded by the federal\ngovernment. Taggants would be added to a whole bunch of common\nchemicals.\nLet's not throw the Bill of Rights out the window in our attempt to\ndeal with terrorism.\nWe still don't know what happened on TWA Flight 800. As for the\nOlympic explosion, how would tracing phone calls and overseas spying\nstop a local person from making a homemade pipe bomb?\nThe Clinton White House got its hands on the not-so-confidential FBI\nfiles of 900 Republicans. This is being blamed on a political dirty\ntrickster that no one at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. now admits hiring.\nCongress should politely decline the president's request to tread on\nmore liberties in the name of security.\nOh, be impolite. The proposal goes too far.\n\nLoad-Date: August 6, 1996"
