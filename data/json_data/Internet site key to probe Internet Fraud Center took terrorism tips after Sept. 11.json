The then year-old fraud complaint center, operated in tandem by the two organizations, could be altered to accept terrorism tips.\n\"That morning we were all in shock,\" said Richard Johnston, director of the National White Collar Crime Center, the Justice Department-funded facility that provides support services to law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation and prosecution of economic and high-tech crime.\n\"And then they realized we had the type of infrastructure already in place to receive tips over the Web.\"\nWithin an hour or two, the site, www.ifccfbi.gov, had been reformatted to accept tips. Visitors to the site simply could click on an icon, opening up a page for submissions.\nBy the end of the day, the FBI, which actually reviews the information, had sent down the OK from headquarters. Ashcroft made the announcement.\nAt first, the tips trickled in. Then, they came more and more rapidly, in immense volume, from all over the world, swamping the Internet fraud center like a fast-breaking wave.\nAt first, one of the greatest challenges was merely to ensure the sheer number of messages did not overwhelm the fraud center's capacity. Every time Ashcroft mentioned the online tip line during a briefing or the Web address scrolled across the bottom of the television screen during a newscast, the number of incoming messages spiked, Johnston said.\nThe other concern, not surprisingly, was security.\n\"We had some anxious moments,\" says West Virginia auditor Glen Gainer, who is chairman of the National White Collar Crime Center's board of directors.\nOn each of those fronts, the Internet Fraud Complaint Center had help, some from the private sector.\nOne of the first groups to offer assistance was Web technology firm Akamai. The group's co-founder Daniel Lewin was killed when his Los Angeles-bound plane struck one of the Twin Towers.\nIn all, nearly $ 3 million worth of service, hardware and expertise was donated by about a dozen firms, Johnston estimates.\n\"At one point in Fairmont we had three or four of the world's best security people sitting around a table,\" said Johnston, who declines to discuss the specifics of some of the security threats.\nThe center's employees did not actually review the tips, which were handled strictly by FBI agents with higher clearances.\nRep. Alan Mollohan has helped found and fund the center from his perch as a top member of the House Appropriations Committee.\n\"It's an amazing story,\" Mollohan, D-W.Va., said. \"They did a tremendous job.\"\nIn recent weeks, the FBI has taken over the terrorism tip line, allowing the center to refocus on fraud complaints. However, center officials hope the experience with the terrorism tip line will show state and federal governments the value of offering people the ability to share homeland defense information securely online, especially as the new Department of Homeland Security takes shape.\n\"It was nice to be able to help when most Americans were sitting wondering how,\" Johnston said.\nWriter Karin Fischer can be reached at (202) 662-8732 or by e-mail at kfischer@dailymail.com.  \n\nLoad-Date: November 30, 2002"
