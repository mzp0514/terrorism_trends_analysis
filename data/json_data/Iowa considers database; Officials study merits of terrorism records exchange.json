Tom Vilsack. She said Vilsack will make a final decision after receiving a recommendation from the Department of Public Safety.\nThe program uses high-speed computers to give authorities a trove of information about people within seconds, including details on the property, boats, and Internet domains they own, their address history, names of possible neighbors and business associates, utility connections and any bankruptcy filings.\nSupporters of the program say it is an efficient search engine for public records in sensitive crime and terrorism investigations and that the program will be monitored for misuse. Information will be provided on a need-to-know basis, they say.\nBut Stone said the program creates a dossier on every American and it \"sounds like 'assume everybody in America is a suspect and eliminate people from that list',\" he said.\n\"It is a massive invasion of privacy under the guise of fighting terrorism,\" Stone said. \"The fact that Iowa is interested in this really demonstrates this isn't closely linked to terrorism. This is about broad police powers.\"\nFlorida, Connecticut, Michigan, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania are running the program. Utah's governor on Thursday halted the state's participation and at least eight other states have considered joining before dropping out, citing privacy or long-term cost concerns.\nSince 1984, Iowa has run a program called the Law Enforcement Intelligence Network that shares information with local authorities around the state. That has helped investigators with different agencies work together, officials say.\n\"What Matrix has the potential to do is expand that beyond Iowa's borders - maybe allow us the ability to get information that has some nexus to what's going on here,\" Saunders said.\nHe said the intelligence network provides information relevant to individuals or groups suspected of criminal activity. Matrix is a collection of public information used only for anti-terrorism purposes, he said.\n\nLoad-Date: February 1, 2004"
