    "full text": "Republican candidate Thom Tillis for the U.S. Senate has generally run a fact-free campaign, glossing over his own poor record as House speaker and unfairly attacking his opponent, incumbent Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan. But his new television commercials essentially blaming Hagan for Islamic terrorism are dishonest and despicable examples of a man who will say anything and do anything, no matter how low, to win. And these commercials are so far below the belt they're down near the shoelaces.\nOne ad shows a Union County woman who's a veteran, military wife, and mother of two marines who says President Obama \"has allowed the Islamic State to grow. And Sen. Hagan? She just goes right along with him. We can't let our kids die in vain. We have to change our senator.\"\nA second ad accuses Hagan of not paying attention to the rise of ISIS in Iraq and Syria because she did not attend enough Armed Services committee meetings. The point of both ads is not to convey any useful information to voters but simply to use truly troubling foreign events as an excuse to link Hagan emotionally with an unpopular president. Previous commercials have smeared Hagan by blaming her for the poor economy and for the passage of Obamacare, even though the \"facts\" in the ads are old and sometimes outdated Republican talking points, factually discredited, that have little or no connection with reality.\nBut accusing Hagan of fostering terrorism is beyond preposterous. The first-term senator, one of only 100 and ranked by observers as a moderate, is in no position to have any more individual responsibility for the nation's foreign policy -- or economy or health care -- than any other senator, including Republican Sen. Richard Burr. In fact, she voted for a bipartisan bill to train and equip moderate Syrian rebels, and she supports the air strikes that are now underway, just as polls show most Americans do. Tillis won't even take a firm position.\nMillions of dollars have been poured into North Carolina from outside conservative groups to attack Kay Hagan. They generally vary from unfair to untrue. That's part of modem American politics. It doesn't make them less trashy. But accusing Hagan of promoting terrorism, and implying she's not patriotic, goes beyond trashy. It's the foulest of garbage that says more about Tillis than Hagan.\n\nLoad-Date: February 27, 2016"
