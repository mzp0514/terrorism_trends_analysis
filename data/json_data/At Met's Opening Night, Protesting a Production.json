    "full text": "Some traditions of opening night at the Metropolitan Opera go back decades, like beginning with ''The Star-Spangled Banner,'' while others are more recent, like showing the operas free on outdoor movie screens at Lincoln Center and Times Square. When operagoers arrived for opening night on Monday, they were greeted with an even newer tradition: street protests.\nSeveral hundred protesters gathered outside the Met before the performance of Mozart's ''Le Nozze di Figaro'' for a noisy demonstration calling for the company to cancel its production of John Adams's 1991 opera, ''The Death of Klinghoffer,'' which is to have its Met premiere next month. That opera depicts a 1985 cruise ship hijacking by members of the Palestine Liberation Front, and the killing of a disabled Jewish American passenger, Leon Klinghoffer.\nIt was the second opening night in a row at the Met to attract protests: Last season began with Tchaikovsky's ''Eugene Onegin,'' and drew demonstrators who urged the Met and the Russian artists in the opera to speak out against Russian laws limiting discussion of homosexuality, signed by President Vladimir V. Putin.\nThe protesters on Monday held up signs that said ''Metropolitan Nazi Opera,'' ''Stop the Hate -- Defund Met Opera'' and, in a question aimed at Peter Gelb, the general manager of the Met, ''Gelb Are You Taking Terror ?'' One speaker called for the opera's sets to be ''burned to the ground.''\nFormer Gov. George E. Pataki, Representative Eliot L. Engel of New York, State Assemblyman Dov Hikind and State Assemblyman David I. Weprin were among the officials who denounced the opera and the Met for showing it. ''This is the wrong show at the wrong time,'' Mr. Pataki said. A letter denouncing the opera, by the father of Daniel Pearl, a journalist slain by terrorists in 2002, was read aloud.\nThe ''Klinghoffer'' protests have been brewing for months. In June, Mr. Gelb, scrapped plans to transmit ''Klinghoffer'' live to movie theaters around the world this fall after Jewish groups raised objections.\nMr. Gelb's decision to cancel the movie theater transmission was criticized by some free-speech groups but praised by the Anti-Defamation League, which said at the time that ''while the opera itself is not anti-Semitic, there is a concern the opera could be used in foreign countries to stir up anti-Israel sentiments or as a vehicle to promote anti-Semitism.''\nBut at the protest, speaker after speaker described the opera as anti-Semitic and said that it glorified terrorism.\nOn Monday morning, Rabbi Avi Weiss of the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale, in the Bronx, led a small group in prayers for Mr. Klinghoffer on Monday morning in a small park across from Lincoln Center. He said that he ''absolutely'' hoped that the Met would cancel the production. Like many opponents, he said he had not heard ''Klinghoffer'': ''I've not seen it, but I've heard enough about it and I don't want to see it, frankly.''\nThe opera's subject matter has always been incendiary. At a rehearsal last week Tom Morris, the opera's director, told the cast that the work dramatizes terrorism, but does not condone it any more than Verdi's ''Otello,'' based on Shakespeare, ''tells people to kill their wives.''\nMr. Gelb said in an interview that ''the opera is neither anti-Semitic or a glorification of terrorism'' and described Mr. Adams as the ''leading American composer of opera,'' whose major works have been presented at the Met in recent seasons.\n''It is, I believe, the best music he's composed of all,'' Mr. Gelb said of ''Klinghoffer.''\n''It's a great artistic work of genius, and there is absolutely no reason for it to be suppressed.''\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/23/arts/music/protests-over-klinghoffer-planned-for-mets-opening-night.html\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO: Met Opera patrons on Monday passed protesters who disapprove of the coming production of ''The Death of Klinghoffer.''
