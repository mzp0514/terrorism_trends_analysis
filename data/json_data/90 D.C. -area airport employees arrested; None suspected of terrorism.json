Another has pleaded guilty, and the other three await court dates, he said.\nAs of April 19, 12 other Hartsfield workers remained in federal detention centers on charges of being in the country illegally, Crosby said. All face deportation.\nIn Tuesday's sweep in Washington, several employees, including two baggage screeners, lied on applications to get security badges, he said.\nThe most common violation was falsifying a Social Security number. Four employees at Dulles International Airport in Virginia were found to be \"fugitives from justice,\" wanted on various state charges.\nNone of those arrested is suspected to be involved in terrorism, federal officials said.\n\"If convicted, many of these defendants face maximum penalties that range from two to 10 years in prison, plus up to a $250,000 fine,\" Ashcroft said.\nU.S. Attorney Paul McNulty said more raids will likely be carried out across the country because uneven screening of airport employees presents a \"potential for harm.\"\nOne baggage screener at both Reagan National and Dulles was arrested; both worked for Atlanta-based Argenbright Security, McNulty said.\nOne was arrested for falsifying a criminal history record and the other was arrested for providing a false Social Security number, he added.\nJohn Magaw, head of the U.S. Transportation Security Agency, noted that the federal government is taking over airport security from private companies like Argenbright. A complete federal takeover is slated to be finished by November.\n--- Mary Lou Pickel contributed to this report\n\nLoad-Date: April 24, 2002"
