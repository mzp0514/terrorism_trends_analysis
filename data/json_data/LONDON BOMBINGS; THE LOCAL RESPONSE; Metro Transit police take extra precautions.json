    "full text": "The bombings in London should remind Minnesotans that the terrorism threat is still very real, FBI special agent Paul McCabe said Thursday.\nAlthough the FBI wasn't aware of any specific or credible threats against the Twin Cities or the United States, raising the security alert from yellow to orange for mass transit put more police officers at bus and light-rail stops, Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport and the Mall of America. And state officials recommended resuming some transit services that have been shut down during the state budget stalemate.\nJack Nelson, chief of Metro Transit police, said law enforcement officials throughout the metro area offered officers and bomb sniffing dogs. Bus and light-rail drivers were reminded to inspect vehicles before and after their shifts, and waste containers were removed from rail platforms. A similar plan was put into effect after last year's train bombings in Madrid, Nelson said. The increased presence will remain until federal and local intelligence agencies dictate otherwise, he said.\nThe light rail tunnel between the Humphrey and Lindbergh airport terminals has some of the world's finest anti-intrusion equipment, but extra officers were still shifted to patrol it, Nelson said. The airport police had all six canine teams on duty Thursday as a safeguard and to reassure passengers, said Patrick Hogan, spokesman for the Metropolitan Airports Commission.\n\"We are clearly on top of the situation,\" said Michael Campion, state public safety commissioner.\nGov. Tim Pawlenty, who held a morning news conference with Campion at the State Capitol, said that although no credible, known terrorism threats affect either Minnesota or the United States, no one should discount Minnesota as a possible target.\nJudging by the number of terror-related prosecutions in Minnesota, he said, \"we've had our share of terrorism concerns and more.\" But, he added, \"We encourage people not to alter their plans and go about their daily lives as normal.\"\nPawlenty also said state authorities remain \"able to fully respond\" to a terror attack despite the partial state government shutdown.\nMeanwhile, Edward Stringer, the special master in charge of hearing pleas for continuation of essential state services during the shutdown, said he will recommend resumption of several functions that Pawlenty said could be vital to public safety: highway message boards, the Highway Helper freeway emergency assistance and live traffic camera feeds to law enforcement agencies and the Internet.\nThe bombings didn't appear to keep people from taking light rail or buses Thursday morning. Tom Workman, 25, hadn't heard about the bombings as he headed to a friend's home on Franklin Avenue in Minneapolis.\n\"Terrorism only works if you let it scare you,\" he said. \"You've got to go on with your daily life. Otherwise, terrorism wins.\"\nSome said they have to take public transportation because they don't own a vehicle. Trish Unger, who was in town from Phoenix to visit relatives, said her husband's biggest fear was the bus breaking down and having no air conditioning, not terrorists.\nWhen passengers arrived by train at the Mall of America, guards boarded and searched between seats. Lt. Bob Elmers of the Metro Transit police walked onto the train with Radar, a German shepherd who wore a police badge around his collar. Elmers walked the dog up and down the train, allowing kids to pet it.\nRadar can smell explosives, track people and search buildings. The two were looking for any packages left behind and evidence of tampering with the train.\n\"But basically, we're out here for the high visibility,\" he said. \"People feel good having the officers out.\"\nThe writers are at dchanen@startribune.com and azayas@startribune.com.   \n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO\n\nLoad-Date: July 8, 2005"
