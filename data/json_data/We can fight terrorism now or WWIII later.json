    "full text": "TO THE EDITOR:\nInternational peace is an objective and hope of everyone.  However, I happen to disagree with the peaceniks who have written so many letters to you about their pacifism preferences in regard to Iraq.\n#FRANK.DEC294#In my view, prevention of World War III should supersede their pleas for peace now.\nI lived through World War II. Columnist George Will has shown so dramatically how postwar inspections for weapons in Germany by the World War I victors failed to detect preparations for World War II, and how appeasement of the German government failed even when the allied governments had a far superior military power.\nConsider my generation without World War II (if Hitler had been deposed in the early 1930s). Wake up, peaceniks! Learn from history.\nI don't want my Christian grandchildren to fight Muslims in World War III. If Saddam had kept Kuwait without the Desert Storm battle, Arabia and Egypt would have capitulated soon without much resistance. A global war of Christians vs. Muslims would have followed. Don't bring on World War III. Use common sense!\nAnti-American terrorism is difficult for us to comprehend. Let them win, however, and peaceniks will all be on your knees begging for your lives to be spared. Please study history!\nBill Frankhouser, Elizabethtown\n\nLoad-Date: December 25, 2002"
