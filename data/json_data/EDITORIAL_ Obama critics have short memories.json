    "full text": "Jan. 11--Speaking on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" last week, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani claimed that the United States \"had no domestic attacks\" during President George W. Bush's administration.\nGiuliani was contrasting President Barack Obama's approach to terrorism with Bush's.\n\"We had no domestic attacks under Bush,\" Giuliani said. \"We've had one under Obama.\" Giuliani was referring to the failed Christmas Day attempt by suspected terrorist Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab to blow up a Northwest airliner.\nGiuliani, mayor of New York on Sept. 11, 2001, when two hijacked airliners crashed into the World Trade Center towers, later told CNN he misspoke.\nIt is quite possible Giuliani forgot the failed attack of would-be shoe-bomber Richard Reid in December 2001, but does he really expect the American people to believe he forgot about 9/11?\nThe Republican rhetoric about terrorism has not stopped since the failed Christmas Day attempt -- an attempt as inept as Reid's.\nTo see more of the Decatur Daily or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.decaturdaily.com.
