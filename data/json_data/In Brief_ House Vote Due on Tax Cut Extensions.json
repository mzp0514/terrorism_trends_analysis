    "full text": "The House is scheduled to vote today on legislation to extend expiring\ntax cuts and the government's terrorism insurance program.\nThe tax package contains $56.1 billion of cuts, including preserved rate\nreductions on capital gains and dividends, as well as an exemption that\nfinancial services companies receive on foreign earnings. A competing bill\nthe Senate passed last month would not extend these cuts.\nThe House is also set to vote on a bill that would keep the terrorism\ninsurance program in place through 2007 but narrow its scope considerably, so\nthat insurers would have to cover a larger share of claims.\nUnder current law, the government would have had to pay claims of over $5\nmillion. Under the House bill and a similar one the Senate approved last\nmonth, taxpayers' obligation would kick in on claims of over $50 million next\nyear and over $100 million in 2007.\nOn Thursday a House Financial Services subcommittee is scheduled to hold\na hearing on housing issues in the areas ravaged by hurricanes Katrina and\nRita.\nThough the House returned from its extended Thanksgiving recess this\nweek, the Senate will reconvene Monday. Both chambers are expected to recess\nlater this month.\nhttp://www.americanbanker.com            http://www.sourcemedia.com \n\nLoad-Date: October 31, 2006"
