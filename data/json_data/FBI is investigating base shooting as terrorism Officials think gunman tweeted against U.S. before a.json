    "full text": "PENSACOLA, Fla. - The Saudi gunman who killed three people at the Pensacola naval base had apparently gone on Twitter shortly before the shooting to blast U.S. support of Israel and accuse America of being anti-Muslim, a U.S. official said Sunday as the FBI confirmed it is operating on the assumption the attack was an act of terrorism.\n Investigators are also trying to establish whether the killer, 2nd Lt. Mohammed Alshamrani, 21, of the Royal Saudi Air Force, acted alone or was part of a larger plot.\n Alshamrani, who was killed by a sheriff's deputy during the rampage at a classroom building Friday, was undergoing flight training at Pensacola, where members of foreign militaries routinely receive instruction.\n \"We are, as we do in most active-shooter investigations, working with the presumption that this was an act of terrorism,\" said Rachel J. Rojas, the special agent in charge of the FBI's office in Jacksonville.\n Authorities believe the gunman made social media posts criticizing the U.S. under a user handle similar to his name, but federal law enforcement officials are investigating whether he authored the words or just posted them, said the official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\n All foreign students at the Pensacola base have been accounted for, no arrests have been made, and the community is under no immediate threat, Rojas said at a news conference. A Saudi  officer has ordered all students from the country to remain at one location at the base, authorities said.\n \"There are a number of Saudi students who are close to the shooter and continue to cooperate in this investigation,\" Rojas said. \"The Saudi government has pledged to fully cooperate with our investigation.\"\n Earlier in the week, Alshamrani hosted a dinner party where he and three others watched videos of mass shootings, another U.S. official told the AP on Saturday.\n Family members and others identified the three dead as Joshua Kaleb Watson, a 23-year-old graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy; Airman Mohammed Sameh Haitham, 19, of St. Petersburg, Florida, who joined the Navy after graduating from high school last year; and Airman Apprentice Cameron Scott Walters, 21, of Richmond Hill, Georgia.\n The official who spoke Saturday said one of the three students who attended the dinner party hosted by the attacker recorded video outside the classroom building while the shooting was taking place. Two other Saudi students watched from a car, the official said.\n In a statement, the FBI confirmed Sunday that it had obtained base surveillance videos as well as cellphone footage taken by a bystander outside the building, and had also interviewed that person.\n Rojas said federal authorities are focused on questioning the gunman's friends, classmates and other associates. \"Our main goal is to confirm if he acted alone or was he part of a larger network,\" she said.\n The U.S. has long had a robust training program for Saudis, providing assistance in the U.S. and in the kingdom. More than 850 Saudis are in the United States for various training activities. They are among more than 5,000 foreign students from 153 countries in the U.S. going through military training.\n Foreigners allowed into the U.S. for military training are subject to background checks for  security risks.\n \"This has been done for many decades,\" President Trump said on Saturday. \"I guess we're going to have to look into the whole procedure. We'll start that immediately.\"\n\nLoad-Date: December 9, 2019"
