Bill Young never shied from the political largesse he secured for Pinellas County and Florida - and over the years he used his clout to bring back hundreds of millions.\n\"We get calls on a regular basis from people saying 'I'm against earmarks,'\" he told the Tampa Bay Times in a 2010 interview. \"Well, I say, 'Are you opposed to fixing U.S. 19, to make it a safe highway?' 'Oh, no, no.' 'Well, that was an earmark.' I say, 'Are you opposed to building that new hospital for veterans?' 'No, absolutely not.' 'Well, that was an earmark.' The trouble is the media has reported earmarks as something evil without actually reporting exactly what earmarks can do. I would agree that probably some of the congressional earmarks should have never been approved and there probably should have been a better system.\"\nIt's almost impossible to know exactly how much Young secured because disclosure was not required until 2007. But 2010, the final year before earmarks were banned, provides a vivid illustration of Young's reach.\n(Note: This is a list of the \"solo\" earmarks and excludes a not-insignificant amount Young secured with other lawmakers. Also, the odd descriptions are often defense industry related projects.)\n* * *\n$21 million|Consolidated Communications Facility|\n$4 million|Cooperative Engagement Capability|\n$4 million|Maritime Domain Awareness and Maritime Security Technology Pilot, SRI International|\n$4 million|Reduced Manning Situational Awareness|\n$4 million|SHARK Precision Guided Artillery Round-105mm|\n$3.2 million|Comprehensive Maritime Domain Awareness|\n$3 million|High Performance Thermal Battery Infrastructure Project|\n$2.8 million|Multi-Jurisdictional Counter-Drug Task Force Training|\n$2.8 million|National Terrorism Preparedness Institute, Anti-Terrorism/ Counter-Terrorism Technology Development and Training|\n$2.4 million|Advanced Electronic Components for Sensor Arrays|\n$2.4 million|Autonomous Marine Sensors and Networks for Rapid Littoral Assessment|\n$2.4 million|Battlefield Sensor Netting|\n$2.4 million|Florida National Guard Total Force Integration|\n$2.4 million|Military/Law Enforcement Counterterrorism Test Bed|\n$2.4 million|Next Generation Scalable Lean Manufacturing Initiative-Phase Two|\n$2 million|National Forensic Science Technology Center, Forensic Technology Center of Excellence|\n$2 million|WMD Civil Support Team for Florida|\n$1.6 million|Advanced Battery Technology|\n$1.6 million|Advanced Detection of Explosives|\n$1.6 million|BATMAV Program Miniature Digital Data Link|\n$1.6 million|CBRN Detection Unmanned Aircraft|\n$1.6 million|Countermeasures to Combat Protozoan Parasites (Toxoplasmosis and Malaria)|\n$1.6 million|Expansion of the Forensic Intelligence Technologies and Training Support Center of Excellence|\n$1.6 million|Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Global Sensors Architecture|\n$1.6 million|United States Special Operations Command-USSOCOM/ STAR-TEC Partnership Program|\n$1.5 million|St. Petersburg College National Terrorism Preparedness Institute|\n$1.2 million|WMD Civil Support Team for Florida|\n$1 million|Advanced Conductivity Program|\n$1 million|St. Petersburg Solar Pilot Project|\n$1 million|St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport|\n\nLoad-Date: October 10, 2013"
