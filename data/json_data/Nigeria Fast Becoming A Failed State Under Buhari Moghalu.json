Moghalu also said that it is a national shame that the government is concerned about the #EndSARS protesters while nothing is done to terrorists.\n The political economist and lawyer, was reacting to the massacre of rice farmers by suspected Boko Haram terrorists in Borno state. In a series of tweets on his Twitter page, Moghalu lamented the current insecurity in the country and the President's inability to secure lives and property.\n \"The recent tragedy shows Nigeria is becoming a failed state under Buhari\", he said.  Moghalu tweeted: \"The barbaric beheading of 43 Nigerians in Zabarmari village in Borno State by Boko Haram is a national outrage and tragedy.\n It's increasingly clear that @NigeriaGov is unable to protect the lives of Nigerians. What does that mean? Our country is becoming a failed state.\n \"It is a travesty that a government that can't protect the lives of its citizens spends all its energy attempting to suppress #EndSARS peaceful protesters, freezing their bank accounts and bringing spurious legal charges. \"Our government and our Central Bank call peaceful citizens 'financiers of terrorism' while the real terrorists are having a field day with Nigerian lives and no one apparently can stop them and their real financiers.\n It is a national shame\", Moghalu tweeted. \"The real challenge we face: Can Nigeria survive until 2023 without a massive implosion? #NoSecurity #NoEconomy.\n What's left? #Restructuring\", he asked. \n\nLoad-Date: December 3, 2020"
