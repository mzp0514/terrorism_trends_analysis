Dane D. Rideout, Garrison Commander, do hereby proclaim August 2012 as Antiterrorism Awareness Month in the West Point Community and urge all citizens, Government agencies, public and private institutions and businesses to invest in the power of prevention and work together to make West Point and our surrounding communities a safer and stronger place to live.\n\nLoad-Date: September 18, 2013"
