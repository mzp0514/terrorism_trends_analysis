    "full text": "To protest cuts in antiterrorism funding for the Twin Cities' east metro area, Minnesota's two senators indicated this week that they might block the nomination of Bernard Kerik to head the Department of Homeland Security.\n     Sen.\nNorm Coleman, a Republican, said Thursday that he is \"outraged\" and Democrat Mark Dayton called it \"nonsensical\" and suggested that he might put a hold on Kerik's nomination.\n     President Bush tapped Kerik, a former New York City police commissioner, last week to replace Tom Ridge, who resigned.\n     The department said it is cutting Minnesota's share of funding to shift more money to cities deemed at high risk for terrorism, such as New York. Overall homeland security funding to Minnesota will drop from $39.5 million to $31.7 million.\n     Special urban grants are being cut as well. Last year, the department awarded $19.5 million to Minneapolis and St. Paul and Dakota, Hennepin and Ramsey counties. Now only Minneapolis and Hennepin County will qualify for a total of $5.7 million.\n     It's a \"lame bureaucratic decision by someone who doesn't understand the nature of the Twin Cities,\" Coleman said. \"Minneapolis and St. Paul are joined at the hip.\"\n     Said Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum, whose district includes St. Paul: \"President Bush ran for reelection telling us that we need to fear terrorism, but now he's taking away our ability to fight terrorism.\"\n     Coleman said that he supports Kerik's nomination, and that he believes the money can be restored.\n\nLoad-Date: December 10, 2004"
