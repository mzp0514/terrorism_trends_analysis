    "full text": "On MPBN, a so-called Middle East expert - a Mr. Goldman - pointed out that President-elect Obama, while visiting one of the illegal settlements in Israel, commented that he wouldn't like to have rockets menacing his children (who would?). Mr. Goldman then said the president-elect would be held to that commitment. Earlier in the fall, the father of one of Mr. Obama's principal advisers - Rahm Emanuel - claimed in an Israeli newspaper that his son would be telling the new president what to do in regard to Israel. The young Emanuel holds dual American-Israeli citizenship and spent his adolescent summer years in Israeli training camps.\nIsrael's decades-long creeping genocide against the Palestinians continues with the usual shelling of civilian infrastructure - mosques, schools, hospitals - with 355 Palestinians already killed as I write. Among other atrocities, the deceptively named Israel Defense Force bombed the home of a Palestinian family, killing five sisters,  ages 5 to 17, as they slept in their bedroom. Terrorists? Hopefully, the new president will have read that news.\nWorld opinion rightly condemns Israel's state-supported terrorism. We Americans send $6 billion each year to support it, recession or no recession. The EU, China, Russia, India, and of course the U.N. have all denounced the slaughter, and they all have to be our essential allies in combating the other kinds of terrorism. Once again, the United Nations, the world's greatest fighter for human rights, is under attack by Israel and the Bush government for speaking the truth. Many American Jews even turn their backs on their long heritage of fighting oppression and support Israel's murderous contempt for its innocent victims.\nStanley Harrison\nSedgwick\n\nLoad-Date: January 5, 2009"
