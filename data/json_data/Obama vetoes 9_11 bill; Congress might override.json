    "full text": "WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama rejected a bill Friday that would have allowed the families of 9/11 victims to sue the government of Saudi Arabia, arguing it undermined national security and setting up the possibility Congress might override his veto for the first time in his presidency.\nObama's move escalates the fight over an emotional issue that has overlapped with the campaign debate over terrorism and the Middle East. The bill had sailed through both chambers of Congress with bipartisan support, clearing the final hurdle just days before the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania.\nThe president said the bill, which doesn't refer specifically to Saudi Arabia, could backfire by opening up the U.S. government and its officials to lawsuits by anyone accusing the U.S. of supporting terrorism, rightly or wrongly.\n\"I have deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001,\" Obama wrote to the Senate in a veto message about the bill, the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. But, he said, \"the JASTA would be detrimental to U.S. national interests more broadly.\"\nCongress is determined to try to override the veto, which requires a two-thirds vote in the House and Senate. Previous attempts to override Obama's vetoes have all failed.\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has said an override would pass in the Republican-controlled House. Yet the Senate would be the greater challenge. After furious lobbying to try to peel off supporters, the White House said Friday it was unclear whether enough had defected to avert an override.\nWith lawmakers eager to return home to campaign, a vote could come early next week. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office said the Senate would vote \"as soon as practicable in this work period.\"\nSen. Chuck Schumer, of New York, the Senate's No. 3 Democrat and a traditional Obama ally, predicted lawmakers would reverse the veto \"swiftly and soundly.\"\n\"The families of the victims of 9/11 deserve their day in court, and justice for those families shouldn't be thrown overboard because of diplomatic concerns,\" Schumer said.\nA coalition of 9/11 victims' families, meanwhile, said they were \"outraged and dismayed.\" In a response circulated by their lawyers, the families insisted the bill would deter terrorism, \"no matter how much the Saudi lobbying and propaganda machine may argue otherwise.\"\nThough the concept of sovereign immunity generally shields governments from lawsuits, the bill creates an exception that allows foreign governments to be held responsible if they support a terrorist attack that kills U.S. citizens on American soil. Opponents say that's a slippery slope considering that the U.S. is frequently accused wrongly by its foes of supporting terrorism.\n\"Americans are in countries all over the world,\" House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry, a Republican, wrote Friday in a letter urging colleagues to support a veto. \"Many of those countries do not respect the rule of law, and we cannot expect their responses to be as measured and narrow as ours.\"\n\nLoad-Date: October 12, 2016"
