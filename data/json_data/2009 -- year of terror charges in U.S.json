But an agency spokesman said 2009 had more defendants charged with terrorism than any year since the 2001 attacks. The year that came closest was 2002, said the spokesman, Dean Boyd.\nBruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University, called it \"an extraordinary year, across the board,\" adding that the wide range of cases show al-Qaida \"is in it for the long haul and we need to be as well.\"\nThe rate of terrorism charges accelerated in September, when authorities disrupted what they said was a burgeoning plot to detonate bombs aboard New York commuter trains. The quick pace of cases continued until the end of the year, with an attempted Christmas bombing aboard a Detroit-bound airliner.\nOne day alone was particularly heavy: On Sept. 24, federal prosecutors announced charges in five separate terrorism cases in Illinois, New York, North Carolina and Texas.\nDavid Kris, the top terrorism official in the Obama administration's Justice Department, marveled at the volume of terrorism cases when he spoke at a conference of lawyers in November.\n\"The last several weeks or months have been kind of a crucible experience for us,\" Kris said.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nFILE - In this Sept. 30, 2009, file photo FBI Director Robert Mueller, center, flanked by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, left, and Director of the National Counterterrorism Center Michael Leiter, testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee hearing on terrorist threats to the United States.
