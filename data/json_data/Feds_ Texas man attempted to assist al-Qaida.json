    "full text": "WASHINGTON - The Justice Department alleged Thursday in a new terrorism case that a Texas man communicated with the fugitive al-Qaida cleric whose name surfaced in the shootings at Fort Hood.\nCourt documents say Barry Walter Bujol, of Hempstead, Texas, had been communicating via e-mail with Anwar al-Awlaki, a native-born U.S. citizen who exchanged e-mails with the alleged Fort Hood gunman, Army psychiatrist Nidal Malik Hasan.\nA federal grand jury indictment in Houston alleges that Bujol attempted to supply al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula with personnel, currency and other items.\nThe court documents say that al-Awlaki gave Bujol a document titled \"42 Ways of Supporting Jihad\" and that Bujol asked al-Awlaki for advice on how to provide money to the \"mujahideen\" overseas.\nAl-Awlaki is believed to have inspired attacks on the U.S. and is hiding in Yemen, two Yemeni security officials said Wednesday. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not permitted to brief journalists.\nBujol made three unsuccessful attempts in February and March 2009 to depart the country and travel overseas to Yemen or the Middle East, the court documents say.\nBujol, 29, faces a maximum 15-year prison term if convicted of attempting to provide support for al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and five years if convicted of using a fake identification card.\nThe FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force began investigating Bujol in 2008 and according to documents in the case, the FBI introduced a confidential source who Bujol believed was an operative of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nLoad-Date: June 4, 2010"
