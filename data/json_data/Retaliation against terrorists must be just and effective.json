    "full text": "Because retaliation is the best weapon against terrorism, targeting known terrorists wherever they are is justified.\nBut retaliation must be precise and effective, a deterrent against future terrorism.\nIt must be based on credible evidence the terrorists singled out for destruction are a threat to the United States.  And retaliation must never be a political gesture.\nIt seems that Thursday's cruise missile attacks on a suspected terrorist training camp in Afghanistan and a chemical factory in Sudan were for good reason.\nHowever, Tomahawk missiles are indiscriminate in causing devastation.  When the United States retaliated against Libya in 1986, fighter bombers were used in sustained attacks and caused massive damage to Moammar Gadhafi's terrorist organization.\nAs President Clinton explained, the missile raid was timed to disrupt a \"gathering of key terrorist leaders\" at the Afghanistan camp site.  But national security adviser Samuel R. Berger said U.S. officials were not after Osama bin Laden, the terrorist leader suspected of sponsoring the recent bombings of two American embassies.  Indeed, bin Laden has survived the raid.\nThere is no consensus on whether using military might is the best way to stomp out international terrorism.  Tracking down terrorists and bringing them to justice may take more time but seems more effective.\nViolating the territories of two sovereign nations is no small matter, and Washington will be criticized for its action.  However, when terrorists such as bin Laden declare war on America, the United States has every right to defend itself.\nThe success of Thursday's missile attack will be determined by the long-range results.  However, the sad irony of Clinton's presidency is that his motives will be viewed with skepticism even when he does the right thing.\n\nLoad-Date: August 28, 1998"
