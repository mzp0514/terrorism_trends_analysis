    "full text": "After reading George Atwood's opinion of Harley-Davidson motorcycle, my first thought was narrow-minded and ignorant.\nThen I looked at the www.noisefree.org Web site and concluded that these people are a bunch of whiners who are probably offended by the noise of falling snow.\nIf these people want quiet, then they'll have to move to the country with no neighbors. Anywhere else and they're going to be surrounded by people - and people make noise.\nGet used to it, get over it and stop complaining. The noise you're emitting offends me.\n- John Tramburg, Oxford\nDon't blame riders for stealing your girlfriend\nI was taken aback by Sunday's quote from Noise Free America, berating the Harley-Davidson motorcycle.\nOver four decades, most of my bikes have been Harleys. It's distressing to be blamed for everything short of male pattern baldness and blocking health care reform.\nI'd like to offer a differing theory to explain this man's angst. I think some Harley rider stole his girlfriend.\nMy bike is heavily modified. In leaving my home for the highway, I ride through an upscale neighborhood. I've never received a warning from law enforcement or my neighbors for loud pipes.\nMost times I don't wear a helmet when riding, simply to enjoy a sunny day. As any interstate commuter can tell you, serious highway noise does not come from motorcycles. It comes from the wind displacement, air brakes and diesel engines of over-the-road trucks. In heavy traffic, I don't hear another Harley until it pulls along side.\nSo I return to the loss of this man's old flame. Admittedly, we Harley riders are burly and roguishly handsome specimens of the American male. Who can fault this unknown women?\nBut to criticize the motorcycle seems like a cheap shot.\n- Chico Buller, Sun Prairie\nNoise group should focus on true terrorism\nNoise terrorism group to fight noise pollution?\nWhat next?\nWill children be told to be quiet at city parks and backyards? Will ball games and concerts have to be conducted quietly? Will the Fourth of July have to go extinct?\nMaybe all the energy this group has should be used to help prevent child and spousal abuse and neglect that frightens and intimidates the victims.\nThose really are acts of terrorism.\n- Sharon Johnson, Madison\n\nLoad-Date: December 29, 2009"
