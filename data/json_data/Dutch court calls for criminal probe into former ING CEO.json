He conceded at the time of the 2018 settlement that the bank had failed to do enough to prevent money laundering.\nThe Hague Appeals Court upheld the settlement in a ruling Wednesday and called on prosecutors to open a case against Hamers.\n\"The facts are serious, no settlement has been reached with the director himself, nor has he taken public responsibility for his actions,\" the court said in a statement. The court said that bank directors should not enjoy impunity if they were in charge when breaches of banking regulations happened.\nING said it regrets the decision to prosecute Hamers, saying it \"goes against the assessment of the public prosecutors that, based on the investigation, there are no grounds for a case against ING employees or former employees.\"\nThe leader of a foundation that took the case to the appeals court welcomed the decision to investigate Hamers.\n\"It should not be the case that directors who deliberately act wrongly can ransom themselves at the expense of the shareholders by agreeing to very high fines for only the company and shareholders who are completely innocent,\" said Pieter Lakeman of the Company Information Research Foundation.\n\nLoad-Date: December 11, 2020"
