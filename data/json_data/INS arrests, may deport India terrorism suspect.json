Sikh rebels began a separatist war in 1983, claiming religious and economic discrimination by India's Hindu-dominated government.\nSikh extremists were responsible for the 1984 assassination of Indian Prime Minister Indira Ghandi after government forces attacked the Sikhs' holiest shrine, the Golden Temple of Amritsar. At least 1,000 Sikhs and 200 soldiers were killed.\nAlso arrested in St. Paul were Sandhu's wife, Kamaljeet Kaur, 25, and Pinder Brar, 32, an Indian citizen and Canadian immigrant who met the couple at the airport.\nChild protective officials in the St. Paul area were caring for Sandhu's 6-year-old son, INS spokesman Russ Bergeron said.\nSandhu also has been charged with visa fraud, INS Commissioner Doris Meissner said. He is wanted in India in connection with several terrorist crimes, the INS said, including a September 1993 bus bombing that killed eight and wounded 29 others.\nIndian authorities also believe he was involved in political kidnapping and arms trafficking.\nAuthorities suspect Sandhu entered the United States at New York City last month using false identity papers, said Dean Hove, the INS' acting district director in St. Paul.\n\"We think he was in transit to Canada,\" Hove said, possibly as part of a plan to relocate there.\nSandhu is being held without bond by the INS pending deportation hearings. Bond for his wife was set at $ 50,000.\nBrar also faces deportation and has been charged with possession and use of counterfeit documents.\n\nLoad-Date: August 14, 1995"
