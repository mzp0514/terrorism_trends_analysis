    "full text": "Media reports on the recent shootings and bombing in Norway initially referred to the event as a terror attack and the perpetrator as a terrorist. No less than the Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post rushed out editorial comments using words such as \"jihadist,\" \"al-Qaida\" and \"terrorist\" while using the example of these attacks as reason not to cut our defense budget. Loud-mouthed media types such as Michele Malkin and Andrew Breitbart, among others, used the event to spew their usual anti-Muslim rhetoric.\nBut once it was determined the perpetrator was a blond-haired, blue-eyed Christian, many of these people and publications, in subsequent reports, stopped referring to the attack as terrorism or to this man as a terrorist. Suddenly, he became a \"mentally-ill individual.\" Now, disturbing evidence is coming out that this man was heavily influenced by American Christian bloggers who are campaigning against Muslims.\nFolks, a terrorist is a terrorist, whether the perpetrator gets his inspiration from the Koran or from the Bible, regardless of whether he is a brown man from the Middle East or a white man from Norway who looks like he could be a member of the Beach Boys. Christian terrorists should be held to the same standard as Muslim terrorists, otherwise it's not about terrorism, it's just about hating another culture.\n\nLoad-Date: July 29, 2011"
