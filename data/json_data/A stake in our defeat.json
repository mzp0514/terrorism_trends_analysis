    "full text": "It was with a great deal of anger and disappointment that Majority Leader Harry Reid, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the progressives received Gen. David Petraeus' report that the recent troop reinforcement in Iraq did not result in the coalition military defeat that they had hoped for because such a defeat would help them pick up more congressional seats in the 2008 election as well as the presidency.\nSince the surge did not result in an al-Qaida and insurgent defeat of coalition forces, we can expect that the progressives, led by Moveon.org, the anti-war establishment, the Christian left, Cooperhead senators and the so-called Veterans for Peace, and financed by the multimillionaire-billionaire members of the liberal hate group Moveon.org, will now work even harder for failure, retreat and defeat in the war on terrorism.\nIn summary, the progressives are now invested in failure on the war on terrorism, just as much as the moderates are invested in success. America is at a pivotal crossroad on the war on terrorism where the progressives have a good chance of winning in the domestic war on terrorism. For this reason, the country needs to change course ad head in a new direction.\nRodney Lynch\nRockland\n\nLoad-Date: October 20, 2007"
