Technical and cost proposals must be submitted to the AFRL at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base by March 11.\nThe UAVs would be small enough to be launched by hand. They would provide surveillance and reconnaissance to support battle-zone missions including clearing routes, taking and holding villages, and seizing airfields, according to the AFRL's solicitation.\nThe government reserves the right to award one or more contracts for what could be a $2.2 million program, the solicitation stated.\nThe Pentagon has been pushing to speed deployment of UAVs in support of the U.S. war against terrorism.\nContact this reporter at (937) 225-2242 or jnolan@DaytonDailyNews. com.\n\nLoad-Date: February 15, 2011"
