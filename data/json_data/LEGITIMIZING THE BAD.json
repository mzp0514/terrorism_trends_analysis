    "full text": "To the Editor: Richard Bernstein is correct in pointing out that certain U.N. agen\ncies still provide a variety of useful services (news story March 8). But he misses a crucial point.\nThe U.N.'s good programs tend to legitimize the bad. This is of particular concern because the U.N. has become the foremost legitimizing authority in international affairs.  Thus, the fact that the U.N. helps to eradicate disease or helps to care for refugees lends credibility to outrageous U.N. attacks on the basic institutions of free societies, especially in the United States and in Israel. American culture is characterized in U.N. forums as an ''imperialist'' threat to the identity of other peoples. And Zionism, the movement of Jews to live free in their own land, is labeled ''racism and racial discrimination.'' Beyond attacks on Western values, what the U.N. General Assembly legitimizes these days is violations of the U.N. Charter.  It reinterprets the Charter as a set of revolutionary principles in support of ''armed struggle.'' Contrary to the Charter's central tenet regarding the peaceful settlement of disputes, it unconditionally supports movements that employ and glorify violence, including terrorism. And in fawning on terrorists like the P.L.O. - still committed to the destruction of a member state - the U.N. strengthens fanaticism.\n \n HARRIS O. SCHOENBERG New York, March 9, 1984\nThe writer is director of U.N. affairs at B'nai B'rith International."
