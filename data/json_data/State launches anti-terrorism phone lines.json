Bob Wise on Monday announced the phone number for state residents to call to report suspected terrorists or terrorist acts.\nWise's anti-terrorism West Virginia Watch program can be reached by calling (800) 352-0927.\nWise promoted the program Monday in Charleston, Huntington, Parkersburg and Wheeling.\nThrough West Virginia Watch, responsible citizens are urged to assist police with surveillance of industrial plants, businesses, gas lines, waterways, bridges and other critical structures and natural resources. West Virginia Watch members will patrol designated areas and report suspicious activity to intelligence analysts, who will be staffing the toll-free phone lines.\nCitizens who are not West Virginia Watch members may also call in tips to the toll-free number. The toll-free line is being staffed about 16 hours a day. Within a month, the toll-free number is scheduled to be available 24 hours per day, said State Police Superintendent Howard Hill.\nWise on Monday also introduced the program's statewide coordinator, Jeffery Thompson, a six-year State Police trooper.\nWise has asked county commissions to appoint volunteer West Virginia Watch coordinators.\nWatch members will not have law enforcement authority, nor will they carry firearms.\n\nLoad-Date: February 19, 2002"
