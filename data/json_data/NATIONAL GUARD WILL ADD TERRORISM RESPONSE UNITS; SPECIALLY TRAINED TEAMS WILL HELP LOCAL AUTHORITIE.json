    "full text": "Defense Secretary William Cohen on Thursday ordered the National Guard to form 17 more small, elite units to help states cope quickly with terrorist attacks involving nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.\nThe 22-member teams, which would race to the scene of an attack and help local authorities identify weapons and threats, would be added to 10 such National Guard units already completing intensive training. Missouri and Illinois units were in that first group.\nThe 27 WMD (weapons of mass destruction) teams would use Army and Air Force personnel in the Guard. The units are part of a nationwide civilian and military effort to prepare for what is seen as a growing terrorist threat to the United States.\nThe regional teams will be based in 26 states, with two in California. They will have high-tech protective clothing and mobile detection equipment to identify different types of chemical and biological weapons.\n\"The WMD civil support teams will be able to deploy rapidly, assist local first responders in determining the nature of an attack, provide medical and technical advice\" and identify and prepare for the arrival of state and federal military personnel, Charles Cragin, assistant secretary of defense, said at a news conference.\nThe 27 units are separate from anti-terrorism units already formed by the regular Army, Marine Corps and Coast Guard.\nCragin emphasized that the teams will operate exclusively under state and federal civilian authorities. He and other Pentagon officials stressed this point because civil liberties groups and others had complained when the teams were unveiled in 1998 that the Pentagon was overstepping its legal bounds by performing essentially civilian duties.\n\"They are, in fact, under the command and control primarily of the governors of the states in which they are located and under the operational command and control of the (National Guard) adjutant generals of those states,\" Cragin said.\nFears have been expressed by some on the Internet and elsewhere that the Pentagon program was the first step in imposing military control over the country. Under federal law, military personnel are prohibited from being used for domestic law enforcement duties.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO Photo by THE ASSOCIATED PRESS - Defense Secretary William Cohen meets with Marines at Camp Pendleton, near San Diego, last week.
