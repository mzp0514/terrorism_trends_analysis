    "full text": "MOAMMAR Gadhafi recently celebrated the 25th anniversary of his\nassumption of control of the Libyan government.  His quarter-century\nof rule has been marked by terrorism, political repression, and a\nwacky home brew of socialist and Islamic tenets.\nThe world can thank President Reagan for silencing this nut case\nin 1986 with a strategic bombing of Tripoli in retaliation for the\nbombing of a Berlin discotheque.\nIn 1988, the United Nations finally cut off economic trade with\nGadhafi and Libya following the bombing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie,\nScotland.\nHow sad that it took the world 19 years to finally stand up to\nGadhafi, who along with Fidel Castro, Saddam Hussein and the Kim\nfamily of North Korea continue to threaten civilization with\nterrorism.\nAt his anniversary fete, Gadhafi accused the United States of\nbeing \"crazed with power.\"\nWho? Us?\nAnd he called President Clinton a friend.\nThe president should be insulted.\nThere's only one way of dealing with the Gadhafis of the world\n.  Presidents Reagan and Bush knew how.\nWhen the United States isolates menaces like Gadhafi, the world\nbecomes safer.  When terrorists like Carlos the Jackal run out of\nplaces to hide, isn't it odd how groups such as the Palestine\nLiberation Organization and the Irish Republican Army suddenly want\nto talk peace?\nThe U.N. embargo against Libya must continue as long as Gadhafi\nis in power.  It's unfortunate that 4.5 million Libyans must suffer\nin the meantime.-30-\n\nLoad-Date: January 31, 1995"
