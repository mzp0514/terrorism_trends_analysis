    "full text": "The famous quote \"If I had more time, I would have written less\" is attributed to Mark Twain and Blaise Pascal, among others.\nWhoever said it, the point is a valid one; writing that is clear, tight and in which every word matters doesn't come instantly.\nThat holds true for one-act plays, which are the name of the game at Summer Shorts 2012, running through Sept. 1 at 59E59 Theaters, 59 E. 59th St. Tickets are $25.\nThe sampler, presented in two separate evenings, features the premieres of six playlets by American writers at every stage in their career.\nEstablished dramatists include \"reasons to be pretty\" writer Neil LaBute, whose mini work about a breakup is called \"The Furies,\" and \"I Hate Hamlet\" author Paul Rudnick, whose compact comedy about a flight attendant is titled \"Cabin Pressure.\"\nAlso in the mix are Sam Davis and Sean Hartley's \"Love and Real Estate,\" Nancy Giles' \"The Accidental Pundette,\" Wendy Kesselman's \"Spit\" and James McLure's \"Drive-In Dreams.\"\nA schedule is at summershortsfestival.com.\nThe festival is billed as a celebration of \"theater, summer and the short form.\" And in the case of the reliably hilarious Rudnick - laughter.\nHis bite-sized play starring frequent collaborator Peter Bartlett is a portrait of an airline steward fighting terrorism on a trip to L.A. packed with Golden Globes nominees.\nHe adds, \" It is a story of triumph.\"\nRudnick is totally serious when he says crafting \"a short play is a real science. You have to be extremely concise,\" he acknowledges. \"It's about paring things down and focus. Every second counts.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \n'Drive-In Dreams': From l., Megan Ketch, Connor Buckley, Erin Darke, Nick Gehlfuss. Rahav Iggy Segev/Photopass\n\nLoad-Date: August 3, 2012"
