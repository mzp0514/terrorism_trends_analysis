    "full text": "Lawmakers are scheduled to tackle terrorism insurance, industrial loan\ncompanies, and credit cards at hearings on Capitol Hill this week.\nThe House Financial Services capital markets subcommittee has scheduled a\nhearing for today on modifying and extending the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act.\nThe federal backstop for terrorism risk insurance - which was created after\nthe Sept. 11 attacks - is scheduled to expire at yearend, but House Financial\nServices Chairman Barney Frank, D-Mass., has said it should be reauthorized for\nseveral more years.\nThe insurance and banking industries have argued that continuing the\ngovernment's role is necessary to prevent coverage from becoming unavailable or\nunaffordable.\nOn Wednesday the Financial Services Committee is scheduled to debate ILC\nlegislation. A bill sponsored by Rep. Frank, and Rep. Paul Gillmor, R-Ohio,\neffectively would block commercial firms from owning ILCs. (See story on page\n1.)\nAlso Wednesday, the House Education and Labor Committee plans to hold a\nhearing to examine conflicts of interest and unethical practices in the student\nlending business.\nThe hearing is intended to focus on the nature of relationships between \nlenders and college financial aid officers. Rep. George Miller, the California\nDemocrat who chairs the committee, has said the relationships are tainted by\n\"cronyism.\" New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo is the only witness scheduled\nto testify.\nOn Thursday the House Financial Services financial institutions subcommittee\nwill hold a hearing to review credit cards. A witness list for that hearing has\nnot been released.\nhttp://www.americanbanker.com/            http://www.sourcemedia.com/\n\nLoad-Date: April 23, 2007"
