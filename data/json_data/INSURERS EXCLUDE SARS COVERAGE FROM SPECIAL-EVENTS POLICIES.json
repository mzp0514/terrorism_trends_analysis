Brady, director of Contingency Products Group at the insurance broker, Aon Risk Services Inc.\n\"Insurers don't really understand â€¦ (SARS), and they can't qualify the risk and they don't want to take on any risk until they can figure out more about the disease.\"\nFor example, Chubb Corp. had stopped underwriting event-cancellation p olicies when the war in Iraq began but resumed offering them this week, albeit with a SARS exemption.\nBrokers say the situation is similar to what happened after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when insurers began adding terrorism exemptions to such coverage.\n\"SARS has become the new terrorism,\" said LeConte Moore, managing director of the entertainment and media practice in the New York office of Marsh Inc., a unit of the brokerage firm Marsh & McLennan Cos.\nTerrorism exemptions stopped in the United States, at least, after a law was passed requiring insurers to offer terrorism insurance. Whether the trend in special events policies prompts legislation remains to be seen.\nSpecial events coverage is a tiny sliver of the $160 billion commercial-insurance market, according to the Insurance Information Institute. And most special events policies are written months in advance, so near-term events canceled or hurt because of SARS would be covered. Neither Brady nor Moore said they'd seen any fallout such as canceling an event because of SARS exemptions yet.\n\nLoad-Date: April 19, 2003"
