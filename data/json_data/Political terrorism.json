    "full text": "Lately we hear a great deal regarding two topics of discussion; terrorism and bullying. Unfortunately, we can apply both of those terms to our political machinery.\nOfficially, terrorism is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations as \"the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.\" Our lawmakers might not be using force or violence but they are certainly trying to intimidate and coerce the civilian population with their latest round of stalemates, bickering and lack of bipartisan that shuts down the government and causes thousands of people to be furloughed.\nWhether Democrat, or Republican, didn't we vote these people into office to speak on the behalf of the people and jurisdictions that they represent ... and not the party that they belong to?\nHow can the American public be expected to make compromises and the country recover when the lawmakers who occupy the highest offices in the land can't get along long enough to really look out for the American people? All of us have to live by our budgets. We all have to compromise on our jobs or in our families to come up with workable solutions. Why can't the people that we have put into office do the same?\nThat noise that you just heard is the political terrorist shooting the country in the foot ... once again!\nThe REV. DR. JOSEPH E. POWELL JR.\nCovenant LifeHouse Ministries\nSevern\n\nLoad-Date: October 4, 2013"
