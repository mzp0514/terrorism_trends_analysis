The measure, which would establish a nonprofit organization to streamline the licensing process for insurance agents and brokers operating outside their home states, won approval in the U.S. House of Representatives in September but has yet to be taken up by the full Senate.\n\"We've been very active pushing that legislation,\" said Mr. Symington. He noted that the Senate bill enjoys bipartisan support with more than 25 co-sponsors in the chamber. The Senate failed to pass previous NARAB II legislation. Nevertheless the IIABA is \"cautiously optimistic\" that the measure will win approval in the current Congress.\nAnother key issue for the producer group is extension of the federal government's terrorism insurance backstop initially created by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorism attacks in New York and Washington.\nThe program expires Dec. 31, 2014.\n\"We're spending a lot of time on that. We're part of an industry coalition as well as coordinating with commercial policyholder groups,\" said Mr. Symington.\nHe pointed out that reauthorizing the terrorism insurance program is an issue that \"unites the industry, and that's not an easy thing to do.\"\nMr. Symington explained the IIABA's interest in the issue by noting that \"our guys sell a lot of commercial policies. Commercial property/casualty is our guys' bread and butter. Without the program, insurance will be either unavailable or unaffordable in many regions of the country.\"\nImplementation of reforms to the National Flood Insurance Program also is of interest to the IIABA, he said. Reforms of the debt-ridden program - including a long-term extension of the program - were approved by the previous Congress. Part of the reforms included modernization of flood maps.\n\"As flood maps are modernized, what sort of rate shock does that cause?\" he said. \"Some communities are seeing large rate hikes as much as five times.\"\nImplementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act also presents challenges for independent agents, said Mr. Symington. He noted that the IIABA supports reform of the medical loss ratio provision of the law, which holds that at least 80% of individual and small-group premiums and 85% of large-group premiums collected by the insurer must be spent on claims payments and \"health care quality improvement.\"\nThat means no more than 20% or 15% may go toward \"nonclaims costs,\" such as profit, advertising and administrative costs. An insurer that does not meet these ratios must issue rebates to consumers. Although the law does not specifically address how to classify independent agent compensation under the MLR formula, the regulatory process included agent compensation as a part of the \"nonclaims costs\" category.\nDespite the group's concern about the MLR issue, Mr. Symington said right now, the IIABA is focused on how the state insurance exchanges will operate and affect agents.\n\"We are very active with working with the Health and Human Services Department in D.C. and individual states on implementation of the Affordable Care Act,\" he said.\nThere are \"lots of concerns there will be bumps in the roads\" as the exchanges are created. Open enrollment began Oct. 1.\nHe said IIABA is focused on the navigator program, where companies and nonprofit organizations will help consumers fill out application forms and answer questions about the exchanges.\n\"Our cause for concern with navigators is they're going to be advising consumers entering the new marketplaces,\" which is \"very confusing,\" he said. The navigators need to be properly overseen by regulators at the state level and also be subject to some of the financial responsibility requirements to which agents and brokers are subject, Mr. Symington said.\n\"It's a consumer protection concern,\" he said. \"It's about the exchange creation and our agents' participation in those exchanges.\"\n\nLoad-Date: October 10, 2013"
