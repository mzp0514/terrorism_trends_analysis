    "full text": "RSEC:             The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has reached its most dangerous point in years, veteran Mideast analysts agreed after the past week of bloodshed.\n     But there was no consensus Monday about whether the cycle of violence could best be ended by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, President Bush or divine intervention.\n     - It's all about terrorism, said David Roet, Israel's deputy consul in Chicago. As the world understands since Sept. 11, you don't negotiate with terrorists, you eradicate them, he said.\n   - It's all about injustice, said Heidi Shoup of the Center for Policy Analysis on Palestine.      After decades of occupation, the Palestinians are desperate, she said.\n      The only way out is for international troops to force a cease-fire and negotiations, she said.\n     - It's about provocation, said Caesar Farah of the University of Minnesota. Sharon doesn't want to negotiate, so he provokes the Palestinians, then blames them for attacking. The way out is for the United States to force Israel to skip a round of retaliation, he said.\n     - That won't happen while the United States is at war against terrorism and Israel is fighting terrorist organizations, said Michael Barnett of the University of Wisconsin. With all paths to a two-state solution discredited, he said, Israelis are thinking about formerly unthinkable solutions, such as forcibly expelling the Palestinians.\n     - There's no way out of the downward spiral as long as Sharon and Arafat are the leaders, said Martin Sampson of the University of Minnesota. Israel may turn to leaders who understand that it needs a two-state solution as much as the Palestinians do.\nArafat not targeted\n     Israel wasn't trying to kill Arafat with Monday's attacks, said Roet of the Israeli consulate in Chicago.\n     But the Israeli government is about out of hope that Arafat will deliver the safety that Israel craves. \"Either he is unable or he is unwilling,\" Roet said.\n     Roet said he is well aware of the frequent warnings that whoever would replace Arafat would be more militant.\n     \"It may be that we are entering a period in which we do not have a negotiating partner,\" he said. If so, that period won't last forever. But Israel will not tolerate terrorist attacks nor excuse Arafat's half-hearted efforts to stop them, he said.\n     The issue is terrorism, Roet said, not which side is right or wrong, nor who offered what at Camp David last year.\nDesperate acts\n     Arafat has been making extraordinary efforts to calm the situation, said Shoup, of the Washington-based think tank on Palestine. But Palestinians are \"fed up and desperate.\"\n     Seventy percent of Palestinians in the occupied territories live below the international poverty line. Ten years ago, the Oslo agreement promised deliverance from decades of occupation. Instead, they've seen Israel make agreements and ignore them, seen \"closures that have strangled them . . . and they've lost hope of it getting better any time soon,\" she said.     People living under occupation have a right to resist, but Sharon declares that any opposition to the occupation is terrorism, she said.\n     The only hope is international troops to keep the peace, Shoup said. Otherwise \"the downward spiral just continues.\"\n'Take a miracle'\n     Sharon hopes to never start negotiations to avoid making concessions he doesn't want to make, said Farah of the University of Minnesota. Sharon is trying \"to get Arafat to launch a civil war, so Palestinians will kill Palestinians and wipe out any vestige of the Oslo accords,\" Farah said. But Arafat is \"too smart for that.\"\n     Only Bush can pressure Sharon, but Bush is too pro-Israeli to do that, Farah said. The Arab states have lost confidence in Bush as a mediator and cannot stand by while Israelis kill Palestinians, he said. \"There's going to be war eventually, a much more serious war than this one,\" Farah said. \"It will take a miracle from above to avoid it.\"\nLose-lose position\n     Arafat is in a box, said the University of Wisconsin's Barnett. To avoid a war with Israel that he can't win, he has to make war on Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which he may lose anyway.\n     Arafat is pleading for the United States to pressure Sharon to restart negotiations. Washington says it would like to see negotiations, but it won't tolerate terrorism. The two issues are separate, Barnett said. When Bush included Hamas and Islamic Jihad on the U.S. list of terrorist organizations, he gave Sharon permission to take strong action as long as it could be portrayed as action against those groups.\n     Barnett said he thinks both sides have lost confidence in the possibility of a two-state solution. Negotiations are beyond reach, and the status quo involves violence at levels unacceptable for either side, he said. So he thinks other solutions, including the possibility of forcibly expelling the Palestinians, have become more thinkable among Israelis.\nMistrust\n     Both Arafat and Sharon have \"used up their political potential for reaching a settlement,\" said Sampson of the University of Minnesota. Each is mistrusted by the other side, and neither is completely trusted by their own side.\n     The best hope for peace lies in changing the attitudes of the Israeli electorate and the high birth rate of Palestinians, he said. According to CIA data, the population now under Israeli control is 52 percent Jewish and 48 percent non-Jewish. Soon, Israel and the occupied territories will have an Arab majority, but only a small portion of those Arabs will have political rights.\n     For many years, Israelis thought they could get a peace settlement by trading most of the land won in the 1967 war, and that they could do it on their own terms because control of the territory gave them most of the leverage. But the failure of last year's peace talks and the changing demographics have led a growing number of Israelis to the conclusion that \"Israel can't hold all those territories, have a state with a Jewish majority and have a democratic form of government,\" Sampson said.\n     This realization, he said, has the potential to create an Israeli majority that believes it needs a two-state solution as much as the Palestinians do.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO\n\nLoad-Date: December 4, 2001"
