    "full text": "Oct. 8--The City Council is set to give the green light to a special ordinance that will clear the way for the city's Homeland Security Team to tap into a federal funding pipeline.\nThe first installment promises $85,000 if the council will first front the costs while the federal dollars roll through the State Emergency Management Agency. The team is planning on another $150,000 in federal money for more equipment and training eventually.\nThe offer is just too good for the council to resist. And the truth is that the city will be basically collecting on its fair share of the federal Homeland Security spending. If St. Joseph passes on this deal, some other team will get the money.\nOur complaint has always been that the Northwest Missouri Region H Hazardous Materials Team already operates out of St. Joseph. Officials with the city's new Homeland Security Team promise to not \"reinvent the wheel\" with the federal money.\nOur worry is that taxpayers will be buying a fifth wheel. While the established team focuses on hazardous materials, the city's team will respond to weapons of mass destruction and urban search and rescues.\nThere's more. The feds also are ready to fund new variations on the teams in Rock Port, Chillicothe and Bethany. Each team will be assigned to a unique mission. Rock Port, for example, will specialize as a radiological team because of potential incidents from the Cooper Nuclear Power Station in Brownville, Neb. That adds up to five teams to cover roughly 15 counties in Northwest Missouri.\nWe have pointed out in the past that sparsely populated Northwest Missouri is probably a low priority for most Islamic extremists looking for a prime terror target. Apparently, our lawmakers are happy with a program that distributes the federal pork fairly if not prudently.\nWe also have warned that taxpayers will get upset at the prospect of funding what amounts to competing (they call it cooperating) teams in the same city. We have seen no revolt so far, however. We still think it is important that everyone remember that your tax dollars fill this funding pie.\nOur main worry now is whether Northwest Missouri can come up with enough missions so that every community can get a share of the federal funding pie. We've come up with some suggestions to help. The San Antonio Homeland Security Team can brace for political assassination teams. The team from Siloam Springs can specialize on espionage aimed at our water supply. It's just taxpayers' money.\nCopyright (c) 2006, St. Joseph News-Press, Mo.
