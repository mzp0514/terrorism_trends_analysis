    "full text": "Joe Biden has spent  47 years in office and, in my opinion, accomplished nothing except to enrich himself and his family while his masters oversaw the destruction of the American dream for the middle class. \nBiden watched millions of good U.S. manufacturing jobs moved offshore. The bulk of the jobs left in the new economy were low-paying retail jobs or high-tech jobs requiring computer science skills. Blue-collar jobs would not be coming back, they said. \nBiden and President Obama claimed to reform our health care system, but Obamacare did nothing to improve health care; it was insurance reform. Low-wage earners gained access to insurance through Medicaid plans, but many middle-class Americans ended up with higher premiums. Companies started requiring employees to pay part of the higher costs. Biden claims that if elected, he'll work to reduce premiums. Go figure. \nThe Obama/Biden/John Kerry nuclear deal with Iran, the main supporter of terrorism, returned more than  $50 billion to Iran and gave Iran a path to making its own nukes for practically nothing. Trump, after only 3Â½ years, has created a Middle East peace plan that could end the constant wars. \nThe first coronavirus case in the U.S. was reported Jan. 22. Trump placed restrictions on travel from China on  Jan. 31. Biden immediately called Trump a xenophobe and accused him of fearmongering. \nDemocrat-controlled cities are being reduced to chaos by rampaging Democrat-supported Black Lives Matter and antifa protesters. Few Democrats have condemned the destruction. Biden's recent statement that \"rioting is not  protesting\" is pathetic. \nBob Jacobs \nUnity \n\nLoad-Date: September 26, 2020"
