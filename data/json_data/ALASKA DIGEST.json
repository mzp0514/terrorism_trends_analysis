Mark Begich and Lisa Murkowski would also require the Air Force to have the same number of F-16s or more at Eielson this September, when fiscal year 2013 starts. \n The senators, along with Rep. Don Young, plan to discuss the transfer with Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Norton Schwartz at a Thursday meeting. \n -- Associated Press\n FAIRBANKS\n North Pole man is  accused of extortion \n Alaska authorities say a 36-year-old North Pole man is accused of trying to extort money from the state of Alaska in exchange for not committing acts of terrorism. \n Troopers say Stanislaus Grzeskowiak was arrested Friday after he contacted troopers in Fairbanks and tried to extort $85,000 for committing acts he believed would affect the University of Alaska, oil companies, cellphone companies, credit card companies and troopers' ability to conduct day-to-day operations. \n Court records show he is charged with extortion and threatening harm. \n He is in custody at the Fairbanks Correctional Center, which says he is being held on $2,500 bail and can only be released to a court-approved third party custodian. \n It's unclear if he has an attorney. \n -- Associated Press  \n\nLoad-Date: February 8, 2012"
