Training began in Bartow last week.\n\"These types of courses have become more requested since 9-11,\" Morgan said. \"It shows what to look for and what to watch for.\n\"The emphasis is on how to respond. They are given lifelike scenarios and have to work out the solutions,\" he said. \"It's not preventive. They must be aware that the call they go on tomorrow could be a terrorist attack.\"\nMore than 60 people are expected to participate in the four-day training sessions this month in Plant City, Shuler said.\nThe courses were developed by the National Fire Academy in Maryland.\nThe first course - \"Emergency Response to Terrorism: Basic Concepts\" - will be held Tuesday and Wednesday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Planteen Recreation Center, 301 N. Dort St.\nThe course, designed for fire rescue and emergency medical service personnel, focuses on the history and types of terrorism, terrorist organizations in the United States and abroad, self-protection measures, crime scene and perimeter control and other defense tactical operations.\nA second course - \"Emergency Response to Terrorism: Tactical Considerations for the Company Officer\" - is designed for supervisors. The participants will be trained in security considerations, identifying signs of terrorism, anticipation of unusual circumstances and other assessment actions that should be done in a terrorist attack. That course is 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. May 12-13 at Plant City Stadium, 1904 S. Park Road.\nPlant City Fire Chief George Shiley said the department has never undergone that type of comprehensive training.\nSoon after the terrorist attacks, firefighters here were told to be more aware of their surroundings. In addition, the department offered a general terrorism self-study course for firefighters.\n\"Since 9-11 there have been individual trainings in specific areas,\" Shiley said. \"The police have had some individual sessions. This is just very structured.\n\"It's the same basic information for personnel across the country,\" he said. \"We'd like to think that we would be of some assistance if there was an event in Tampa.\"\n\nLoad-Date: May 5, 2003"
