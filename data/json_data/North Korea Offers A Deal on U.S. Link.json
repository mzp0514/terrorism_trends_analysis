The State Department called the meeting \"productive\" but did not disclose details.\nNorth Korea was put on the list of terrorism sponsors because of its suspected involvement in the bombing of a South Korean airliner in the skies near Myanmar, the former Burma, in 1987. All 115 people aboard the Korean Air plane died.\nMr. Kim's comments on ties with the United States came last week during a meeting with South Korean news executives, Yonhap reported. Mr. Kim invited the executives after meeting the South Korean president, Kim Dae Jung, in Pyongyang in June -- the first summit meeting between leaders of the two Koreas.      \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: August 14, 2000"
