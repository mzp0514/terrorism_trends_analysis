    "full text": "Standing with Israel in the face of terror, President Clinton today pledged at least $100 million to combat Middle East terrorism and promised stronger security ties with the Jewish state.\n\"Can we create a risk-free world here in Israel? No,\" Clinton said in a joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres.\n\"Can we reduce the risks and do much better? Yes.\"\nClinton and Peres met one day after they joined other world leaders in an unprecedented Red Sea summit against terrorism. \"\nClinton hoped to fashion a counter-terrorism accord with Israel by the end of the week and begin work on a defense pact for Peres' visit to Washington in April.\nThe $100 million pledge would pay for a host of anti-terrorism initiatives, including training, bomb-detection scanners, X-ray systems and robotics for handling suspect packages.\nBolstered by the Egyptian summit that brought Israelis and Arabs together with other world leaders, Clinton said, \"The sources that support peace and security are stronger than those that seek destruction.\"\nBut he conceded that presidents, prime ministers, princes and all the politicians in the world can only do so much. Open societies are victims of terrorism, Clinton said, citing the Oklahoma City bombing and poison gas attacks in Japanese subways.\n\"There is no guarantee here,\" Clinton said. \"There are no guarantees in life.\"\nClinton became emotional when a reporter asked whether world leaders can stop suicide bombers.\n\"I wish I had it in my power to reach into the hearts of those young men who have bought some apocalyptic version of Islam and politics that together causes them to strap their bodies with bombs and blow themselves to smithereens and kill innocent children,\" the president said.\n\nLoad-Date: December 9, 1996"
