    "full text": "Here in Wisconsin, a task force report released Nov. 13 recommends 31 steps to better prepare Wisconsin for a terrorist attack.\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services says Wisconsin and Hawaii are the only two states unprepared to deliver medicine and vaccines in the event of a bioterrorism strike. Wisconsin officials have disputed the report.\nThe officials say new recommendations are meant to provide guidance to local and state officials for the terrorism preparation that remains. Ed Gleason, director of Wisconsin Emergency Management, said the governor's office can accomplish many of the group's recommendations, while other suggestions will require legislation.\n\"Hopefully, the new administration will be able to look at these things and this will be a blueprint for them,\" Gleason said.\nGleason and Health and Family Services Secretary Phyllis Dube presented the report to members of a special legislative committee looking at the public health system's response to terrorism and other emergencies.\nCommittee members plan to send incoming Gov. Jim Doyle a letter asking him to continue the terrorism task force after he takes office and to implement a standardized method for managing and deploying resources during an emergency.\nOutgoing Gov. Scott McCallum created the task force in October 2001 to act as a clearinghouse of experts and information on the state's terrorism defenses.\n \n Recommendations\nThe main recommendations of the Task Force on Terrorism Preparedness:\n* Create a regional trauma system to increase the capacity to treat multiple victims in the event of a terrorist attack.\n* Use technology on state driver's licenses that can be read by a machine so law enforcement personnel can better identify people.\n* Prevent information that could jeopardize public safety from being released under the state's open records law.\n* Ensure that health-care providers know how to identify smallpox, anthrax and other infections that could result from terrorism.\n* Modify the state's interim plan for preparing and responding to bioterrorism attacks to reflect a regional response.\n* Incorporate security concepts into new state buildings or those undergoing renovation to reduce the likelihood of a crime or terrorist incident.\n* Assess water supplies to determine vulnerability to attack and explore technology to make recommendations for improving water testing.\n* Stockpile potassium iodide in the vicinity of Wisconsin's nuclear power plants as an additional protective measure to evacuations and sheltering for residents in case of an emergency.\n* On the Internet: Task Force on Terrorism Preparedness: www.wisconsin.gov/state/core/domestic-prep.html \n\nLoad-Date: November 26, 2002"
