    "full text": "A federal judge ordered Iran to pay $ 247.5 million in damages to the family of an American woman killed in a suicide bombing in Gaza in 1995. \"The court is seeking to deter further terrorist actions,\" said District Court Judge Royce Lamberth.\nThe ruling Wednesday was the first under a new law allowing Americans to sue nations believed to sponsor terrorism for damages caused by such attacks. While the victim's family is unlikely to collect the damage award any time soon, the ruling could complicate efforts to improve relations between the United States and Iran.\n\"Terrorists and the countries which sponsor them should know that we will continue to increase the price to be paid for acts of terrorism,\" declared Rep. Jim Saxton, R-N.J., who heads the House Task Force on Terrorism. \"This decision clearly shows that we will . . . hit them hard in the wallet as well.\"\nIran vehemently denies it has any connections to terrorist groups or attacks. Although Lamberth said Iranian representatives had been invited to testify at court hearings on March 3-4, a spokesman for the Iranian mission to the United Nations said Wednesday that he was unaware of the court case in Washington.\nThe two countries have been bitter foes since the 1979 ouster of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi and the taking of U.S. hostages. But since the election last year of a moderate cleric as president of Iran, signs have been seen of a possible thaw and re-establishment of cultural and other ties.\nThe ruling Wednesday, made under the Antiterrorism Act of 1996, would award the money to the family of Alisa Flatow, 20, of West Orange, N.J. Flatow was a student at a seminary in Jerusalem when she and seven Israeli solders were killed in an attack on a bus in Gaza City on April 9, 1995. Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility.\nThe judge agreed with the Flatow family that Islamic Jihad is backed by Iran's Islamic government and that Iran therefore is responsible for her death.\n\"The lunatics who planted the bomb and drove the van that killed Alisa were not acting alone,\" said Stephen Flatlow, the student's father. \"A state sponsor of terrorism such as the Islamic Republic of Iran has to be held to account.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO, Photo from THE ASSOCIATED PRESS - Sen.
