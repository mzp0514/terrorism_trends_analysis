Terrorism tries to divide the nation, we can't be divided by any power. The entire opposition is with security forces and the government,\" Gandhi said.\n\"Those who have done this should not feel that they can harm the country. It is a time of mourning and sadness,\" he added.\nSingh said the nation can never compromise with terrorism.\n\"Terrorism is a scourge which we can never compromise...,\" the former prime minister said.\nOn Thursday, an explosives laden truck rammed into a CRPF convoy in Pulwama outside Srinagar, killing 37 soldiers in one of the biggest terror attacks in recent years.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MetroVaartha English.
