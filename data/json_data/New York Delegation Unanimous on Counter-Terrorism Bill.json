    "full text": "NEW YORK AID Following on the heels of the House, the Senate yesterday gave final approval to an emergency supplemental spending bill that provides $5.5 billion for New York City rebuilding.\nSenator Clinton and Senator Schumer joined the majority in a 92-7 vote in favor of the $28.9 billion bill that also pays for a variety of anti-terrorism efforts, such as the fight in Afghanistan and homeland security.\nThe money for New York includes $2.66 billion for Federal Emergency Management Agency emergency response and debris removal; $1.8 billion for a transit facility to connect PATH trains subway lines running through Lower Manhattan; and $750 million for utility reconstruction.\nMrs. Clinton's $90 million for health care screenings of emergency and recovery workers remains in the bill, despite the objections of the Bush administration.\nThe Bush administration called the original $31 billion Senate legislation too costly - it had singled out the $90 million health care screening, among other expenditures - and threatened a veto, but the bill is close to the price range limits the Office of Management and Budget had set.\nEvery member of New York City's House delegation voted in favor of the bill Monday.\n\" P ARTIAL BIRTH \" ABORTION SPLIT\nThe House yesterday passed a bill to ban \"partial birth\" abortions, with all but two lawmakers in the New York City delegation voting against the legislation.\nRep. Vito Fossella, a Republican, and Rep. Joseph Crowley, a Democrat, voted with the 272-member majority that approved the bill.\nUnder the legislation, a doctor could only perform the procedure if a mother's life is threatened.\nThe measure has passed both the House and Senate in recent sessions, but there are few indications the Senate will take up the legislation before the end of the year.\nVoting against the ban, all Democrats: Reps. Gary Ackerman; Eliot Engel; Nita Lowey; Carolyn Maloney; Gregory Meeks; Jerrold Nadler; Major Owens; Charles Rangel; Jose Serrano; Edolphus Towns; Nydia Velazquez; and Anthony Weiner.\n\nLoad-Date: December 3, 2003"
