    "full text": "As President Bush mulls what to do after winning re-election, voters say his first priority should be resolving the situation in Iraq, where the fighting is growing more intense.\n They also want Bush to cut the deficit, which ballooned under his watch, rather than pushing for more tax cuts, according to an Associated Press poll taken right after the election.\n The voters' concerns stood in contrast to the priorities Bush cited after he defeated Democrat John F. Kerry. Bush pledged to aggressively pursue major changes in Social Security, tax laws and medical malpractice awards. Terrorism was a chief concern both for Bush and many voters in the poll.\n\"I earned capital in the campaign, political capital, and now I intend to spend it,\" Bush said a day after becoming the first president in 68 years to win re-election and gain seats in both the House and Senate.\n Some 27 percent of respondents named Iraq as the top priority for the president's second term, ahead of issues such as terrorism, the economy and health care.\n Only 2 percent named taxes as a priority. By more than a 2-1 margin, voters said they preferred that the president balance the budget rather than cut taxes further.\n After a campaign dominated by discussion of Iraq and terrorism, national security issues are at the top of voters' concerns along with the economy. Voters were asked to pick from a list of issues in the AP poll that included Iraq, terrorism, the economy, unemployment, health care, education and taxes.\n Many voters on Election Day indicated they were also concerned about \"moral values\" -- a broader concern than specific issues such as health care and education.\n Republicans ranked terrorism first on the list, followed by Iraq and the economy as priorities for Bush. Democrats were most likely to name Iraq, followed by the economy and health care while independents picked Iraq and then terrorism, according to the poll conducted for the AP by Ipsos-Public Affairs.\n \"He has to go 500 percent in Iraq,\" said Ruth Shoemaker, an independent and a retiree from Chula Vista, Calif. \"That's why I voted for the president.\"\n Seven in 10 voters, including a majority of Democrats, would prefer that U.S. troops stay in Iraq until the country is stable, instead of having them leave immediately. U.S. troops are preparing for assaults on insurgent strongholds used as havens for those mounting increased attacks against coalition forces.\n \"There has got to be some kind of resolution in Iraq,\" said Erwin Neighbors, a Republican and a community college teacher from Moberly, Mo.  \"We can't fold our tent without accomplishing our goals.\"\n Given the choice between balancing the budget and cutting taxes, voters chose balancing the budget by 66 percent to 31 percent. Just over half of Republicans as well as most Democrats and independents felt that way.\n The AP-Ipsos poll of 844 registered voters was taken Nov. 3-5 and has a margin of sampling error of 3.5 percentage points.\n\nLoad-Date: November 9, 2004"
