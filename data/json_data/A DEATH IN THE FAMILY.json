Now, another New Yorker has joined the ranks of the fallen.\nLance Cpl. Jabari Thompson of Brooklyn, just 22 years old, died Sunday after stepping on an improvised explosive device while on patrol in Helmand Province on July 13.\nBorn in Florida, Thompson moved to the city when he was 12 to live with an aunt after his mother died. He graduated from South Shore High School and asked a Brooklyn girl, Shamiah Lewis, to marry him. But while New York was his home, the Marines were his life. Being in the corps, he told his family, made him a man.\nThompson enlisted in January 2008, shortly after graduation, and trained as a machine gunner. He served in Haiti with the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine Expeditionary Force from January to April 2010. In February, he was sent to Afghanistan.\nDuring his short career, he earned a chest full of medals: the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and Global War on Terrorism Service Medal.\n\"Death is nothing,\" Thompson wrote to his cousin. \"It's about the mission.\"\nHe, his fianc√©e and his family have something even more important than medals now: The gratitude and prayers of his comrades in the field of battle, and of the city that was his home.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n[Lance Cpl. Jabari Thompson]\n\nLoad-Date: July 21, 2011"
