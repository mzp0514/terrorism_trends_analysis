    "full text": "''Path of Blood'' gives a director credit to Jonathan Hacker, who wrote a 2015 book of the same title with Thomas Small. But directing isn't quite accurate. This documentary, which covers events in Saudi Arabia from 2003 to 2009, interweaves videos made by Al Qaeda members there with footage shot by Saudi security forces of raids on terrorist suspects' safe houses.\nThe amateur recordings are not principally finished propaganda; they're more like outtakes, replete with directions from off camera and flubbed dialogue. Much of ''Path of Blood'' makes these extremists, who sought to destabilize Saudi Arabia, look inept. Late in the movie, as cell members drive to a planned attack, one car runs low on gas. (''Is it completely empty or is there a bit left?'' one man radios another, who asks if he has money for a refill.) \n  The film does not make light of the circumstances, though, nor does it suggest that disorganized terrorism is without danger. Mr. Hacker includes viscerally disturbing excerpts showing Paul Marshall Johnson Jr., an American engineer, being held hostage and questioned by Islamic militants who ultimately execute him -- a killing not shown on screen.\n  Watching ''Path of Blood'' is frequently a queasy experience, and given the bewildering array of names and complications, not always an illuminating one. But it commands attention as an object lesson in the banality of evil.\n  Not rated. In Arabic and English, with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 32 minutes.        \n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/12/movies/path-of-blood-review-al-qaeda-vs-saudis.html\n\nLoad-Date: July 13, 2018"
