    "full text": "- FBI agents on Thursday searched the California home belonging to a family member of the husband-and-wife killers who massacred 14 people in the San Bernardino terror attack, but the relative was not arrested and has not been named a suspect.\nSyed Rizwan Farook's brother, Syed Raheel Farook, is a military veteran who earned medals for fighting global terrorism. The search warrant is sealed, and FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller would not disclose any information other than to confirm a search was conducted at a home in Corona. \nTo serve a search warrant, authorities must have probable cause a crime was committed and items connected to the crime are likely to be found at the location. Stacy Mozer, who lives near the home, said he watched agents carry away armloads of boxes filled with manila envelopes, a computer tower and stacks of paper. At least a dozen agents were present.He described Raheel Farook and wife Tatiana as ideal neighbors.\nI would find it very hard to believe that they would be involved in any way, he said. I do know that if you have a family member, you don't have control of their lives, and I don't think they had control of their brother's life. \nMozer said the family's home was searched twice after the December shooting, and authorities once broke down the door. \nSyed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire Dec. 2 at a meeting of his San Bernardino County co-workers. They died hours later in a shootout with police. The 14 people killed marked the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2001. \nRaheel Farook was a Navy information system technician from 2003 to 2007. He was stationed aboard the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise and received the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, among other awards. \n\nLoad-Date: February 19, 2016"
