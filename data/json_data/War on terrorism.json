How would we portray it as ''defense\" if we are\n not immediately responding to a direct threat?\n Answer: There are a lot of potential scenarios as the war on terrorism\n begins to focus outside of Afghanistan, according to Lt. Col. Dave Lapan, a\n Department of Defense spokesman at the Pentagon. Financial, diplomatic and\n police actions already have taken place in other countries around the world.\nThe ways in which military force might be used against terrorists depends upon\n the country.\n ''Pakistan, for instance, has supported the war on terrorism,\" said Lapan.\n ''Using that as an example, we would rely on the government of Pakistan to go\n after the terrorists.\"\n What about other countries that don't police terrorists? ''President Bush\n has said that we're taking the fight to the terrorists, wherever they are,\"\n Lapan said.\n After Sept. 11, the Bush administration considers such action against\n terrorists to be in self-defense. ''Countries that haven't gotten the message\n or don't want to take action to root out terrorism in their midst are taking a\n big risk,\" Lapan said.\n Q: We've heard of ''at least a couple of dozen\" civilians killed or\n wounded in Afghanistan. What is a valid count of civilians caught in the\n bombing?\n A: ''There's no way of telling,\" said Lt. Col. Lapan. ''We've done\n everything we can to minimize this, and we acknowledge there have been errors\n in which civilians have been killed, but we have no way of knowing how many.\"\n Q: For the past couple of months, only the first names of military\n personnel stationed overseas in and around Afghanistan were used. Now, all of\n the sudden, both the first and last names are used. What's the reason?\n A: Different branches of the military follow different guidelines,\n according to Lt. David Faggard, Fairchild Air Force Base spokesman.\n The Air Force still strictly follows the policy of using only first names\n and ranks for personnel interviewed by news organizations. Many of the locally\n produced stories that you've read in The SpokesmanReview about people\n stationed overseas involved Air Force personnel, and therefore listed first\n names only.\n Faggard said that other branches of the military, the Marines in\n particular, don't always follow that protocol, and that's why you've seen\n military personnel identified by both first and last names, primarily in\n stories produced by national or international news organizations.\n Faggard said the first-name-only policy is intended to protect the families\n of military personnel from potential retribution from anti-American terrorists\n who might scan the media for potential targets.\nIf you have a question, submit it by e-mail to JimC@spokesman.com, or by  \n fax to (509) 459-5482, or by regular mail to Jim Camden, c/o The\n Spokesman-Review, P.O. Box 2160, Spokane WA, 99210.\n\nLoad-Date: December 25, 2001"
