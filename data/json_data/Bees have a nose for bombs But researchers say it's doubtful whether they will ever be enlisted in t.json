The bees even underwent field trials, successfully sniffing out explosives in a simulated roadside bomb, in a vehicle, and on a person rigged like a suicide bomber.\nThe insects have a phenomenal sense of smell, rivaling that of dogs, Haarmann said.\nThe researchers found that ordinary honeybees can readily be trained by being exposed to the odor of an explosive, then given sugar water as a reward. After a few times, the bee, anticipating the sugar water, will stick out its tongue at the smell of the explosive.\nThe study was funded by the Department of Defense's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.\nDespite the positive test results, the agency said it does not see a future for bomb-detecting bees in the military.\n\"Bees are not reliable enough for military tactical use at this point,\" the agency said in a statement this week. \"We see no clear pathway to make them reliable enough to make it worth risking the lives of our service men and women.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO\nPHOTO - A honeybee receives a sugar water reward during tests at the lab.
