    "full text": "WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama is promising to reinvigorate the Freedom of Information Act by opening more of the government's filing cabinets without a fight. It can't happen soon enough for the people awaiting replies to more than 150,000 requests for information.\nThe delays in answering requests affect ordinary citizens, lawyers handling cases, even corporations, but journalists are also among the regular users.\nObama has begun to deliver, but there are conflicting signs about how far he will go.\nOn his first day as president, Obama told all federal agencies to adopt a presumption of disclosure — reversing the Bush administration policy of defending any legitimate excuse to withhold information.\nThis month, the Justice Department released nine legal opinions the Bush administration had used to justify its tactics in fighting terrorism but had withheld from the public. But three dozen more Bush-era legal memos about anti-terrorism tactics are still kept secret, the subjects of lawsuits by private organizations trying to obtain them.\nThe Justice Department is writing new guidelines to flesh out Obama's policy. The act has required the government to keep secret records that might harm national security, disclose the identity of law enforcement informants, compromise a criminal investigation or reveal corporations' trade secrets. The act also gives agencies discretion to withhold other materials, including records about internal policies the agencies consider trivial.\n\nLoad-Date: March 18, 2009"
