    "full text": "Supporters of Senator John McCain have been accusing Senator Barack Obama of having a pre-Sept. 11 mind-set in his approach to national security. On Wednesday, Mr. Obama fired back by linking Mr. McCain and President Bush and calling them weak on terrorism.\n  ''Their approach has failed,'' Mr. Obama said after the first meeting of his newly formed national security working group, according to a pool report. ''Because of their policies, we are less safe, less respected and less able to lead the world. It's time to turn the page.''\n  Mr. Obama made his accusations  while surrounded by foreign policy heavyweights from previous administrations and Congress. Members of the news media were permitted to hear only Mr. Obama's opening and closing statements to the group; the discussion was closed.\n  The group has 13 members, including two former secretaries of state, Madeleine K. Albright and Warren Christopher, former Secretary of Defense William J. Perry and Anthony Lake, a former national security adviser. Others  are former  Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia; Greg Craig, former director of the State Department Office of Policy Planning; former Representative Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana, former chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee; and former Representative Tim Roemer of Indiana, a member of the Sept. 11 commission.\n  Bill Burton, a spokesman for the campaign, said Mr. Obama would meet regularly with the advisory group between now and the election.
