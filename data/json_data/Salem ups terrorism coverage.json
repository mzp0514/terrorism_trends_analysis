(AP) Salem's status as the state capital has prompted the city council to purchase additional terrorism insurance, which would cover up to $ 60 million in property damage if there is a terrorism attack.\nThe city council has approved spending $ 10,000 on a limited coverage plan. The city's current standard policy now covers $ 100,000 in damages.\n\"Local law enforcement agencies believe that Salem's exposure is as great, or greater, than that of other Oregon cities,\" according to a staff report. \"Recent bomb threats, as well as the discovery of explosive devices on city property, appear to confirm this belief.\"\nIn February, two pipe bombs were found under new police cars in a shop area. In June 2002, a 4-month-old pipe bomb was found along Interstate 5, and a month later a pipe bomb was found in the back of a car parked at a towing company.\nThe city has also seen a number of false alarms. On May 8, the Vern Miller Civic Center was evacuated after police received a bomb threat and found a suspicious package in the center's atrium.\nIn September, an anthrax hoax shut down the state Capitol.\nSalem risk manager Sharee Emmons said she proposed the insurance because an offer was available to extend coverage to all city buildings and the airport. She said there was no immediate threat to Salem, but the potential risk was enough to give it to the council for consideration.\nOther Oregon cities have also purchased terrorism insurance, including Eugene, which recently renewed its terrorism insurance covering as much as $ 100 million in damage to city property.\n\"I felt the (full) insurance was important based on our experiences with demonstrations, riots and property damage,\" said Myrnie Daut, Eugene's risk manager.\n\nLoad-Date: July 14, 2003"
