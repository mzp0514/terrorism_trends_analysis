    "full text": "A Utah man is facing felony commercial terrorism charges after police say he threw away his competitor's tourism brochures.\nScott Eckersley, 38, is charged in 4th District Court with four counts of second-degree felony commercial obstruction.\nWasatch County prosecutor McKay King said the charges fall under Utah's Commercial Terrorism statute, which prohibits people from interfering with business operations or removing merchandise, records or property from a business.\nEckersley, of Midway, has pleaded not guilty to the charges and is expected to make his initial appearance in court on June 24.\nWasatch County Sheriff's Lt. Jeff Winterton said Thursday that the criminal charges stemmed from allegations that Eckersley removed tourism brochures from the Zermatt Resort in Midway and threw them away. This happened four times over the last year, Winterton said.\n\"He reportedly had a competing business himself,\" Winterton said. \"He would remove the brochures out of the competition's rack, toss them away and replace them with his.\"\nCourt records do not detail what business Eckersley was associated with, though state records indicate that Eckersley is the registered agent for the Utah business Park City Local, LLC.\nIf convicted as charged, Eckersley could face a one-to-15 year prison sentence for each charge.\nEckersley's attorney did not return a phone call seeking comment.\nEckersley previously served as a staff attorney in the governor's office in Missouri before he was fired in a high-profile spat that sparked a wrongful termination lawsuit settled in 2009.\nHe ran unsuccessfully for Congress as a Democrat the following year.\nccc The Associated Press contributed to this report.\njmiller@sltrib.com\nTwitter: @jm_miller\n\nLoad-Date: June 13, 2015"
