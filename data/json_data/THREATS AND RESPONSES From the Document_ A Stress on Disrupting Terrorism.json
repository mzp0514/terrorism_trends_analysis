In the 21st century, only nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. People everywhere want to say what they think, choose who will govern them, worship as they please, educate their children -- male and female, own property and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom are right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of freedom-loving people across the globe. . . . \n The events of Sept. 11, 2001, taught us that weak states like Afghanistan can pose as great a danger to our national interests as strong states. Poverty does not make poor people into terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty, weak institutions and corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and drug cartels within their borders.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF AMERICA'S INTERNATIONAL STRATEGY\nWe will: \n\n* Speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to advance freedom;\n* use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who struggle nonviolently for it, ensuring that nations moving toward democracy are rewarded for the steps they take;\n* take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments. . . .\n\nII. STRENGTHEN ALLIANCES TO DEFEAT GLOBAL TERRORISM AND WORK TO PREVENT ATTACKS AGAINST US AND OUR FRIENDS\n. . . Our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations of global reach and attack their leadership; command, control, and communications; material support; and finances. This will have a disabling effect upon the terrorists' ability to plan and operate.\nWe will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by:\n\n* direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and international power. Our immediate focus will be those terrorist organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction (W.M.D.) or their precursors;\n* defending the United States, the American people and our interests at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it reaches our borders. While the United States will constantly strive to enlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by acting pre-emptively; . . . and\n* denying further sponsorship, support and sanctuary to terrorists by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign responsibilities.\nWe will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international terrorism. This includes:\n\n* using the full influence of the United States, and working closely with allies and friends, to make clear that all acts of terrorism are illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as slavery, piracy, or genocide: behavior that no respectable government can condone or support and all must oppose;\n* supporting moderate and modern government, especially in the Muslim world, to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation; . . .\n\nV. PREVENT OUR ENEMIES FROM THREATENING US, OUR ALLIES AND OUR FRIENDS WITH WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION\n. . . Our comprehensive strategy to combat W.M.D. includes:\n\n* Proactive counterproliferation efforts. We must deter and defend against the threat before it is unleashed. . . . Given the goals of rogue states and terrorists, the United States can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have in the past. The inability to deter a potential attacker, the immediacy of today's threats, and the magnitude of potential harm that could be caused by our adversaries' choice of weapons, do not permit that option. . . .\n\nVI. IGNITE A NEW ERA OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH THROUGH FREE MARKETS AND FREE TRADE\n. . . We will use our economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic growth, including:\n\n* pro-growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business investment, innovation and entrepreneurial activity;\n* tax policies, particularly lower marginal tax rates, that improve incentives for work and investment;\n* rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic endeavors. . . .\nBeyond market access, the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public health. We will ensure that the W.T.O. intellectual property rules are flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical medicines for extraordinary dangers like H.I.V./AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.\n\nVII. EXPAND THE CIRCLE OF DEVELOPMENT BY OPENING SOCIETIES AND BUILDING\nTHE INFRASTRUCTURE OF DEMOCRACY\nA world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human race lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable. Including all of the world's poor in an expanding circle of development and opportunity is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of U.S. international policy. . . .\nThe United States Government will . . . provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of national reform. We propose a 50 percent increase in the core development assistance given by the United States. . . .\n\nIX. TRANSFORM AMERICA'S NATIONAL SECURITY INSTITUTIONS TO MEET THE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES OF THE 21ST CENTURY:\n. . . The United States must and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy -- whether a state or nonstate actor -- to impose its will on the United States, our allies, or our friends. We will maintain the forces sufficient to support our obligations, and to defend freedom. Our forces will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a military buildup in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, the power of the United States. . . .\nUltimately, the foundation of American strength is at home. It is in the skills of our people, the dynamism of our economy and the resilience of our institutions. A diverse, modern society has inherent, ambitious, entrepreneurial energy. Our strength comes from what we do with that energy. That is where our national security begins. \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: September 20, 2002"
