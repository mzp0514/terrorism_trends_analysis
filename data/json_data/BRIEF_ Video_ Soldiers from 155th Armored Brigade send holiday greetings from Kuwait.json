Featured in the video are soldiers from Brookhaven, Liberty, Jackson and other areas of the region.\nOperation Spartan Shield is a combined forces contingency operation within Central Command's area of responsibility. One of the most dynamic regions of the world, this area of operation has impact on U.S. vital interests -- specifically the free flow of resources through key shipping lanes, the defense of our homeland against the pervasive and persistent threat of terrorism and extremism, and the prevention of the proliferation of WMD. Operation Spartan Shield plays a role both in deterring regional aggression and reacting to possible threats within the Middle East.\n___ (c)2018 The Natchez Democrat (Natchez, Miss.)
