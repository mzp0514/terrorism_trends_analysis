    "full text": "Seven minutes after the second hijacked plane struck New York's World Trade Center, Steve Bice was on the telephone with the National Security Council.\nBefore the call ended, the director of the CDC's National Pharmaceutical Stockpile had dispatched the first emergency medical supplies to New York. The initial \"push package,\" 50 tons of emergency supplies and medication, reached New York four hours later. A second shipment, flown in from the West Coast, was there by nightfall. And despite the lockdown of the U.S. civilian air traffic system, so were eight stockpile staff from Atlanta.\nAJC\nBut there was a macabre twist to this first test of the nation's life-saving stockpile of medical supplies. So many people died and so few injured survived the collapse of the twin towers that New York's hospitals were able to handle them on their own.\nStill, there were lessons to be learned. \"The events of Sept. 11 showed us that we will need more burn and trauma material in these packages,\" says Bice. \"If the towers hadn't collapsed and the people who died had been survivors, we would have needed a lot more than we had.\"\nThere were other discoveries too, ones that mock emergencies and exercises had failed to anticipate. \"The cellphones we had were pretty useless,\" Bice says. \"In the future, we'll be using other means of communication.\"\nFirst aid during terrorism is not an easy thing to plan, and the discovery of deadly anthrax spores in the mail a few weeks later provided more lessons. Supplies of the antibiotic Cipro were more than adequate for the people who needed treatment, but repackaging bulk quantities and distributing the pills created a logjam.\n\"In the future, every push package is going to have a repackaging machine so we can take bulk supplies and get them ready for distribution quickly,\" says Bice. \"We're also going to be buying more individually packaged drugs.\"\nOver the last three years, exercises to test emergency response capabilities have repeatedly pointed out deficiencies in the distribution of medical supplies as one of the weak spots in terrorism defenses.\nTOPOFF, a mock exercise that included a bioterrorism attack with plague in Denver, found great difficulties in getting antibiotics from the delivery point to the people in need. Denver, as a result, had more than 3,000 mock cases of plague in five days.\n\"Just delivering a stockpile package doesn't solve the problem,\" says Elin Gursky, senior fellow at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies. \"Getting its contents delivered requires an integrated community response plan.\"\nAn exercise called Dark Winter, sponsored by the center last year, simulated a bioterrorist smallpox attack beginning in Oklahoma and spreading to other states. It quickly drained away stocks of vaccine and triggered fierce federal-state feuds over who should get the limited supplies.\nIn December, a federal advisory panel headed by Virginia Gov. James Gilmore pointed out gaps in state and federal agencies' efforts to co-ordinate distribution of medical supplies once they were delivered.\nThe Bush Administration's new budget request, due to be sent to Congress this week, seeks $3.5 billion to equip and train emergency medical personnel and other first responders, $245 million for preparedness drills and $105 million for improving emergency planning.\nThe anthrax episode also exposed what officials say might be another fundamental shortage in the stockpile program: manpower.\nBecause the anthrax scare rippled gradually from Florida to Connecticut over a period of several weeks, the CDC and state health authorities were able, with a major effort, to distribute drugs to 40,000 people.\n\"But it's a good thing it died down when it did,\" Bice says. \"We were getting thin.\"\nThe stockpile staff will double this year, to a force of about 80. Still, Bice is concerned about what might happen the next time.\n\"In retrospect, we were lucky with anthrax this time. I worry about how we would deal with 500 letters with anthrax blossoming in 5,000 places and a million people exposed,\" he says.\n\nLoad-Date: January 29, 2002"
