And she thanked the rally's sponsors, Sherman and Provena St. Joseph hospitals, for helping to educate people about the crimes that injure and kill so many.  \n\"Domestic violence and partner abuse will not be tolerated in our community,\" West said. \"It is a problem that affects us all.\"  \nShowing just how widespread domestic violence is in the Fox Valley and nationwide, crisis center volunteers at Saturday's rally hung up on clotheslines more than 300 T-shirts designed by survivors of domestic violence.  \nAnd for the first time in the rally's history, the crisis center displayed a \"Silent Witness\" exhibit, which shows life-size silhouettes representing 28 women and one man from Chicago and the suburbs who lost their lives to domestic violence.  \nAmong those in the Fox Valley who were recognized in the \"Silent Witness\" display were:  \n- Hristina Vladimirov, 42, of Burlington, strangled in her house in March 2000.  \n- Delma Soto, 24, of Elgin, stabbed in March 1998.  \n- Cathie S. Gostele, 43, of Elgin, stabbed 12 times in November 1995.  \n- Janika Lovelace, 19, of Elgin, shot in the head in September 1994.  \n- Celia Cruz, 48, and her 14-year-old daughter, Rubi Gutierrez, both of Elgin, shot in June 2001.  \n- Blanca Lopez, 42, of Elgin, shot in February 2002.  \n- Tracey Boyer, 28, of Elgin, strangled and stabbed in November 1994.  \n- Joan Bierdz, 37, of Elgin, stabbed in her driveway in August 1999.\n\nLoad-Date: September 23, 2003"
