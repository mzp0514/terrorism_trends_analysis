Patman, professor of international relations at the University of Otago in New Zealand, in a Global Awareness lecture Wednesday, discussed American policy toward Sub-Saharan Africa before and after 9/11.\nSince the Cold War, the U.S. has changed its policy from involvement to retreat to current engagement, Patman said.\nBefore the Cold War, \"Washington essentially treated Africa as a strategic pawn in a game with the Soviet Union,\" Patman said,\nFollowing the Cold War, Patman said there was \"a constructive form of engagement.\"\nWhen 800,000 Somalis were killed in 1993, the U.S. decided to intervene and distribute humanitarian needs by whatever means necessary.\nThis was the first time authority was given to intervene with armed humanitarianism without the consent from either warring party. This, however, Patman said, only met needs on a short-term basis; it did not stabilize the government.\nWhen Clinton came into office, his administration refused to acknowledge the killings as genocide, Patman said.\nClinton planned to pull troops out within six months and proclaimed that the U.S. would keep peace only if it was in the interest of the U.S.\n\"Clinton wanted to dispel the fear of getting involved with other countries that might result in American casualties,\" Patman said. \"Retreat from Africa also retracted democratization.\"\nSecurity threats continued to increase during this period.\nCivil wars were a major international security problem and prompted re-engagement in Africa, Patman said. Bush deployed 1,500 U.S. troops to Africa and boosted defenses after 9/11.\n\"We have a situation where the Bush administration became concerned for the rise of terrorism in Africa,\" he said.\nBush has yet to win support for action toward Africa.\n(C) 2008 The Daily Universe via U-WIRE\n\nLoad-Date: March 27, 2008"
