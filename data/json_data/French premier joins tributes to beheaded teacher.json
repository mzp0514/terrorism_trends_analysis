A moment's silence was observed across the square, broken by applause and a rousing rendition of La Marseillaise, the French national anthem.\nDemonstrators also gathered in major cities including Lyon, Toulouse, Strasbourg, Nantes, Marseille, Lille and Bordeaux.\nFrench authorities, meanwhile, say they have detained an 11th person following the killing.\nAnti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard said an investigation for murder with a suspected terrorist motive was opened. At least four of those detained are family members of the attacker, who had been granted 10-year residency in France as a refugee in March, was armed with a knife and an airsoft gun, which fires plastic pellets.\nHis half-sister joined the Islamic State group in Syria in 2014, Ricard said. He didn't give her name, and it wasn't clear where she is now.\nThe prosecutor said a text claiming responsibility and a photograph of the victim were found on the suspect's phone. He also confirmed that a Twitter account under the name Abdoulakh A belonged to the suspect. It posted a photo of the decapitated head minutes after the attack along with the message \"I have executed one of the dogs from hell who dared to put Muhammad down.\"\nThe beheading has upset moderate French Muslims and a group of imams in the Lyon region are holding a special meeting Sunday to discuss what the group called \"the appalling assassination of our compatriot by a terrorist who in the name of an uncertain faith committed the irreparable.\"\nThe head of the world's largest body of Muslim-majority nations has also condemned the killing. In a statement Sunday by the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the office of the general secretary, Yousef al-Othaimeen, reiterated the OIC's \"well-known position of rejecting all forms of extremism, radicalization and terrorism for any reason or motive.\"\nThe attack has provoked a strong international rebuke. U.S. President Donald Trump addressed the killing Saturday night from a political rally in Janesville, Wisco.\n\"On behalf of the United States, I'd like to extend my really sincere condolences to a friend of mine, President (Emmanuel) Macron of France, where they just yesterday had a vicious, vicious Islamic terrorist attack - beheading an innocent teacher near Paris,\" he said. \"France is having a hard time and Macron's a great guy.\"\n---\nAya Batrawy in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.
