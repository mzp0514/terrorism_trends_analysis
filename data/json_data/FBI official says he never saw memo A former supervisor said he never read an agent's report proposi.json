    "full text": "The former headquarters supervisor of the FBI's international terrorism operations section testified yesterday that he had never read an Aug. 18, 2001, memo in which an agent proposed a full criminal investigation of Zacarias Moussaoui as a possible terrorist hijacker.\nThe supervisor, Michael Rolince, was questioned by defense attorney Edward MacMahon during Moussaoui's sentencing trial. Rolince was asked whether he had ever heard that FBI agent Harry Samit, who arrested Moussaoui while he was taking pilot lessons in Minnesota, concluded that Moussaoui was a terrorist planning to hijack a commercial jet.\n\"No,\" Rolince said.\nHad he heard other conclusions by Samit about Moussaoui?\n\"No. What document are you reading?\" Rolince demanded.\nSamit's Aug. 18 report \"sent to your office,\" MacMahon replied.\nRolince, a 31-year FBI veteran who retired in October, was called as a government witness but proved more valuable for the defense. Moussaoui, 37, a Frenchman of Moroccan descent, faces execution or life in prison for conspiring in the 9/11 plot, though he says he was training rather for a possible second wave of attacks.\nDefense objections and rulings by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema barred Rolince from giving what prosecutors wanted most: a long listing of investigative steps the FBI could have taken had Moussaoui admitted upon his Aug. 16, 2001, arrest all the facts he confessed to when he pleaded guilty last April.\nInstead, MacMahon was able to extract from Rolince more embarrassing revelations about FBI handling of terrorism intelligence before 9/11.\nTo get the death penalty, the government must show that Moussaoui's lies upon his arrest prevented the FBI from identifying 9/11 hijackers and prevented the Federal Aviation Administration from altering airport security enough to have saved at least one of the nearly 3,000 people who died on Sept. 11.\nThe defense contends that the government knew more than Moussaoui did about 9/11 before it happened and that the FBI was so inept at fighting terrorism that nothing Moussaoui could have told them would have mattered.\nRolince was able to say only that Moussaoui's confession statements were more specific about al-Qaeda's targets and methods than other terrorist-threat reports the government had before 9/11 and that the FBI could - not necessarily would - have used all 11,300 agents to track leads and Moussaoui's financing.\nEarlier yesterday, jurors saw videotaped testimony in which a Saudi-born Yemeni citizen, Hussein al-Attas, said Moussaoui talked about holy war every day for the month and a half they roomed together in 2001 in Oklahoma and Minnesota.\n\nLoad-Date: March 22, 2006"
