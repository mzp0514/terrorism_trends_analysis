    "full text": "SARGODHA, Pakistan - Five Americans detained in Pakistan told a court Monday they intended to cross the border into Afghanistan to wage jihad against Western forces but denied any links to al-Qaida or plans to carry out terrorist attacks in Pakistan. The admission could be a prelude to possible U.S. conspiracy charges but might also draw sympathy from an increasingly anti-American Pakistani public. \nSuch feelings have complicated U.S. efforts to persuade Pakistan to do more to crack down on militants carrying out cross-border attacks on coalition troops in Afghanistan. \"We are not terrorists,\" one of the five men, Ramy Zamzam, said as he entered the courtroom in the eastern Pakistani city of Sargodha, where they were arrested in December. \"We are jihadists, and jihad is not terrorism,\" said Zamzam, a 22-year-old Egyptian American who was a dental student at Howard University in Washington, D.C. Jihad has several different meanings in Islam, but Zamzam seemed to be referring to the duty to fight against foreign forces viewed as occupying a Muslim country. Zamzam and another member of the group, Ethiopian American Ahmed Minni, insisted the men had no links with al-Qaida and were focused only on Afghanistan, according to court documents. \"They said that they only intended to travel to Afghanistan to help their Muslim brothers who are in trouble, who are bleeding and who are being victimized by Western forces,\" said the group's lawyer, Ameer Abdullah Rokhri. It was the first time the men, aged 19 to 25 and all from the Washington area, have addressed a court since their arrest.\n\nLoad-Date: January 6, 2010"
