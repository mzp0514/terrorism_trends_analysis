    "full text": "TO THE EDITOR:\nSusan Finn Miller's letter, \"Bring American troops home\" (Intell, Jan 18), spoke for many when she called the Iraqi war immoral.\nBut I have to ask if the Christians were immoral during the Crusades in their jihad (holy war) against the Muslims. Were the Americans immoral in their fight for freedom? Were Churchill and Roosevelt immoral to oppose the Nazis? Was Clinton immoral to depose Milosevic? Is the war on terrorism immoral? If the answer is no to any of these questions, what makes one war moral and another not?\nI was among millions who opposed Roosevelt's preparation for war in Europe, although my opposition wasn't on moral grounds. After all, we had few interests in Europe and, besides, we were protected by two oceans. Almost all of us in that camp changed our stripes overnight on December 7, 1941.\nI may have missed it, but I can't recall anyone saying that the Iraq war was immoral as Saddam's statue fell, and it looked like it would be a cakewalk. And those who feel that we have no interests in the Middle East are dreaming, like I was in 1941.\nSeveral years ago, columnist Tom Friedman suggested that the only known way to reduce terrorism in the Middle East is to convert the dictators and theocracies to some form of democracy. Quitting now would push our shaky start back well behind square one.\nBill Jewett, Willow Street\n\nLoad-Date: January 24, 2007"
