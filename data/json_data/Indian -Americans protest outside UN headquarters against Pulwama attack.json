This time we will not forgive and we will not forget,\" Sewhani said.\n\"Pakistan is still shielding terrorists and is refusing to crack down on them. The Pakistan Army continues to support terrorist outfits such as al-Qaeda, Lakshar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Haqqani network,\" he said, adding that \"time has come to give a befitting reply to Pakistan in a language it understands\".\nOverseas Friends of Bharatiya Janata Party-USA President Krishna Reddy Anugula said the Indian community in the US strongly condemns the \"dastardly\" attacks.\n\"We are demanding that the perpetrators of the attack should be brought to justice and the terror infrastructure based in Pakistan has to be dismantled,\" he said, adding that JeM chief Azhar should be handed over to India to face a trial.\n\"We are protesting Pakistan's cross-border terrorism in India and Afghanistan and sponsorship of global terrorism that has affected many countries around the world,\" Anugula said.\nSeveral people from other South Asian nations such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Nepal also joined the protest.\nRichard Benkin, a Jewish-American at the protest, said the international community stood in solidarity with India, noting that Pakistan's support for terrorism will not go unquestioned any longer.\nThe crowd raised slogans and held placards with messages reading 'Handover Masood Azhar-Global Terrorist', 'Pakistan Stop Harbouring Terrorists'and 'Pakistan Export Goods not Terrorism'.\nProtestors also spoke about the high casualties resulting from terrorism supported and launched from the Pakistani soil. They demanded that the UN make Pakistan accountable for the Pulwama, Mumbai and other terror attacks.\nThey also demanded that Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav be set free.\nThe protesting organisations also plan to send a memorandum of their demands to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.\nPramod Bhagat, President of India World Foundation USA, said that there was a need to reach out to the US lawmakers.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MetroVaartha English.
