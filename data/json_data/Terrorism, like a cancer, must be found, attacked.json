    "full text": "Over the last couple of months I have heard a lot of talk about the violent acts the United States is committing in Afghanistan. I would like to go on record as saying that I do not feel that what we are doing over there is violent any more than I would consider it violent for a surgeon to remove a malignant tumor from my body.\nTerrorism is a cancer, and like cancer it will not leave by its own accord but must be surgically removed from the face of the Earth.\nI would also like to address Donald L. Bragg's recent letter, \" 'God does not bless evil people or evil nations' \" (Nov. 10).\nWhat about the New York City police officers - and firefighters - at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11? They had just witnessed one of the towers come tumbling down and they knew full well that many of their comrades were trapped inside and had just given their lives trying to save others.\nThe very next thing they did was to rush into the second tower to save as many people as they could before it came tumbling down, also. A very short time later the second tower did come down on top of them, taking their lives as well.\nAre these the police officers Mr. Bragg spoke of in his letter? If he had been there that day and they were able to get him to safety before the building came down, would he still hold the same belief of our police forces?\nWilliam A. Barker\nBloomington\n\nLoad-Date: November 28, 2001"
