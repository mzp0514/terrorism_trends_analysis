    "full text": "A Palestinian motorist with a history of anti-Israel violence slammed his car into a crowded train station in Jerusalem on Wednesday, killing a 3-month-old baby girl and wounding eight people in what police called a terrorist attack.\nThe girl and her parents, who were injured in the attack, are U.S. citizens, Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat said.The violence came after months of tension between Jews and Palestinians in east Jerusalem - the section of the city the Palestinians demand as their future capital. The area has experienced unrest and near-daily attacks on the city's light rail by Palestinian youths since a wave of violence over the summer, capped by a 50-day war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza.\nThe car struck the train station near the national headquarters of Israel's police force. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the driver got out of the car and tried to flee before he was shot by a police officer.\nHe said footage captured by security cameras indicates the driver deliberately struck people waiting at the stop.\nWe look at this incident as a terrorist attack, Rosenfeld said.Dr. Yaakov Barkun of Hadassah Medical Center said a 3-month-old girl was injured in the attack and died of her wounds.\nIt was not immediately clear whether the baby and her parents also are Israeli citizen.\n\nLoad-Date: October 23, 2014"
