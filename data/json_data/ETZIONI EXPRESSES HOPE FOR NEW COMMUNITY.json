    "full text": "FROM EMPIRE TO COMMUNITY, by Amital Etzioni; St. Martin's $29.95.\nIn the continual contest between realists and optimists in international relations, Amitai Etzioni falls into the latter camp, and From Empire to Community is the rambling summation of his current thinking.\nThe growing awareness of terrorism and the deterioration of conditions in Iraq make his treatise that much more important, and also make it that much harder for him to persuade others of his positions.\nEtzioni's study pays particular attention to terrorism and reconstruction of the United Nations. He is optimistic about progress in the global anti-terrorism movement and the practicality of UN alteration.\nHe writes that \"50 nations, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan . . . have arrested suspected terrorists\" and that \"there is no place beyond the reach of global anti-terrorism.\" However, the fast pace of current history prevents his consideration of the inability of the de facto Anti-Terrorism Authority to come to grips in time with, for example, the explosion of a commuter train in Spain.\nEtzioni believes that regional building blocks such as the European Union and a revived Atlantic Alliance might ease the road to a global government. To him, \"An important piece of any new global architecture is the United Nations, though it will have to be reconstructed.\" Its great need is the ability to exercise power to back up UN decisions./\n\nLoad-Date: June 7, 2004"
