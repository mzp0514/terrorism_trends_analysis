He was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison.\nMegahed was not implicated in Mohamed's jihadist video, but he was indicted on weapons charges relating to the items in the car, which the defense maintained were homemade model rockets. Three days after a federal jury acquitted Megahed, he was picked up by immigration agents.\nThree days before Megahed's deportation hearing in August 2009, his parents and siblings were sworn in as American citizens.\nJudge Kenneth Hurewitz blocked the deportation. \"In spite of the scale of this investigation, the FBI did not uncover any evidence whatsoever linking (Megahed) with a particular plot, plan or intention to commit a terrorist act,\" he wrote. \"None of the FBI's interviews or other investigative work suggests that (Megahed) ever had or has the intent to harm anyone.\"\nAfter he was released, Megahed took and passed the citizenship test. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services failed to rule on his petition. He filed a lawsuit and forced an interview. Then in December -- more than a year after his third citizenship interview -- he sued again, trying to force a decision that law says must be made within 120 days.\nThree weeks after the lawsuit was filed, immigration authorities issued their ruling denying Megahed's citizenship. Even though Megahed prevailed twice before -- in the criminal trial and deportation hearing -- the rules are different for citizenship decisions, the notice pointed out.\nIn the other proceedings, the legal burden was on the government to prove the accusations. This time, Megahed had the task of proving himself worthy of citizenship -- that he is \"a person of good moral character; is a person attached to the principles of the United States Constitution; and is favorably disposed towards the good order and happiness of the United States.\"\nThe fact that Megahed was acquitted of criminal charges and not deported, the agency informed him, \"does not entitle you to a favorable decision on your naturalization application.\"\nKuck, Megahed's attorney, said Megahed has met his burden to prove he is a person of good moral character as defined by federal law. He has no criminal convictions and has done nothing wrong, Kuck said, and now the burden is on the government.\nThe agency filed a motion in federal court asking that Megahed's lawsuit be dismissed as moot because it had given Megahed his answer.\nBut Kuck responded by asking a judge to rule that the citizenship agency had forfeited its right to decide the case by not acting within 120 days as required by law. The service is \"determined to deny this application on grounds that hold no factual or legal basis,\" Kuck wrote. \"The service cannot be trusted with a review of this case given their demonstrated desire to deny our applicant a fair and constitutionally just hearing.\"\nThe agency's 17-page citizenship denial includes excerpts of transcripts of Megahed's three citizenship interviews in which he was interrogated about the South Carolina trip, whether he had viewed anti-American Internet sites and his relationship with Mohamed.\nWhen pushed for details about what was in the car when they were stopped, Megahed repeatedly referred the interview officer to \"the list,\" an apparent reference to an evidence log that had been provided to the agency.\n\"Your responses show a continuing pattern of vague, non-responsive testimony,\" the agency wrote.\nKuck said the agency selectively chose limited portions of transcripts of nearly 10 hours of interviews in which Megahed was asked the same questions \"over and over and over again.\" Megahed was \"frustrated\" with the questioning, Kuck said.\nThe agency also found Megahed's answers about his relationship to Mohamed to be \"non-responsive,\" which the notice says \"amounts to a failure to meet your burden of proof.\"\nKuck said Megahed \"had no involvement with what Mohamed was doing.\" Their friendship was \"not based on Mohamed's crazy tendencies in regards to terrorism.\"\nThe agency wrote that the amount of time the two spent together \"is important because it goes to an association with someone who had been arrested and detained in Egypt for supporting HAMAS (Islamic Resistance Movement) and other terrorist organizations; who was very open about his anti-American views; and who, after being arrested with you, eventually pled guilty in federal court to providing material support to terrorists.\n\"Your close association with Mohamed is also apparent from the 113 phone calls between you and Mohamed between June 6, 2007, and Aug. 3, 2007. Also, your excursion to a shooting range in Tampa, Florida to fire your Mossberg rifle with Mohamed and your possession of Mohamed's laptop computer at the time of the arrest in South Carolina indicate your level of association.\"\nMohamed's attorney, Lyann Goudie, said Mohamed was detained and tortured in Egypt for about three months after he was accused of donating to a charity that the government asserted supported terrorists. He eventually was cleared and released, she said. Goudie said the U.S. State Department investigated the allegations and also cleared Mohamed before he was allowed to enter the country on a student visa.\nesilvestrini@tampatrib.com\n(813) 259-7837\nCopyright Â© 2012, The Tampa Tribune and may not be republished without permission.
