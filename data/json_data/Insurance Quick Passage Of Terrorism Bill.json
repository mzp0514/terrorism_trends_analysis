    "full text": "Insurance executives said Republican control of the Senate offered a better chance to gain the government-backed terrorism-insurance program they have been calling for since the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.\n     If such a program were created, the government would pay most claims for damages suffered in a big terrorist attack. \n The House and Senate had reached a tentative agreement on such a program before Tuesday's election. But it stalled when Democrats refused to yield to Republican pressure to limit the ability of victims of terrorism to sue businesses for negligence.\nThe Democratic lawmakers had argued that if businesses knew that they could be held liable they would be more vigilant about security. Republican legislators had countered that terrorist attacks are beyond the control of business, and therefore businesses should not be held accountable for them.\nMichael McGavick, chief executive of the Safeco Corporation, a large Seattle-based insurer of homes, cars and small businesses, said he thought the program might be enacted by the present Congress, which reconvenes next Tuesday.\n\"I don't think there is any reason for either side to want to get to the next Congress to debate the terrorism issue again,\" he said. \"So I'm cautiously optimistic that we'll get a terrorism bill enacted before the end of the year.
