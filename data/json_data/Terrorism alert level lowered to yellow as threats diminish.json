    "full text": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- After 11 days at orange, the national terrorism alert level was dropped one notch to yellow Friday after officials determined that the threat of imminent al-Qaida strikes had diminished.\nThe alert level was changed after intelligence sources noted a modest decrease in terrorist threats.\nOfficials were also worried about a possible attack on Memorial Day, which passed without incident.\n\"The lowering of the threat level is not a signal to government, law enforcement or citizens that the danger of a terrorist attack has passed,\" Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge said in a statement. \"The U.S. intelligence community remains concerned that al-Qaida is attempting to exploit our weaknesses.\"\nNo domestic terrorist strikes were attempted during the relatively brief alert. Previous alerts lasted roughly a month.\nYellow indicates an elevated risk of terrorist attack, while orange, means a high risk.\nYellow is the middle level on a five-color scale. The lowest two levels, green and blue, and the highest, red, have not been used since the system was adopted in March 2002.\nHomeland Security officials say the system serves as guidance for law enforcement authorities, businesses and the public on how likely a terrorist attack is at a given time.\n\nLoad-Date: June 1, 2003"
