    "full text": "(RTTNews) - A court in Pakistan has ruled that the confessional statement of Ajmal Amir Kasab, the lone Pakistani Islamic terrorist captured by Indian commandos during the 2008 Mumbai attacks, could not be used against the accused in the Islamic nation.\nIn a ruling that could affect the trial of seven suspects, including Lashker commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, the Rawalpindi-based bench of the Lahore High Court gave its order in response to a petition filed by the accused being tried by an anti-terrorism court for planning and helping execute the 2008 Mumbai attacks.\nHowever, it dismissed the plea by Lakhvi and the other accused for acquittal, saying they could not be acquitted when their trial was under way in the anti-terrorism court.\nAccording to defense counsel of the accused, the Bench ruled that the statement made by Kasab to Indian authorities could not be used in a Pakistani court as it violated Article 43 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order of 1984 or the Evidence Act, which states: \"...the statement of an accused can be used against co-accused, only if they are all appearing in the same court for the same case.\"\nThe court order came as Indian prosecutors began their final arguments in the 26/11 trial Tuesday in a special court in Mumbai, pointing a direct finger at \"state actors involved in the security apparatus of Pakistan\" and blaming them for planning and executing the terror strike on India&apos;s financial capital that left 166, some of the American citizens, dead.\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\nCopyright(c) 2010 RTTNews.com, Inc.
