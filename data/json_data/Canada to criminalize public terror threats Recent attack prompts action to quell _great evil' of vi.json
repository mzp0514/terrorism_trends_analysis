The attack in Ottawa came two days after a man, said to be inspired by the Islamic State group, ran over two soldiers in a parking lot in Quebec, killing one and injuring the other before being shot to death.\nThe new law still has to be passed in Parliament, but Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Conservative government has a majority of the seats so passage is all but ensured.\nUnder current law it is a crime to make a specific threat. The new law will make it a crime for a person to call for terrorist attacks on Canada generally or to promote or advocate others to carry out terrorism elsewhere.\n\"We cannot tolerate this any more than we tolerate people that make jokes about bomb threats at airports,\" Harper said. \"Anyone engaging in that kind of activity is going to face the full force of the law in the future.\"\nThe penalty will be a maximum of five years in prison. Authorities will also be able to remove terrorist-related material from any Canadian website.\nHarper said jihadists had declared war on Canada and it would be a grave mistake to ignore their threats. \"Over the last few years a great evil has been descending upon our world, an evil that has been growing more and more powerful, violent jihadism,\" Harper said.\nUnder the current law those suspected of being involved in a terrorist plot can be detained for up to three days. The new law extends that to seven days provided police get a judge's permission.\nThe new law will also allow the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, the country's spy service, to directly approach terrorism suspects in order to disrupt their plans. CSIS is currently permitted only to collect intelligence and pass the information on to police.\nThe spy agency will now be able to cancel plane or other travel reservations made by Canadians suspected of being involved in terrorism. The new activities by CSIS will require approval by a judge. Police already have many of these powers that CSIS will acquire, but the government wanted the spy agency to be able to act quickly if they see a threat.\nKent Roach, a law professor at the University of Toronto, said the law that made it a crime to encourage terrorism would probably not hold up in court. He called it too vague.\n\"There is a potential that it will chill expression,\" Roach said. \"It could be seen as disproportionately targeting the Muslim community and expressions of general support for terrorism in some parts of the world.\"\nJustice Minister Peter MacKay said it targeted those who advocated terrorism with intent and didn't deal with glorification. MacKay said his government wanted to work with other countries to remove terrorist material coming from websites outside Canada.\n\"We need to work toward a system that will allow for the removal or at least the blocking of information that is provocative and that is aimed at promoting terrorism,\" MacKay said. \"That will require international protocols and a greater level of cooperation with our international partners.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \n Prime Minister Stephen Harper makes an announcement in Richmond Hill, Canada on Friday, Jan. 30, 2015.
