While the numbers have been reported to INTERPOL and are in their database, \"member states highlighted that their use by returnees or relocators is possible.\"\nThe experts said countries bordering Iraq and Syria have highlighted \"continued challenges\" in identifying IS foreign fighters seeking to return home or relocate, as well as those on the U.N. sanctions blacklist.\nThe report urged use of biometric data, fingerprints and high-quality pictures to identify IS fighters.\nIt noted that the flow of new foreign fighters to Iraq and Syria \"has almost come to a halt.\"\nIn the past six months, the experts said, governments and organizations at all levels have continued to strengthen cooperation with the private sector on sharing sensitive information on terrorism-financing patterns and suspect individuals.\nThis has enabled \"law enforcement authorities to disrupt travel by foreign terrorist fighters, detect terrorists and individuals associated with terrorism networks and bring terrorists to justice,\" the report said.\n\nLoad-Date: February 7, 2018"
