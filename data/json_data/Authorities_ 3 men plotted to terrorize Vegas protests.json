PRICE\nand SCOTT SONNER\nThe Associated Press\nLAS VEGAS - Three Nevada men with ties to a loose movement of right-wing extremists advocating the overthrow of the U.S. government have been arrested on terrorism-related charges in what authorities say was a conspiracy to spark violence during recent protests in Las Vegas.\nFederal prosecutors say the three white men with U.S. military experience are accused of conspiring to carry out a plan that began in April in conjunction with protests to reopen businesses closed because of the coronavirus.\nMore recently, they sought to capitalize on protests over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis after a white officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air, prosecutors said.\nThe three men were arrested Saturday on the way to a protest in downtown Las Vegas after filling gas cans at a parking lot and making Molotov cocktails in glass bottles, according to a copy of the criminal complaint obtained by The Associated Press.\n\"People have a right to peacefully protest. These men are agitators and instigators. Their point was to hijack the protests into violence,\" Nicholas Trutanich, U.S. attorney in Nevada, told AP. He referred to what he called \"real and legitimate outrage\" over Floyd's death.\nThe complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas on Wednesday said they self-identified as part of the \"boogaloo\" movement, which U.S. prosecutors said in the document is \"a term used by extremists to signify coming civil war and/or fall of civilization.\"\nStephen T. Parshall, 35, Andrew T. Lynam Jr., 23, and William L. Loomis, 40, were being held on $1 million bond each in the Clark County Jail Wednesday, according to court records. Lynam is from suburban Henderson and the others are from Las Vegas.\nThe complaint said Lynam is an Army reservist, with Parshall formerly enlisted in the Navy and Loomis formerly enlisted in the Air Force.\nEach currently faces two federal charges - conspiracy to damage and destroy by fire and explosive, and possession of unregistered firearms. In state court, they've been accused of felony conspiracy, terrorism and explosives possession. Trutanich said they'll be prosecuted in both jurisdictions.\n\"This type of planning and intent on causing mayhem is terroristic and will not be tolerated,\" said Steve Wolfson, the district attorney in Las Vegas.\nAttorney Monti Levy, representing Loomis, declined to comment about the state case and did not immediately respond to a question about whether she'll represent Loomis in federal court.\nA deputy public defender representing Parshall declined to comment and an attorney appointed to represent Lynam did not immediately respond to messages.\nA confidential informant met Lynam and Parshall at an early April rally in Las Vegas calling for the reopening of the state's economy, the federal complaint said. The men were carrying firearms and Lynam said the group \"was not for joking around and that it was for people who wanted to violently overthrow the United States government,\" according to the complaint.\nThe informant said that during a May 27 meeting, Parshall and Loomis \"discussed causing an incident to incite chaos and possibly a riot, in response to the death of a suspect,\" a reference to Floyd.\nLoomis stated he wanted to firebomb a power substation, according to the informant in the criminal complaint.\nBut on May 28, Lynam instructed the group to observe the riots occurring nationwide and use that momentum as a driving force to possibly take action against a fee station at Lake Mead on federal land north of the Hoover Dam, on May 30. Other targets discussed included a U.S. Forest Service ranger station, the complaint said.\nThe informant stated that Parshall and Loomis' \"idea behind the explosion was to hopefully create civil unrest and rioting throughout Las Vegas.\"\nThe anti-government \"boogaloo\" movement is a loose network of gun enthusiasts who often express support for overthrowing the U.S. government. Its name, a reference to a 1984 movie sequel called \"Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo,\" is a code word for a second civil war.\nThe movement is rooted in online meme culture, but the coronavirus pandemic has become a catalyst for real-world activity. Many \"boogaloo\" followers have shown up at COVID-19 lockdown protests armed with rifles and wearing tactical vests over Hawaiian shirts and leis, a nod to the \"big luau\" derivation of the movement's name.\nWhile some \"boogaloo\" promoters insist they aren't genuinely advocating for violence, law-enforcement officials say they have foiled bombing and shooting plots by people who have connections to the movement or at least used its terminology.\n\nLoad-Date: June 4, 2020"
