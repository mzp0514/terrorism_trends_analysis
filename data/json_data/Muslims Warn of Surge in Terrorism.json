    "full text": "Muslim leaders meeting for the first time since the start of the crisis in Lebanon warned Thursday that the fighting could spawn further acts of terrorism, while Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, suggested that the solution to the crisis was to eliminate Israel.\n  ''This war must stop or it will radicalize the Muslim world, even those of us who are moderate today,'' news agencies quoted Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the president of Indonesia, as saying at an emergency meeting of the Organization of the Islamic Conference outside Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n''From there, it will be just one step away to that ultimate nightmare: a clash of civilizations,'' he said.\n  Leaders from 17 Muslim nations issued a joint statement calling for an immediate cease-fire and an investigation by the United Nations into what they called ''criminal acts perpetrated by Israel.'' \n  Several also said they would be willing to contribute peacekeepers if they were placed under the control of the United Nations.\n  The meeting was called last week by Malaysia, which holds the rotating chairmanship of the 57-nation organization. The session was in turn both strident and moderate in tone. \n  ''Though elimination of the Zionist regime is the main solution to the current crisis, at this stage a cease-fire should be immediately established,'' Mr. Ahmadinejad said, in remarks translated by Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency. \n  Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain later called the comment ''deeply unhelpful.''\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: August 4, 2006"
