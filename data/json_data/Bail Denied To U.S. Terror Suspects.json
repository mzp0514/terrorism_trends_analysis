Prosecutors urged the court to deny the seven suspects bail, stating that all of them pose a risk of flight and a danger to the community as a whole.\nAll the defendants are charged with conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists, as well as conspiracy to murder, kidnap, maim and injure persons abroad. The charges are related to allegations that they helped raise money and provide training for terrorist operations in Tel Aviv, Israel. The men were arrested at various locations in Raleigh, North Carolina.\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\nCopyright(c) 2009 RTTNews.com, Inc.
