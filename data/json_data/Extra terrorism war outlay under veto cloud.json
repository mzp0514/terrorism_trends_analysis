    "full text": "It's beginning to look as if Congress is incapable of writing defense legislation that doesn't   draw the threat of a veto.\nWhite House budget officials   had warned that the House and   Senate versions of the 2003 defense authorization bill need   major changes before President   Bush signs them into law.\nNow,   serious problems have surfaced   with the House and Senate versions of the 2002 supplemental   appropriations bill, needed to   cover the continuing costs for the   war on terrorism this year.\nThe White House Office of   Management and Budget issued   a direct veto threat for the   House's $29.4 billion supplemental bill because it contains language preventing the administration from scrapping the Crusader artillery system.\nOMB hasn't issued a definitive   statement on the Senate version   of the supplemental bill, which   would spend $4 billion more   than the House bill on non-military programs. But White House   officials have said they don't   want to spend any extra money.\nOMB's view that the line   should be held on spending even   in wartime is made clear in the   policy statement on the House   bill that discusses a $1.8 billion   increase included for the military.\nTo avoid a veto threat over the   increased spending - while also   appeasing deficit hawks who   don't see the war as an excuse for   a financial free-for-all - the   House bill gives Bush discretion   over whether to spend the extra   funds on the military.\nThe White House wanted Congress to complete work on the   supplemental funding bill by   Memorial Day, but internal disagreements and the threat of a   veto made any compromise impossible before lawmakers left   for their holiday week recess.\n\nLoad-Date: June 18, 2004"
