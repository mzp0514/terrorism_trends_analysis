    "full text": "The insurance industry needs to prepare for the end of federal involvement in terrorism insurance.\nEmil Henry, assistant secretary of the Treasury for financial institutions, made it clear that the Bush administration continues to view a government role in backstopping terrorism insurance as temporary. Mr. Henry was addressing the Networks Financial Institute at Indiana State University's annual insurance summit in Washington last week.\nThe backstop created by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, which was designed to help insurers cope with losses from future catastrophic terrorist attacks, was intended as ``a bridge to allow the marketplace to adjust'' to the dislocations that followed the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, he said.\nWhile TRIA helped make terrorism coverage available and affordable, the administration believes that it crowded out private market solutions to insuring against terrorism-related losses, he said.\nA scaled-back version of the backstop will run through the end of 2007, and a presidential working group-in consultation with policyholders, regulators, insurers and others-must make a report to Congress on the state of terrorism insurance marketplace by Sept. 30. ``All viewpoints on these issues will be useful,'' said Mr. Henry.\nBut the administration remains committed to having the private sector develop long-term solutions to the problem of underwriting and providing terrorism coverage, said Mr. Henry. He said the Bush administration expects the insurance industry to step up and ``prepare the marketplace for the inevitable disappearance of TRIA.''\n\nLoad-Date: March 10, 2006"
