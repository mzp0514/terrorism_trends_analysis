    "full text": "Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev has made a career out of taunting the Russian bear. For three years, he has threatened everything from Islamic holy war to nuclear terrorism, defying demands to lead tiny Chechnya back into the Kremlin's fold.\nNow the bear is mad.\n\"If Russia tries to settle the Chechen problem by force, there will be a war in the Caucasus that will eclipse Afghanistan,\" Dudayev warned recently.\nDudayev's sins, in the eyes of the Kremlin, are many. He has played on Moscow's worst fears - the mafia, Islam, nationalism.\nChechens were conquered by imperial Russia in a long, bloody war in the 19th century. They died by the tens of thousands during mass deportations in the Stalin era.\nDudayev was born in 1944, the year his people were loaded into cattle cars and shipped off to Central Asia. His first 13 years were spent in exile.\nHe had every reason to hate the Soviet system, but thrived within it. He was a member of the Communist Party. The system made him the first Chechen general in the Russian air force.\nRiding popular opposition to the August 1991 Soviet coup attempt, Dudayev's supporters seized control in Chechnya. In October, Dudayev was elected president in a landslide. He took the oath of office with his hand on the Koran. He declared independence the same day.\n\nLoad-Date: December 17, 1994"
