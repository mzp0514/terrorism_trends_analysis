    "full text": "Gone country\n\"The CMT Music Awards 2018\" may not be as star-studded as other ceremonies, but it's enough of a platform to attract Carrie Underwood, Blake Shelton and Chris Stapleton. It'll be interesting to see if the country world embraces Justin Timberlake, who was nominated for his duet with Stapleton. Little Big Town hosts.\n7 p.m., CMT\nA piece of the action\nIn \"Impulse,\" director Doug Liman (\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith,\" \"The Bourne Identity\") tries to generate heat on the small screen. Make that very small screen. The series, in which a rebellious teenager discovers she can transport under times of stress, is the most ambitious to date for YouTube, and while it's a genuine thriller, the action often feels too \"big\" to watch on a cellphone.\nNow streaming on YouTube Red\nTrust no one\n\"Three Days of the Condor,\" the 1975 film in which Robert Redford can't trust the government, was ripe for a contemporary reboot, and \"Condor\" doesn't disappoint, at least not in the compelling series premiere. Max Irons plays a CIA analyst who may have stopped a domestic terrorism attack, but can't avoid being the target of his own people. William Hurt is, once again, the bureaucrat who's smarter than everyone else in the room and isn't afraid to flaunt it.\n9 p.m., DirecTV\nNEAL JUSTIN\n\nLoad-Date: June 7, 2018"
