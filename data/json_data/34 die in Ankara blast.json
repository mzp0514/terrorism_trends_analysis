Two of the dead are believed to be the assailants.\nA senior government official told The Associated Press that police suspect that Kurdish militants carried out the attack, which occurred on Ankara`s main boulevard, close to ministries.\nAt least one of the bombers was a woman, he said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity on the grounds that the investigation was ongoing.\nThe bombing was the third in the city in five months and came as Turkey is grappling with a host of issues, including renewed fighting with Kurdish rebels, threats from the Islamic State group and a Syrian refugee crisis.\nEarlier Sunday, Turkish authorities said they were imposing curfews on two mainly Kurdish towns where Turkey`s security forces were set to launch large-scale operations against Kurdish militants. Russia on Sunday also accused Turkey of sending its military across the Syrian border to prevent Kurdish groups there from consolidating their positions.\nThe attack came just three weeks after a suicide car bombing in the capital targeted buses carrying military personnel, killing 29 people. A Kurdish militant group which is an offshoot of an outlawed rebel group, the Kurdistan Workers` Party, or PKK, claimed responsibility for the Feb. 17 attack.\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan issued a statement vowing to bring \"terrorism to its knees\" and said Turkey would use its right to self-defense to prevent future attacks.\n\"Our people should not worry, the struggle against terrorism will for certain end in success and terrorism will be brought to its knees,\" Erdogan said.\n\nLoad-Date: March 14, 2016"
