    "full text": "Three American men arrested at Harare's international airport with a large cache of weapons will be charged with terrorism and international espionage against two African nations, Zimbabwean police said.\nThe Americans arrested Sunday in Harare were identified yesterday as Gary George Blanchfield, Jonah Lamonte-Dixon and Joseph Pettijohn.\nTheir ages range from 34 to 37, and at least one of them is from Indiana, police said.\n\"Through investigations, we have discovered that, under the guise of a church, these highly trained saboteurs were on a mission of terrorism and espionage in Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of Congo,\" the commissioner of Zimbabwe's national police forces, Augustin Chihuri, said.\nThe men were arrested as they tried to board a Swissair flight to Zurich, and Zimbabwean police said they were searching for two other Americans who apparently escaped. Police did not identify the wanted Americans.\nThe men reportedly told police that they were employees of the John Dixon Window Cleaning Co. in Indianapolis who were on a hunting trip in Zimbabwe. Directory information lists no such company in Indianapolis, and police dismissed the hunting alibi.\nAuthorities said they suspected that the men were part of an assassination squad associated with rebels fighting to overthrow Congolese President Laurent Kabila.\nOfficials at the U.S. Embassy in Harare declined comment. Embassy spokesmen have said repeatedly that the three have no official connection to the U.S. government.\n\nLoad-Date: October 22, 2002"
