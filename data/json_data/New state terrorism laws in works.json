    "full text": "Laws passed after the World War I 1918 flu epidemic to help Maryland officials respond to health crises are not sufficient to deal with modern terrorist threats, Health Secretary George Benjamin said yesterday.\nMr. Benjamin outlined problems the state would face dealing with bioterrorism attacks at the first meeting of the AntiTerrorism Workgroup, which was appointed to recommend changes in state laws when the legislature meets in January.\nWhile current laws are useful, an attack with deadly bacteria or viruses would require an extraordinarily rapid response that would be difficult under current laws, he said.\nThe task force was appointed by Gov. Parris Glendening, House Speaker Casper Taylor, D-Allegany, and Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller, D-Prince George's.\nThe task force will gather information on terrorism \"and put forth ideas to make Maryland a safer place,\" said Col. David Mitchell, state police superintendent.\nHe said the task force is intended to provide a single, coordinated package of legislation that can be introduced with the support of the governor and legislative leaders.\nMr. Benjamin said current laws were intended to give health officials power to respond to natural outbreaks of communicable diseases.\n\"It doesn't take into account someone intentionally doing that. We do think these powers need to be modernized,\" Mr. Benjamin said.\nMr. Benjamin also cited the need to develop ways to quickly contain outbreaks of communicable diseases such as smallpox and the necessity of having quicker, better communication among health and public safety officials in Maryland and other states and more direct power over hospitals to deal with a major outbreak of smallpox or other communicable disease.\n\nLoad-Date: November 20, 2001"
