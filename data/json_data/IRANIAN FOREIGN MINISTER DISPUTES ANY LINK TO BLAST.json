    "full text": "Iran's foreign minister yesterday rejected any suggestion that Tehran was behind the bombing that killed 19 U.S. servicemen in Saudi Arabia.\n\"All these accusations are without foundation. We are totally against terrorism,\" Ali-Akbar Velayati said at a news conference in Kiev. \"We have been victims of terrorism ourselves. We are in no way involved in this.\"\nTwo groups have claimed responsibility for Tuesday's blast outside an apartment building housing U.S. troops in Dhahran. Israeli President Ezer Weizman blamed Iran outright for the attack.\nVelayati said Israel's current leadership, \"at least some people within it, were terrorists at one time when they illegally founded their state. In southern Lebanon, we see constant Israeli bombardments, they kill people and are involved in terrorism.\"\nVelayati was in Kiev to attend talks on economic ties with Ukraine and Turkmenistan.\nU.S. officials acknowledged they had no leads on who the bombers were, and said they doubted several anonymous claims of responsibility.\nIn London, an Arabic newspaper said an anonymous caller had claimed responsibility for the bombing on behalf of a previously unknown group. The caller identified the group as the Legion of the Martyr Abdullah al-Hufaizi - a Saudi citizen beheaded last year for throwing acid at a policeman.\nThe daily Al-Arab said the caller threatened more attacks if foreign forces \"occupying the holy Saudi land\" did not withdraw.\nIt was impossible to determine if such a group actually exists.\nAmerican broadcast networks reported a second responsibility claim made by another unknown group calling itself Hezbollah-Gulf. U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said a claim also was made to a newspaper in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. It wasn't clear whether that was a separate, third claim.\nU.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was not inclined to believe the claims. \"Where terrorism is concerned,\" he said, \"first guesses usually are wrong.\"\nBurns added: \"We have no leads whatsoever.\"\nSaudi Arabia posted a $2.7 million reward for information leading to the arrests of suspects.\n\nLoad-Date: October 28, 2002"
