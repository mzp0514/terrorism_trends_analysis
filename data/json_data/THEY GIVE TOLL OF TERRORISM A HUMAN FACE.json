Another visitor, Rachel Dahan, is slowly putting her life back together after a suicide bomber killed her brother, Tzion, during an attack last year in Ashdod Port, Israel.\n\"We want people to understand our story,\" said Dahan, 38. \"There are two sides to the story. We have to manage our lives with each other [the Palestinians]. Otherwise, there will be war forever.\"\nafenner@nydailynews.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \nDEBBIE EGAN-CHIN DAILY NEWS Vered Yarimi, 20, had both legs severely injured when she was fired on by terrorists in Israel.\n\nLoad-Date: July 19, 2005"
