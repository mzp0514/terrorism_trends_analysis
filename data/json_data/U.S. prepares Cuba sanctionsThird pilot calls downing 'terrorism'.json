Cuba denied it. U.S. officials conceded\na third plane flew over Cuban waters within 12 miles of Havana\nbefore the attack.\n\"We had been warned before . . . but we never thought Castro\nwould commit this act of terrorism of murdering two unarmed pilots,\"\nsaid Jose Basulto, the pilot who returned, at the Opa-Locka, Fla.,\nairport.\nBasulto is founder of Brothers to the Rescue, which patrols the\nStraits of Florida in search of exiles. The group has brazenly\nflown over Cuba dropping anti-Castro leaflets. U.S. aviation officials\nare considering revoking Basulto's pilot license.\nThe search for four people from the planes resumes today. Cuba\nhas opened its waters to the searchers.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO FIRST, color, Roberto Schmidt, AFP; PHOTO, Color, Colin Braley, Reuters; U.S. prepares Cuba sanctionsThird pilot calls downing 'terrorism'\n\nLoad-Date: March 4, 1996"
