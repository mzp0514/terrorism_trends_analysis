    "full text": "Israeli soldiers killed two Palestinian youths yesterday as fury over the Hebron mosque massacre spread to Jericho, where the PLO plans to set up its headquarters under a peace plan with Israel.\nIn an effort to curb the bloodletting, security forces disarmed seven extremist Jewish settlers in the occupied territories and banned them from Palestinian areas.\nBut that was unlikely to placate Palestinians demanding international protection and removal of Jewish settlements in the territories.\nForeign Minister Shimon Peres reiterated the government's refusal to budge on the settlement issue. But Peres told Jewish media representatives in Jerusalem last night that the government ''is not blind'' to the need to make concessions to the PLO to resume talks.\nMilitant Palestinians called for revenge attacks for Friday's massacre of Palestinian worshipers by a Jewish settler in Hebron. The government put its embassies and citizens abroad on alert. Rabin's terrorism adviser, Yigal Pressler, urged Israelis with gun permits to carry their weapons at all times.\nIn Jericho, a normally peaceful town, trouble flared when 400 Palestinians protested the mosque massacre. Protesters stoned army vehicles and a police station. Troops on rooftops fired at youths using slingshots. A teen-ager was killed in the shooting, and about 20 people were injured or wounded.\nIn Hebron, a 17-year-old Palestinian was shot dead, and 33 Arabs were injured in clashes with soldiers after the military lifted a 6-day-old curfew for two hours to let people shop.\n\nLoad-Date: September 15, 1994"
