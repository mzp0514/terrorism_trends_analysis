Here's a selection of recent queries.\nQ: I could not stand \"My Name is Earl,\" but I truly like \"Memphis Beat.\" Is Jason Lee really singing the songs? Or is he just lip singing?\n-- Diane, 56, Arlington\nRob: According to a TNT publicist, Jason Lee is not singing. The singing is done by Mark Arnell.\nQ: When does the new season of \"Son's of Anarchy\" begin?\n-- Steven, 69, McMurray\nRob: \"Sons\" is back on FX on Tuesday. I watched the season premiere and was not initially wowed until the final scene, which was full of \"Holy cow!\" moments that give me hope for a strong season to follow.\nQ: I would like to know if Jillian and Ed are still together from \"The Bachlorette\" series and if and when there are any plans for a wedding?\n-- Kathy, 64, West Mifflin, PA\nRob: Don't buy them a gift just yet: In recent months reports surfaced that they are at the very least \"taking some time apart.\"\nQ: It's been YEARS since I've been excited about the fall TV season, but I am now that CBS is bringing back the big wave on \"Hawaii Five-0.\" Please tell me that not only will I see updated versions of Steve McGarrett, Dan-O, Chin-Ho, Che, Kono and The Governor, but also plenty of smuggling, espionage and terrorism all conducted by a nefarious bunch of sinister characters of ill-repute like Red Chinese spymaster Wo-Fat and others.\n-- Rand-O, 44, Pittsburgh\nRob: Many of the characters from the original are back -- in this new \"Hawaii Five-0\" Jean Smart plays the governor of Hawaii -- and the pilot has some fantastic fight sequences, along with terrorism and human trafficking plots. But the show's drama is overwrought and the tone is utterly humorless.\nQ: I liked \"Saving Grace,\" and think the writers ought to get some sort of award for doing religion and not making it saccharine. The last episode was a hard thing to watch and TNT made it a little harder by cutting into the last few minutes with a promo for \"Hawthorne.\" I'd love to know if I missed anything, and how many angry viewers contacted TNT to complain.\n-- Jean\nRob: You're the only complaint I've gotten on a promo cut-in, but I know June's \"Saving Grace\" finale itself was polarizing and some viewers did not like it at all.\nQ: Watching all the shows that are on 24/7 on hundreds of channels seems like an impossible task. How do you do it?\n-- Kathleen, Pittsburgh\nRob: One person can't watch everything. I try to keep up with the shows that are most likely to lead to viewer questions -- serialized shows more than procedurals -- and I do a lot of reading about TV, even the shows I don't make time to watch.\n\nNotes\n\nAsk TV questions at post-gazette.com/tv under TV Q&A./\n\nLoad-Date: September 9, 2010"
