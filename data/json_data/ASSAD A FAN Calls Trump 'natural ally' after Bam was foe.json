The bombings pounded hospitals, a blood bank and targets near schools, activists said.\nFrance's UN ambassador says attacks against medical facilities in Syria by the government and its allies \"are war crimes.\" Francois Delattre strongly condemned renewed air strikes targeting hospitals.\n\"Make no mistake about it,\" Delattre said. \"Bombing Aleppo and its population is not fighting against terrorism, as the regime pretends. What the regime and its allies are doing in Aleppo is actually fueling terrorism, it's fueling radicalization.\"\nMeanwhile, Turkey's president criticized protests in the U.S. against Trump, saying the President-elect should be given time to show how he will govern.\nPresident Tayyip Erdogan, who has tightened his ironclad control in Turkey following an attempted coup in July, said the protesters were \"attacking\" Trump because \"the person they wanted wasn't elected President.\"\n\"Hold on a second. The election process just ended, show some respect! How will he govern, let's see that first,\" he said.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nSyrian leader Bashar Assad (below) sees President-elect Donald Trump as an ally in war on rebels (above) that has wracked his country.
