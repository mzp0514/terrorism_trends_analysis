    "full text": "Congress is poised this week to finish revamping the government's student\nloan guarantee program in a way that will cut into bank profits.\nThe House on Monday approved wide-ranging deficit reduction legislation\nmeant to save $39.7 billion over the next five years. The legislation would\neliminate millions of dollars in subsidies the government pays lenders when\ninterest rates are low and make other changes that would cut lender yields.\nThose changes include giving students a fixed interest rate when they\nconsolidate loans and reducing federal insurance by 1 percentage point, to\n97% of the loan.\nUnlike earlier versions of student lending reform, the final bill does\nnot include incentives to encourage students to bypass private lenders and\nborrow directly from the government.\nThe Senate was expected to vote on the bill as early as Monday night.\nOver the weekend the House and Senate approved legislation to extend\nuntil 2007 the government's terrorism insurance program, which had been set\nto expire Dec. 31. The extension ensures that property owners can purchase\ninsurance to cover acts of terrorism.\nUnder the program, established after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the\ngovernment pays a portion of claims on property destroyed in substantial\nterrorist strikes and mandates that insurers sell policies to cover smaller\nstrikes.\nThe bill extending the program increases the amount insurers must pay if \nthere is an attack.\nTaxpayers would have to pay a portion of claims of over $50 million next\nyear and over $100 million in 2007. Under the original program, the\ngovernment's obligation this year would be triggered by claims of over $5\nmillion.\nhttp://www.americanbanker.com            http://www.sourcemedia.com\n\nLoad-Date: October 31, 2006"
