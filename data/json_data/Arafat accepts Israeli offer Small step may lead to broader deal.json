    "full text": "WASHINGTON -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Tuesday that\nhe accepts an Israeli offer to pull back from an additional 13%\nof the West Bank of the Jordan River.\n\"We agreed to it to facilitate the negotiations for a (peace)\nsettlement,\" Arafat said after a one-hour meeting with President\nClinton at the White House. \"Peace is a Palestinian need, Israeli\nneed, Arab need, international need.\"\nAsked if a broader deal could be reached next month in Washington\ntalks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Arafat replied,\n\"We hope so.\"\nU.S. officials have cautioned that several key issues remain unresolved,\nparticularly Israeli concerns about Palestinian efforts to crack\ndown on terrorism. But Arafat's comments added to hopes of ending\na long stalemate in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. They reinforced\ndiplomats' notion that the contentious West Bank withdrawal issue\nhas been largely settled and that negotiators are now focusing\non the issue of the Palestinian fight against terrorism.\nThe land Israel has offered to hand over would give Palestinians\nfull or partial control over about 40% of the West Bank territory\nIsrael won in a 1967 war.\nArafat conditioned his acceptance by insisting that 3% of the\nterritory -- a desert nature reserve -- be under joint Israeli-Palestinian\nsecurity control. Israeli officials, who had wanted sole control\nof security in the nature reserve, hinted they could accept a\ncompromise. And they said talks now center on fighting terrorism,\nnot on territory.\nIsrael wants Arafat to jail terrorists, cut down on his armed\npolice force, collect illegal arms and formally revoke a Palestine\nLiberation Organization charter calling for the destruction of\nIsrael.\nWhite House spokesman Mike McCurry said a Palestinian crackdown\non terrorism was a focus of Arafat's talks with Clinton and \"a\ncentral element\" of peace talks.\nThere has been no breakthrough in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks\nsince January 1997, when Netanyahu and Arafat agreed upon a pullback\nfrom the city of Hebron.\nU.S. officials cautioned that no final agreement has been reached,\ndespite signs of optimism after Arafat and Netanyahu's visits\nto the White House this week.\nMcCurry said while issues remain unresolved, \"momentum\" has\nbeen added to the talks.\nNetanyahu and Arafat met separately with President Clinton, and\nalso together with him, Monday. Before Sunday, when the two leaders\nmet with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in New York, they\nhad not been together in a year.\nBoth leaders agreed to come back to Washington in mid-October\nfor intensive discussions aimed at finalizing a peace agreement.\n\"I think the president is determined to see an agreement arise\nfrom this exercise,\" McCurry said.\nU.S. officials are so far discouraging any speculation that the\nsummit could be at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md.\nThat was where an Egyptian-Israeli peace agreement was forged\nin 1978.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO, b/w, Mike Theiler, Reuters\n\nLoad-Date: September 30, 1998"
