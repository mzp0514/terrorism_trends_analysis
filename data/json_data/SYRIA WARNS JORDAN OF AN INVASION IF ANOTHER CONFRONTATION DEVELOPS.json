    "full text": "A Syrian leader, accusing Jordan of continued conspiracies against the Government of President Hafez alAssad, has declared that Syrian forces will not stop at the Jordanian border if a new military confrontation is ordered.\nThe statement, which recalled the Syrian actions of last month in massing troops and tanks at the Syrian-Jordanian frontier, was in a speech by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Abdel Halim Khaddam last night at a rally staged in Damascus by Al Fatah, the principal Palestinian guerrilla organization, to mark its 16th anniversary.\nMr. Khaddam, whose remarks were quoted by the Damascus radio today, said Syria would help the Jordanian people rise against their Government and would make it possible for Palestinian guerrillas to re-establish bases in Jordan for operations against Israel. The Jordanian Army drove the guerrillas out 11 years ago.\nSyrian Deputy Prime Minister Abdel Halim Khaddam warns Jordan of possible invasion if new confrontation is ordered\nThe speech followed the publication of an article in the semiofficial Syrian newspaper Al Thawra that said the armed forces might stop what it said were anti-Syrian conspiracies by King Hussein.\n \nTerrorism in Syria Rises\nThese statements appeared to be related to increased terrorism against the Syrian Government in the last three weeks by the Moslem Brotherhood, a right-wing organization that is outlawed in Syria. Mr. Khaddam reiterated his Government's charges that King Hussein had been harboring and helping members of the group.\nIn the next confrontation, Mr. Khaddam said, ''no mediation will be able to save the regime in Amman.'' The last confrontation, in which about 30,000 Syrian troops and 24,000 Jordanian troops were stationed near the border, ended last month after Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia made several trips to Damascus and Amman.\nSyria began massing its troops shortly before an Arab League meeting in Amman that was boycotted by Syria, among others. The Syrians had wanted the meeting postponed, saying the Arab world was too divided over various issues, including the war between Iraq and Iran, to agree on a new strategy against Israel."
