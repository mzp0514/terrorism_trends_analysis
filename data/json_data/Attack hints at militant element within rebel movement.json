A much larger blast soon followed, shaking the neighborhood, setting dozens of cars ablaze and sending up a gray mushroom cloud visible around the capital.\nSyrian state TV video showed dozens of bodies, some charred or dismembered, strewn in the rubble or still inside damaged cars. An Associated Press reporter at the scene saw medics in rubber gloves picking through the site for human remains amid the two craters that were blasted into the asphalt.\nThe Interior Ministry, which oversees the police and security services, said 55 people were killed and more than 370 were wounded. Officials said suicide bombers detonated explosives weighing more than 2,200 pounds.\n\"The house shook like it was an earthquake,\" Maha Hijazi said, standing outside her home nearby.\nWorld powers seeking to halt Syria's unrest condemned the attack and urged all sides to adhere to a cease-fire brokered by U.N. and Arab League envoy Kofi Annan.\n\"In order to prevent another escalation of violence, we continue to call on the Syrian regime to fully and immediately implement the Annan plan,\" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said in Washington.\nBritish Foreign Secretary William Hague said \"the onus is on the Syrian authorities to implement a full cease-fire and begin the political dialogue required by the Annan plan,\" while the U.N. Security Council said that \"any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable regardless of their motivation.\"\nMaj. Gen. Robert Mood, the Norwegian head of a team of observers overseeing the cease-fire, toured the site and said the Syrian people do not deserve this \"terrible violence.\"\n\"It is not going to solve any problems,\" he said. \"It is only going to create more suffering for women and children.\"\nAnnan, too, appealed for calm.\n\"The Syrian people have already suffered too much,\" he said in a statement.\nThe government blamed the attack on armed terrorists it says are driving the uprising, which has grown into the strongest threat to the Assad family dynasty in its four decades in power.\nThe Syrian Foreign Ministry sent letters to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the head of the Security Council, asking the body \"to take steps against states, parties and media outlets that practice and encourage terrorism,\" Syria's state news service said.\nSyria's U.N. ambassador, Bashar Ja'afari, told the Security Council that a second bombing in Aleppo on Thursday also killed civilians and damaged property.\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said five intelligence officers were killed when a bomb targeted their car in Aleppo. It was unclear if this was the same event.\nA leader of the Free Syrian Army, an umbrella group of anti-regime militias throughout the country, condemned the Damascus attack and denied the group was involved. Capt. Ammar al-Wawi accused the government of staging the attack to turn the world against the uprising.\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility, but a shadowy militant group calling itself the Al-Nusra Front has claimed past attacks through statements on militant websites. Little is known about the group, although Western intelligence officials say it could be a front for al-Qaida's Iraq branch.\n\nLoad-Date: May 14, 2012"
