So they were very well prepared.\"\nPolice said that several shots were fired shortly on a lively street in the city center and that there were six shooting locations. Unverified footage posted on social media showed gunmen walking through the streets, apparently shooting at people at random, wounding several.\nThe motive was under investigation, but Kurz said the possibility that it was an anti-Semitic attack cannot be ruled out, given that the shooting began outside Vienna's main synagogue. The synagogue was closed at the time.\nInterior Minister Karl Nehammer told public broadcaster ORF that the army had been asked to guard key locations in the city to allow police to pursue the gunmen.\nKurz praised police for killing one of the attackers and vowed: \"We will not never allow ourselves to be intimidated by terrorism and will fight these attacks with all means.\"\nVienna Mayor Michael Ludwig said 15 people were hospitalized, seven with serious injuries.\nOskar Deutsch, the head of the Jewish community in Vienna, said it was not clear whether the main synagogue had been targeted.\nRabbi Schlomo Hofmeister said he saw at least one person shoot at people sitting outside at bars in the street below his window.\n\"They were shooting at least 100 rounds just outside our building,\" Hofmeister said.\n\"All these bars have tables outside. This evening is the last evening before the lockdown,\" he added. \"As of midnight, all bars and restaurants will be closed in Austria for the next month, and a lot of people probably wanted to use that evening to be able to go out.\"\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron tweeted that the French \"share the shock and grief of the Austrian people hit by an attack tonight.\"\n\"After France, this is a friendly country that has been attacked. This is our Europe. ... We will not give in,\" he wrote.\nFrance has endured three attacks blamed on Muslim extremists in recent weeks: the wounding of two people outside satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo's old headquarters; the beheading of a schoolteacher who showed students caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad; and a deadly knife attack Thursday in a church in the Mediterranean city of Nice.\nAll of the attacks were strongly condemned at the time by Austria's chancellor.\nAuthorities in Vienna urged people to avoid open spaces and public transportation. Police said trams and buses weren't stopping and urged social media users not to post videos of the police operation so as not to endanger officers.\n\nLoad-Date: November 3, 2020"
