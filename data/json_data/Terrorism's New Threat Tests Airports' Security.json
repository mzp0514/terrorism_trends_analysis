    "full text": "With each fresh eruption of terrorism in the United States this year -- the car-bomb explosion at the World Trade Center in February, the bombing plot aimed at the United Nations and the Hudson River tunnels -- the nation's major airports have gone on security alert.\nSome parking lots have been closed, metal detectors have sprouted just inside terminal doors and unattended cars parked at terminals have been quickly towed away and inspected for explosives.\nWhile most airport officials, airlines and security companies decline to discuss security measures, those in a position to know say the heightened security will continue through the summer, when about 130 million Americans are expected to fly. Especially at the big international airports, there will be more questioning of more passengers, more pat-downs, more surveillance by metal detectors and more searches of carry-on luggage.\nYet some aviation security experts worry that the current security system, installed 20 years ago to thwart hijacking, may not be adequate against a growing terrorist threat.\n \nSystem Has Worked\n There is not much doubt that the system, including the Federal law adopted in 1973 requiring passengers to pass through metal detectors, have worked well. From a record 40 hijackings in 1969, there have been only two in this country since 1990, none since 1991.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration, which sets security regulations for air travel, said one billion people made their way through the nation's airports last year, with 2,353 firearms and 15 explosive devices being confiscated and 1,337 people arrested.\nExperts agree that the security measures at American airports are more stringent than those at foreign airports. \"Although the image is that Europeans really know about security because they've had to cope with terrorism,\" said Neil Monroe, a spokesman for Delta Air Lines, \"American carriers operate under much higher security standards.\"\nAfter three days of undercover tests, the Conde Nast Traveler concluded in its July issue that security remained lax at Frankfurt International Airport in Germany, just months after a hijacker forced a Lufthansa jet en route to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to fly to New York.\n\"Carry-on baggage screeners repeatedly failed to make the basic checks needed to deter terrorism and insure passenger safety,\" the magazine reported.\n \nPraise From Many\n Tommy Stadler of Houston, the former director of security for Continental Airlines, helped in the magazine's investigation. Like other consultants, he said the security programs required by the aviation administration at American airports were \"the best in the world.\"\nOther analysts say the system's weak link is the screeners, most of them employed by security companies hired by individual airlines. Though not highly paid, they have important, but boring, jobs.\nNevertheless, Peter Savage, author of \"The Safe Travel Book\" (Lexington Books, 1989) said he was \"comfortable with the level of security at U.S. airports, and I don't see any grave threats.\" He added that he would avoid the airports in Frankfurt and Athens.\nNor does the Air Line Pilots Association envision any problem. \"Our pilots basically trust the system as it's operating now,\" said David Mallino, a spokesman for the group.\nBut Louis R. Mizell Jr., an expert in international security and crime, said he doubted that the system merited the accolades it received. \"If the system's working,\" he asked, \"why have there been thousands of serious criminal incidents -- many of which have been perpetrated by airline employees, including murders and theft of millions of dollars of passengers' property every year?\"\n \nSwitch to Explosives\n Another security expert, Billie Vincent, who was director of the aviation administration's Office of Civil Aviation from 1982 to 1986, agreed that assurances about safety were misplaced.\n\"What the arrests in New York showed is that the weapon of choice around the world is explosives, because you can kill bunches of people without having to be present,\" he said. \"And terrorists no longer have to worry about moving weapons and explosives to the U.S. They're available here, and as the sophistication of the terrorists' devices increases, our vulnerability is a cause for concern.\"\nA spokesman for the aviation administration said the agency did not talk about specific security measures, because it considered them \"a primer for those people interested in piercing the network.\" The spokesman, Bob Buckhorn, described the security system as a whole as \"very efficient,\" and added, \"We're constantly improving it, closing holes in the network so that it's capable of meeting any threat.\"\nBut Mr. Vincent said more airports should adopt measures like those at San Francisco International Airport, among them bomb-sniffing dogs. The nine dogs circulate throughout the airport, and are tested periodically to see if they can sniff out a bag with plastic explosives sent along a conveyor belt with hundreds of other pieces of luggage.\n\"For the last 10 years,\" Mr. Vincent said of the San Francisco airport, \"they have been probably the most aggressive and forward-looking.\"\nThe airport is also installing its second $1 million thermal neutron analysis system, a machine the size of a small tractor-trailer truck that can detect all known military and commercial explosives. The machine is housed in a glass-enclosed room in the airport's international terminal departure lobby, and the luggage passes through on a conveyer belt.\nOwned by the F.A.A., the machine is used to screen luggage on international flights. The two in San Francisco are the only ones in use in the United States, although others have been tested in New York, Miami and Dulles International Airport in Washington.\nThe reason that there are no more, airline officials say, is that the agency is experimenting with cheaper technologies it hopes will perform as well, and thus is reluctant to buy such expensive machines for the 17 or 18 major airports in the United States.\n\"The dogs and that piece of equipment are enhancements of our security,\" said Ron Wilson, the San Francisco airport's director of public affairs.  \"And they help raise the passengers' confidence level.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPhoto: At San Francisco International Airport, bomb-sniffing dogs are one of the many measures employed in an increased security alert.
