    "full text": "CIA and FBI agents hunting for al-Qaida militants in the Horn of Africa have been interrogating terrorism suspects from 19 countries held at secret prisons in Ethiopia, which is notorious for torture and abuse, according to an investigation by The Associated Press.\nHuman rights groups, lawyers and several Western diplomats assert that hundreds of prisoners, who include women and children, have been transferred secretly and illegally in recent months from Kenya and Somalia to Ethiopia, where they are kept without charge or access to lawyers and families.\nThe detainees include at least one U.S. citizen, and some are from Canada, Sweden and France, according to a list compiled by a Kenyan Muslim rights group and flight manifests obtained by the AP.\nSome were swept up by Ethiopian troops that drove a radical Islamist government out of neighboring Somalia late last year. Others have been deported from Kenya, where many Somalis have fled the continuing violence in their homeland.\nEthiopia, which denies holding secret prisoners, is a country with a long history of human rights abuses. In recent years, it has also been a key U.S. ally in the fight against al-Qaida, which has been trying to sink roots among Muslims in the Horn of Africa.\nU.S. government officials contacted by the AP acknowledged questioning prisoners in Ethiopia. But they said U.S. agents were following the law and were fully justified in their actions because they are investigating past attacks and current threats of terrorism.\nThe prisoners were never in U.S. custody, said FBI spokesman Richard Kolko, who denied that the agency would support or be party to illegal arrests. He said U.S. agents were allowed limited access by governments in the Horn of Africa to question prisoners as part of the FBI's counter-terrorism work.\nWestern security officials, who insisted on anonymity because the issue related to security matters, told the AP that among those held were well-known suspects with strong links to al-Qaida.\nBut some U.S. allies have expressed consternation at the transfers to the prisons. And John Sifton, a Human Rights Watch expert on counter-terrorism said in an e-mail that the United States has acted as a \"ringleader\" in what he labeled a \"decentralized, outsourced Guantanamo.\"\nDetails of the arrests, transfers and interrogations slowly emerged as the AP and human rights groups investigated the disappearances, diplomats tracked their missing citizens and the first released detainees told their stories.\nMore than 100 of the detainees, for example, were originally arrested in Kenya in January, after almost all of them fled Somalia because of the intervention by Ethiopian troops accompanied by U.S. special forces advisers, according to Kenyan police reports and U.S. military officials. Those people were then deported in clandestine pre-dawn flights to Somalia, according to the Kenya Muslim Human Rights Forum and airline documents. At least 19 were women, and 15 were children. In Somalia, they were handed over to Ethiopian intelligence officers and secretly flown to Ethiopia, where they are now in detention, the New York-based Human Rights Watch says.\n\nLoad-Date: April 4, 2007"
