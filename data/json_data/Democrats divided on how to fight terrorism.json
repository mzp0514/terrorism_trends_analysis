The shootings came soon after the terrorist group claimed responsibility for killing more than 100 people in Paris.\nSanders and Martin O'Malley hope to convince increasingly liberal primary voters that Clinton does not fit in the Democratic Party on the issue. It was the same strategy that Barack Obama used to defeat Clinton in 2008.\nRank and file Democrats remain more skeptical about the use of force than the country as a whole. In a recent poll by Quinnipiac University, for example, the country overall favored the use of U.S. ground forces to fight Islamic State in Iraq and Syria by 54 percent to 41 percent. Republicans favored ground forces by 71-23, independents by 53-42. But Democrats opposed it by 56-39.\nAs senator from New York, Clinton voted in 2002 to authorize military force against Iraq, but later admitted she was wrong. As member of the House, Sanders voted against it, saying that he was worried about the \"problems of so-called unintended consequences.\"\nNow, their party's two leading contenders for president differ on how to combat Islamic State, and even whether that should be the first priority.\nClinton, a former secretary of state, calls for a no-fly zone in Syria, which is supported by some Republican presidential candidates and opposed by Obama and others who say the proposal is risky, costly and could lead to confrontations with Russia and Iran.\nSanders, an independent senator from Vermont, opposes a no-fly zone, which he said could get the United States more deeply involved in Syria's civil war.\nClinton supports Obama's recent decision to send a small contingent of special operations forces to Syria to fight Islamic State, even if the deployment grows.\nSanders has concerns that the decision could further draw the United States into a never-ending war.\nSanders also accused Clinton of supporting overthrowing dictators, only to leave vulnerable nations behind, including Iraq, Libya and Syria. He said he prefers putting together broad coalitions, having others lead the fight, so as to not leave a political vacuum that could be filled by terrorists, even if that takes time.\nClinton shot back at Sanders and a moderator who asked if she was partly responsible for the continued chaos in Libya after the United States helped topple dictator Moammar Gadhafi, saying the United States did as much as the Libyans would allow.\nClinton said it's important to combat both Islamic State, also known as ISIS, and Syrian leader Bashar Assad, who is bombing Syrians in the country's civil war.\n\"We will not get the support on the ground in Syria to dislodge ISIS if the fighters there who are not associated with ISIS but whose principal goal of getting rid of Assad don't believe there is a political, diplomatic channel that is ongoing,\" she said.\nSanders countered that Assad's fate should be secondary to fighting Islamic State. \"We have got to get our foreign policies and priorities right,\" he said. \"It is not Assad who is attacking the United States. It is ISIS.\"\nJohn Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman, said after the debate that Clinton's willingness to use all the tools at the U.S.'s disposal, including diplomacy, will help Clinton, not hurt her, in the primaries.\n\"The American public and primary voters are looking for someone who understands the world,\" he said. \"I think she just demonstrated a much more expansive knowledge of the region, had much clearer ideas about what to do in the region. So I think it's a strength for us, not a weakness.\"\n___\n(c)2015 McClatchy Washington Bureau\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n\nLoad-Date: December 22, 2015"
