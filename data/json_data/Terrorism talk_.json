Nine others died in a botched attempt by German police to free the hostages. Five of the eight terrorists and a German policeman were killed as well.\nDefending New Mexico:An Atlanta comedian wants to make amends for the Olympic ticket agents who apparently missed news of New Mexico's statehood.\nBob Romano has converted his home into the Unofficial Consulate of New Mexico, complete with flags and posters from the state's tourism office.\n\"I think there's been a lot of negativity surrounding the Olympics,\" Romano said. \"This is just something light.\"\nA ticket agent told Wade Miller of Santa Fe in February that she could not sell him volleyball tickets because he lived outside the United States. When Miller insisted New Mexico had been a state since 1912, the agent's supervisor suggested he contact the Mexican or Puerto Rican Olympic committees for tickets. Miller eventually got tickets at an Arizona address.\nTo ensure Miller gets a seat at the Games, Romano said he bought him two Olympic baseball tickets. Romano plans to invite visitors to his \"consulate\" to sign a petition supporting New Mexico statehood.\n\nLoad-Date: July 11, 1996"
