    "full text": "Sorry, Gov. Herbert. Protesting the arrogant unrighteous Utah Republican Legislature is not borderline terrorism.\nThe underhanded, last-minute takeover of a sovereign city to build a massive “inland port” facility to make money for Republican developers is terrorism.\nThe increased pollution and deteriation of the quality of life of citizens to operate this “port,” all to line the pockets of legislators and their friends, is terrorism.\nClosing the prison at great cost, and at great inconvenience to thousands of people, to make land available for Republican developers is terrorism.\nRejecting the wishes of the people who voted for three propositions in the last election is terrorism. Those are only a few of the recent terrorist acts perpetrated on Utah citizens by Republicans.\nRepublicans have learned that Utah people are stupid enough to keep electing you terrorists because you have an (R) and the right religion behind your name. Maybe someday they will wake up to see that most Republican legislators don’t “represent” the people who elect them, they represent their own self-interests. It’s all about the money. Only then will the terrorism stop.\nIn the meantime, godspeed and thanks to the protestors.\nBill Miller, Salt Lake City\nSubmit a letter to the editor\n\nLoad-Date: July 20, 2019"
