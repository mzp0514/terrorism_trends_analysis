General Assembly to discuss terrorism after the Sept. 11 attacks against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.\nPakistan, which has pledged support for the U.S. campaign to punish Osama bin Laden and his network, blamed by Washington for the attacks, also warned that the West must do more to eliminate world poverty, which it said breeds extremists.\nDiplomats from Yemen, Sudan, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, as well as the Palestinian envoy, endorsed a new Security Council resolution requiring all 189 U.N. member states to stop giving money, support or sanctuary to terrorists.\nThe U.S. ambassador, John Negroponte, said he was pleased by the show of solidarity with the United States.\n\"I just feel there's overwhelming support for the actions the General Assembly and the Security Council have taken, and I think we see that momentum carrying forward into the General Assembly debate,\" Negroponte said.\nThe 22-member Arab Group, chaired by Libya's U.N. Ambassador Abuzed Omar Dorda, supported international efforts to eliminate terrorism but said it wanted an end to the \"terrorism practiced by (Israeli) occupation forces\" against Palestinians, Lebanese and Syrians.\n\nLoad-Date: October 3, 2001"
