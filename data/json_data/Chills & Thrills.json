    "full text": "The new novel from Karin Slaughter ,\nThe Last Widow (William Morrow, Aug. 20), $28 , does what all great Slaughter books do: keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's a chilling whodunit for our times (extremism! terrorism!) set in Atlanta and featuring returning reader favorites: medical examiner Sara Linton and her partner Will Trent, an investigator with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Go to Parade.com/slaughter for an interview with the author.\nHere, Slaughter shares with\nParade what she's been reading.\nWe Are All Good People Here (Atria Books), $27 , by Susan Rebecca White \"Few books capture the zeitgeist the way this one does. It's a riveting look at the way the past can carve out complications that only become evident with the passage of time.\"\nThe Better Sister (Harper), $27 , by Alafair Burke \"In addition to being a gripping thriller, this is a poignant look at the lives of two very different sisters-and how seemingly inconsequential events can often bring about great sacrifices. Burke gets better with each new read.\"\nTheir Little Secret (Atlantic Monthly Press), $26 , by Mark Billingham \"This is the latest entry in the Tom Thorne series, but it reads as pacey and exciting as the first. I love how the reader knows more about the crime than the detectives.\"\nAvailable in bookstores and online\n\nLoad-Date: August 18, 2019"
