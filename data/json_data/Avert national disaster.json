    "full text": "Ending a war without end is far more important than the Iraq situation discussed in Harold Myerson's June 27 op-ed titled, \"Bush needs anti-war movement.\" The current \"war on terrorism\" could become a national disaster of awful proportions.\nConsidering that terrorism has existed for centuries, it undoubtedly will continue indefinitely. Thus, the war on terrorism is a war without end or limited place. In fact, the present war on terrorism has significantly increased the threats the nation faces.\nThis is a terrible situation that must, and can, be corrected.\nSo, what can be done? First, the people of this nation must be fully informed about the impending situation, and as free as possible of political interests and distortions. This should bring about a massive popular appeal for corrective action. Next, Congress should recognize and proclaim that we are conducting a \"campaign against terrorism,\" not a war, and then take appropriate action in a variety of ways.\nAs a result, people should no longer be imprisoned indefinitely without charges or representation. The prospective of pre-emptive strikes should be reduced. The curtailment of civil rights, under the guise of wartime threats, national security, and the like, should be eliminated.\nThese are just a few examples.\nEdward L. Page\nBlue Hill\n\nLoad-Date: July 5, 2005"
