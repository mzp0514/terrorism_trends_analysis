Several of them watched from a rooftop overlooking the town square.\nElizabethtown police Chief Edward Cunningham said his department was aware of the groups’ presence. “We’re obviously keeping an eye on them,” Cunningham said. “As long as they’re being peaceful and following the rules, they have as much of a right as everyone else.”\nChristopher LaFrance, 30, of Avondale, Chester County, identified himself as Carlisle Light Infantry’s first sergeant. He said borough businesses requested the “apolitical” group for protection.\nDan McCorkel, 49, of Carlisle, Cumberland County, said the group was organized in 1784 and has never disbanded. He added that the militia participated in the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794.\nThree other men who identified themselves as Carlisle Light Infantry members were parked in an alley near the protest site. Jay, who declined to give his last name, said the Domestic Terrorism Response Organization has 300 members in central Pennsylvania and is dedicated to protecting businesses, citizens and homes.\nHe said he was 30 years old and an Elizabethtown resident.\nLNP | LancasterOnline surveyed five businesses and Cunningham but could not determine if the two organizations were asked to attend the protest.\nLNP's live video of the ongoing protest in Elizabethtown:\nLNP correspondent John Duffy contributed to this report.\nLive tweets from the scene\n\nLoad-Date: August 11, 2020"
