They are real. And they are lethal. We must take action. We simply have no choice.\"\nThose threats now include militant nationalism, weapons of mass destruction, the proliferation of ballistic missile technology and terrorism.\nNATO planners believe the key to a comprehensive anti-terrorism strategy is to forge stronger ties with Moscow, including an institutionalized relationship which some describe as a form of \"associate NATO membership\" for Russia.\nNATO officials hope to wrap up an agreement by May 14 when NATO foreign ministers meet in Reykjavik, Iceland. President Vladimir Putin is to join NATO leaders in Rome two weeks later to seal the deal.\nThe advantages of Russian cooperation became clear after Sept. 11, when the Russians shared intelligence on international threat groups and smoothed the way for U.S. troops to move into former Soviet republics of Central Asia to support the war in Afghanistan.\nNATO planners foresee some sort of arrangement in which the Russians would join alliance members as an equal partner to devise a common strategy for fighting terrorism and combatting the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.\nThat could in turn lead to joint programs in such areas as peacekeeping, arms control, civil emergency planning, disaster relief and even joint missile defense.\nA new relationship with NATO also would soothe Moscow's unease over alliance plans to offer membership to former pro-Soviet states of eastern Europe, particularly Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. All three used to be part of the Soviet Union.\nDuring the Nov. 21-22 summit in Prague, NATO is expected to send membership invitations to selected eastern European countries. In addition to the three Baltic countries, NATO officials are considering offering membership to Slovenia, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria in an expansion that will take the alliance's frontiers to within a few hundred miles of Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\"We must take on new members, securing freedom from the Baltic to the Black Sea,\" President Bush said at a recent White House meeting with Robertson.\nIncreasingly, NATO officials feel problems of corruption, military backwardness or political instability in some of the candidates are outweighed by the advantages of bringing them into the fold.\nRomania and Bulgaria, for example, could offer the alliance a bulwark in the volatile Balkans.\n\"The creation of a joint defense area is of crucial importance for the promotion of security in Europe's southeastern flank,\" Greek Defense Minister Yannos Papantoniou said. \"We face common threats.\"\nAt the same time, alliance officials say NATO must address the imbalance in military power between the United States and its NATO partners.\n\"Many militaries in Europe remain organized, trained and equipped just as they were in the latter half of the previous century,\" Air Force Gen. Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote in the April edition of Britain's Royal United Services Institute Journal.\n\"In terms of providing a real improvement in fighting capabilities for European members … not much as been accomplished.\"\nNATO wants European leaders in Prague to agree to improve their capabilities against threats from nuclear, chemical or biological weapons; enhance their precision guided munitions; build up their fleets of transport planes to move troops quickly; and improve communications, surveillance and intelligence.\nThat could be difficult for European governments, which have been reluctant to divert resources from social welfare systems to their militaries.\nLord Robertson has warned, however, that failure to do so could have severe political repercussions.\n\"If we do not develop our capabilities … how will we explain to our publics if the next major terrorist attack uses microscopic germs instead of massive jetliners and we are unable to respond?\" Robertson said.\n\nLoad-Date: May 2, 2002"
