    "full text": "UNITED NATIONS - Insisting he wasn't making a threat, Pakistan's leader denounced his Indian counterpart on Friday and warned that any war between the nuclear rivals could \"have consequences for the world.\" India's prime minister took the opposite approach, skipping any mention at the United Nations of his government's crackdown in the disputed region of Kashmir.\n\"When a nuclear-armed country fights to the end, it will have consequences far beyond the borders. It will have consequences for the world,\" Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan said in a wide-ranging, at times apparently extemporaneous U.N. General Assembly speech in which he called Modi's actions in Kashmir \"stupid\" and \"cruel.\"\n\"That's not a threat,\" he said of his war comments. \"It's a fair worry. Where are we headed?\"\nAn hour earlier, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the U.N. meeting with a speech that focused primarily on his country's development, though he warned of the spreading specter of terrorism. He never mentioned Kashmir directly.\nMeanwhile, North Korea accused the United States on Friday of failing to follow through on summit agreements between President Donald Trump and the country's leader, Kim Jong Un, but said it is placing hope in Trump's \"wise option and bold decision.\"\n\nLoad-Date: November 3, 2019"
