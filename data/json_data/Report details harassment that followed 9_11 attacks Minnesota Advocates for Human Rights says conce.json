Racial and religious stereotyping continues to this day, as do overt acts of discrimination, the report said.\nThe 94-page report was based on interviews with more than 100 Minnesota immigrants. The events of 9/11 fueled changes in public attitudes toward national security and immigration that continue today, it said. Those changes were also aggravated by subsequent political campaigns targeting immigrants and the public debate over immigration reform, the report said.\n\"This was not meant to be a scientific study, but to detail history and real life experiences,'' said Robin Phillips, executive director of Minnesota Advocates for Human Rights. \"We want to make sure that history and experience is included in the public policy dialogue.''\nMukherjee, who spoke at a news conference Thursday announcing the report, was most exasperated by how he was constantly pulled from airport lines during \"random'' passenger checks. Once, after being released from one interview, he was pulled out of line again, less than an hour later.\nThe Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Transportation Security Administration, has a policy strongly discouraging racial or ethnic profiling in law enforcement activities.\nBut immigrants are also targeted in unofficial ways, Mukherjee said. He recalled trying to get a receipt from a tow truck operator in Uptown last year. He said the operator yelled at him, \"Why don't you first give me a receipt from the World Trade Center?''\nJaafar-Mohammed, meanwhile, said she and her husband had looked forward to their first home together in Woodbury. But the harassment from their neighbor reached the point that she feared for her safety. The Minneapolis attorney said she obtained a restraining order last year on the man, who eventually left their suburban neighborhood.\nHarassment aside, federal policies to contain terrorism also continue to leave their mark, the report said. For example, some Muslims continue to worry whether their charitable donations to Islamic organizations could be construed as \"material support'' to terrorists groups, which is prohibited by the Patriot Act. Islam requires its followers to donate 2.5 percent of their savings to charity.\nSeveral incidents of alleged misconduct by the FBI are mentioned in the report. A Somali man employed by a Twin Cities school district says he received a visit from the FBI at his home a day after he inquired about bus rentals for a school event. One of the questions he was asked; \"What do you think of Saddam Hussein?''\nFBI spokesman Paul McCabe said he had not been informed about the incidents mentioned in the report, and that they would be impossible to verify without names, dates and places. The authors of report, however, offered confidentiality to those they interviewed.\nIf people have concerns about the FBI, they should contact the FBI or a trusted community organization, he said. \"We will investigate,'' McCabe said.\nPhillips said that the Minnesota Advocates is interested in learning about other experiences - good and bad - resulting from Sept. 11.
