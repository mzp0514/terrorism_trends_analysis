Mr. Nkomo's support is concentrated in the province.\nMr. Nkomo and his Zimbabwe African People's Union party have denied involvement in insurgent activities. Independent church and welfare organizations and Mr. Nkomo's party have accused the Fifth Brigade of terrorism throughout Matabeleland, killing and maiming hundreds of civilians.\nOther informants, including churchworkers and white Members of Parliament, have said trouble is increasing again in Matabeleland."
