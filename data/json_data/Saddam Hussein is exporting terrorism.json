He swore personal revenge upon President George H.W. Bush. After the Gulf War, Iraqi terrorists came close to assassinating Bush with a car bomb when he visited Kuwait.\nIn 1993, when the first World Trade Center bombing took place, the Islamic terrorist Ramzi Yousef used an Iraqi passport to enter America, his accomplice who made the huge bomb escaped to Iraq and allegedly lives there.\nRemember the two U.S. Embassy bombings in 1998, one in Kenya and one in Tanzania, and the October 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen.\nThere is no doubt that Iraq has been using bin Laden's terrorists to attack America.\nOne reason why a lot of intelligence is not released is because of fear and panic it would cause.\nThere is no smoking gun. Just add up the facts!\nCharlie Faltermayer,\nNew Providence\n\nLoad-Date: February 12, 2003"
