    "full text": "Parliament gave British police unprecedented new powers Wednesday to stop and frisk people on the streets in the interests of combating terrorism.\nThe government sought the legislation and rushed it through in a day, citing fears of Irish Republican Army terrorism over Easter.\nA Washington Post Report\nThe law allows police to stop, frisk and search anyone anywhere they designate, without necessarily having grounds for suspicion. A person declining to be searched can be arrested, jailed or fined.\nThe measure extends to police throughout Britain special powers previously confined to law enforcement authorities in Northern Ireland, where most terrorist acts have occurred during the province's 25 years of sectarian violence.\nBritain, unlike the United States, has no bill of rights restricting the government's legislative authority in matters concerning civil liberties.\nThe IRA ended a 17-month cease-fire in February with a bomb attack on London's Docklands development.\nWhile negotiations continue between the government and Protestant and Catholic political leaders in Northern Ireland for a permanent end to the violence, the government remains on alert for further terrorist acts, particularly this Easter, the 80th anniversary of the 1916 rebellion against British rule in Ireland known as the Easter Rising.\n\nLoad-Date: April 6, 1996"
