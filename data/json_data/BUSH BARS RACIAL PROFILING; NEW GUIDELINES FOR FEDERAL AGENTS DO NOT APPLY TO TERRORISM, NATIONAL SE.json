    "full text": "President Bush issued guidelines yesterday barring federal agents from using race or ethnicity in their routine investigations.\n But the policy carves out clear exemptions for investigations involving terrorism and national security matters.\n The policy governs the conduct of 70 federal law enforcement agencies. A narcotics agent, for instance, cannot focus on a specific neighborhood simply because of its racial make-up, the policy states.\nIn national security operations, however, the policy allows agents to use race and ethnicity in \"narrow\" circumstances to help \"identify terrorist threats and stop potential catastrophic attacks,\" officials said.\n Immigration officials, for instance, will continue to be able to require visitors from largely Middle Eastern countries to register with the government. And if intelligence officials had information indicating that terrorists of a certain ethnic group planned to hijack a plane next week in California, authorities could impose \"heightened scrutiny\" on men of that ethnicity who boarded area planes in that area, officials said.\n Arab-American and civil rights groups said that the loopholes in the White House policy would give the authorities legal justification to single out Middle Easterners and others who may fall under suspicion, and they questioned whether the new policy -- issued as \"guidance\" -- would be aggressively enforced.\n \"This policy acknowledges racial profiling as a national concern, but it does nothing to stop it,\" Laura Murphy, director of the Washington office of the American Civil Liberties Union, said in an interview. \"It's largely a rhetorical statement. The administration is trying to soften its image, but it's smoke and mirrors.\"\n The final report from the Justice Department and the policy recommendations were delivered last week to the president, who ordered the restrictions adopted across the federal government, the White House said.\n The Justice Department, in a survey of federal operations, concluded in its report that profiling did not appear to be \"a systemic problem.\"\n \"The way the president looks at it,\" a White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, said, \"this is about stopping the abuses of a few, and the action yesterday should only strengthen the public's confidence that the vast majority of law enforcement officials have earned and deserve credit for the job they do in protecting Americans.\"\n Ralph Boyd, an assistant attorney general at the Justice Department who runs the civil rights division, said the over-arching theme of the guidelines is that law enforcement officials cannot use race or ethnicity \"as a proxy\" to focus increased criminal suspicion on a person.\n \"This is an anti-stereotyping guidance,\" aimed at balancing the civil rights of the public against the legitimate needs of law enforcement, Boyd said.\n The policy lays out two distinct sets of guidelines: a broad prohibition on profiling in traditional and often routine law enforcement investigations; and a looser set of standards for national security cases.\n In traditional operations like traffic stops, federal agents \"may not use race or ethnicity to any degree, except that officers may rely on race and ethnicity in a specific suspect description,\" the policy states. Officials said this prohibition was intended to go beyond the safeguards of the Constitution and existing law.\n In investigations involving national security and border integrity, the new policy adopts a lower standard, saying federal agents \"may consider race, ethnicity and other relevant factors to the extent permitted by our laws and the Constitution.\"\n The racial information that the authorities can use in such cases does not have to be very specific.\n The policy notes that because terrorists have the ability to strike almost anywhere, \"there can be no expectation that the information must be specific to a particular locale or even to a particular identified scheme.\"\n Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the new policy would do little to mollify Arab-Americans.\n \"There seem to be a lot of 'buts' and 'howevers' here that would allow profiling of Arabs and Muslims to continue,\" Hooper said.\n\nLoad-Date: June 19, 2003"
