''We will fight it in a different way.''\n''There are no good solutions,'' in Lebanon, he said, ''only less bad solutions, less evil solutions.''\nHe spoke to the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations at 515 Park Avenue, betweem 59th and 60th Streets.\nThe Israeli Government has said it will withdraw its forces from Lebanon in three stages, the first of which is scheduled to start Feb. 18. Mr. Rabin said yesterday that if that step ''leads to havoc, bloodshed, massacres, it will be the responsibility of the Lebanese Government.''\n''No one will blame us,'' he said.\nMr. Rabin said Israel would leave a Lebanon that was in many ways worse off than it was when Israel invaded in June 1982. He said that Syria now controlled Lebanon and that terrorism by Shiite Moslems was a major threat.\nMr. Rabin said he hoped most of the Shiites in Lebanon were not sympathetic to the terrorists who bombed the United States Embassy and Marine compound.  The Shiite terrorists, he said, are worse than the Palestine Liberation Organization."
