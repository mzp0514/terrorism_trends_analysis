Mueller 3d.\nFedarcyk was posted to Philadelphia two years ago. She has wide experience in terrorism investigations, and oversaw inquiries into the exploitation of children, Mueller said in a statement. \"She is well-prepared to lead our largest office.\"\nIn an interview, Fedarcyk praised the work of this region's agents, and added, \"I'm just thrilled\" to take over the New York office, where she will oversee the \"full spectrum\" of FBI work.\nShe became an agent in 1987 and was assigned to Los Angeles. In 1996, Fedarcyk was promoted to FBI headquarters, where she coordinated reaction to domestic and international crises. In 2003, she was selected as the assistant section chief of the Terrorist Financing Operations Section of the Counterterrorism Division.\nIn 2005, she became the FBI's representative to the National Counterterrorism Center, Directorate of Strategic Operational Planning.\nIn Philadelphia, FBI agents under Fedarcyk have investigated several terrorism-related cases, including alleged attempted arms-smuggling by Hezbollah. Most famously, a Bucks County woman, Colleen LaRose, or \"JihadJane,\" was charged in connection with an alleged plot to kill a Swedish artist whose drawing of the head of Muhammad on a dog's body generated numerous death threats.\nFedarcyk, 52, will start work in New York in August.\nContact staff writer Nathan Gorenstein at 215-854-2797 or ngorenstein@phillynews.com.\n\nLoad-Date: June 26, 2010"
