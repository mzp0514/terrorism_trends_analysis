    "full text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. – The federal government last week reauthorized for the next six years the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, which allows the government to pay for most losses above $200 million that are suffered by commercial businesses as a result of any terrorist attacks.\nThe program, which was created about a year after 9/11, expired at the end of 2014, and its reauthorization has put commercial insurance companies, particularly those representing property owners in large cities, back at ease.\n“We commend and congratulate the Members of Congress who gave their overwhelming support to renew the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA),” said the Commercial Real Estate and Development Association in a statement on its website. “This bipartisan legislation will ensure the commercial real estate development industry can continue to provide good jobs and economic growth for America. ”\nThe expiration of the bill prompted an impassioned response from New York City commercial property owners. About 750,000 private insurance policies were canceled within the first few days of the new year, citing TRIA – and subsequently the lack of federal aid in case of terrorist attacks – as the reason, the New York Times reported.\nThe bill passed the House and the Senate by overwhelming margins, and President Barack Obama signed it into law Jan. 12.\nhttp://www.mecktimes.com/be-the-first-to-know/ Click here for more from this resource.\n© 2015 Dolan Media Newswires.
