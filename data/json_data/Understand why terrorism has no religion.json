With no mention of religion or nationality, the word \"terrorism\" does not apply as a description to anyone or anything other than those involved in perpetrating acts of terror.\nFriday's attacks on Paris are heartbreaking and an outpouring of support is what should be expected as the shock of needless violence begins to sink in. Every time the death toll rose, it felt like a punch in the gut. Of course, people are experiencing fear, sorrow and anger, but not one of these is an excuse to express hatred toward another person for their religious background.\nWhen I read comments on news articles, cringe at social media posts or overhear conversations on public transportation, I still hear an extension of the terror itself. Americans uttering anti-Muslim words and using Islam as a synonym for terrorism is uneducated, disappointing and racist.\nActing on a lack of knowledge about different cultures and religions extends the hatred and violence of actual terrorists. Think about the goals of a terrorist - to hurt people, to scare them, to incite chaos, to lessen the shock of violence, to make hatred common.\n1. Let's all try to remember, amidst pain and fear, that terrorism has no religion. Extremism is a brand of madness, not faith.\nThis is the desire of a limited number of extremists, no one else. So, when we allow the people next to us on the light rail train to make a racist comment, we are legitimizing their ridiculous notions.\nWhat many fail to realize is that Islam is a faith based on many of the exact same ideals as Christianity. Here are a few similarities:\nNow, let me list a few differences:\nNeither faith is based on violence, condones terrorism or desires a world without peace. It is a fundamental failure on the part of modern education not to teach the beliefs of many religions and it is unfortunate that so many Americans lack the understanding of any culture but their own.\nMuslims are just as much the victims of these acts as any other religion, country or group. Followers of Islam are subject to the exact same fear anyone felt upon hearing news of the attacks on Paris. Hatred of a faith or stereotyping a culture as inherently bad is carrying that initial horror further. These horrific acts should bring us closer together and call for more understanding and action in preventing future violence.\nMy niece's first response to the Paris attacks: \"should I tell people at school I'm not Muslim anymore?\"She is seven. SEVEN.\nTerrorism is an attack on society, on establishment and on safety. The people responsible for it lose their credibility as anything other than monsters the moment they agree to hurt someone. They are no longer members who can represent their religion or citizens who can speak for their country. Terrorists' actions no longer reflect their cultures or traditions because they are choosing to abandon them.\nThere are 7.38 billion people living on this planet. The two largest religious groups are Christianity and Islam, making up more than half of the total population. So, before you speak or accept the stereotypes perpetrated by the confused and uneducated, remember that the goal of terrorism is to make you hateful out of fear.
