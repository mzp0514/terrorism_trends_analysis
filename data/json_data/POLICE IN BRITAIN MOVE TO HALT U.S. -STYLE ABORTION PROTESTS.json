    "full text": "British authorities moved forcefully Tuesday to keep U.S.-style anti-abortion militancy out of the country, arresting the founder of the Rescue America group and stopping a counterdemonstration.\nAnti-abortion activists have firebombed U.S. abortion clinics and harassed women clients, and an abortion opponent has been charged with murdering a doctor outside a clinic in Florida.\nFamily planning workers fear the same could happen in Britain, where abortion has been legal since 1967.\nSurprised by the arrest of their leader, Don Treshman of Houston, anti-abortion protesters from the United States and their British allies called off a demonstration Tuesday outside the London offices of the International Planned Parenthood Federation.\nBut about 60 police officers showed up and arrested about 20 abortion-rights demonstrators intent on confronting the Americans. A few anti-abortion protesters also were arrested.\nRescue America said it would go ahead with protests at British abortion clinics later in the week and would lobby Parliament - with or without Treshman.\nMark Laskin, assistant secretary general of International Planned Parenthood Federation, said family planning groups were consulting authorities about security. \"This is terrorism by tourism,\" he said.\nTreshman was arrested early Tuesday and served with a deportation order.  His attorney, David Brocklesby, said Treshman would challenge the order.\n\nLoad-Date: September 29, 1993"
