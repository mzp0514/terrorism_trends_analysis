Rodino Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, who had been in favor of eliminating the guidelines the bureau says are designed to help it fight domestic terrorism.\nThe compromise language was sent to the House floor as part of the Justice Department's $3.4 billion authorization bill for the fiscal year 1984. The bill was approved by voice vote.\nAttorney General William French Smith issued the guidelines on March 7. One of them would permit the bureau to infiltrate groups in which ''there is not yet a reasonable indication of criminal activities.''\nThe compromise would permit the bureau to use the guidelines through Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year. But from Oct. 1 through Jan. 1, the bureau must revert to previous guidelines that put greater restrictions on agents.\nBefore Jan. 1, Mr. Rodino said, Congress and the bureau would attempt to agree on a new set of rules governing the investigation of groups that come under the guidelines.\nHad the compromise not been reached, Mr. Rodino faced a battle from committee conservatives, led by Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., Republican of Wisconsin, who had wanted the bureau to retain the guidelines."
