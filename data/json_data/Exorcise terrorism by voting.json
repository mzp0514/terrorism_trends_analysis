From General Washington and his troops at Valley Forge to the soldiers who fought at Gettysburg, we can add those in Somerset County who gave their lives to save others in a victory against terrorism.\n#KREIDER.OCTD#We have no idea whose families were spared because of their selfless courage.\nPennsylvania has always had her share of citizens unafraid to risk their lives to protect others. Think of the stops in our state that were a part of the Underground Railroad which ferried slaves to freedom. I am certain there wasn't always time to exchange names or ever meet again those that were sheltered on their way north.  Those citizen patriots made the decision to enlist in the fight to abolish slavery.\nThe patriots on the jet that crashed in Somerset County quickly enlisted in the fight against terrorism. The purpose and ultimate goal of this terrorism is not just to maim and destroy people, but to replace the freedoms of our democratic republic with a regime of fear and hate.\nWhat can we do? Each of us can throw a punch at the cowardly bully of terrorism by making sure we vote in the election on Nov.  6. If you are not registered, there are only a few days left to be eligible to vote this fall. Waving the flag is great; pulling the lever sends a louder message. The message is that remembering the cost of our freedom makes us stronger. If we remember the God who loves and continues to bless us, working to right the wrongs our nation has committed against Him, America will be ready to do battle against terrorism.\nPatricia Kreider\nQuarryville\n\nLoad-Date: October 5, 2001"
