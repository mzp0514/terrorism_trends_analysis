    "full text": "India and Pakistan exchanged angry accusations yesterday over India's claim that its longtime rival had a hand in the hijacking of an Indian Airlines jetliner in which one person was killed.\nReflecting the tensions between the two neighbors, a land-mine explosion killed 17 people and wounded 31 in the disputed region of Kashmir.\nNo one claimed responsibility for the blast in a vegetable market outside Indian-controlled Srinagar, but Muslim separatists often carry out attacks in the region. In Pakistani-held Kashmir, five civilians were killed from repeated Indian shelling, Pakistani officials said.\nIndian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee urged the United States and other world powers to declare Pakistan a terrorist state, saying India had evidence proving Pakistan was involved in the hijacking.\nVajpayee's comments were the latest in a series of strong statements by Indian leaders alleging Pakistani involvement in the hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight 814 on a Dec. 24 flight from Nepal to New Delhi. However, neither Vajpayee nor the other officials have provided evidence to back up their allegations.\nNations that declare Pakistan a terrorist state could impose a range of sanctions against Islamabad.\nPakistan's foreign minister, Abdul Sattar, dismissed the Indian allegations as \"trumped-up charges\" and said India had an \"abhorrent record of state terrorism,\" a reference to its military campaign against Muslim militants in Kashmir.\nThe State Department said it would have to determine that Pakistan had repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism for it to be designated a terrorist state.\n\nLoad-Date: January 30, 2002"
