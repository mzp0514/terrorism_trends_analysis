    "full text": "Robert Kupperman, 71, a government scientist who started warning of terrorist attacks against the United States more than 30 years ago, has died of complications from Parkinson's disease.\nHis daughter, Tamara Kupperman Thorp, said he died Friday at his home in Washington.\n\"Unless governments take basic precautions, we will continue to stand at the edge of an awful abyss,\" Mr. Kupperman, chief scientist for the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, wrote in a 1977 report that summarized nearly five years of work by the Cabinet Committee to Combat Terrorism.\nPresident Richard M. Nixon created the high-level panel in September 1972 after Palestinian commandos slaughtered 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team at the Munich Games.\n\"Terrorists are undergoing a dangerous metamorphosis from technological clods relying on fanaticism to skilled tacticians,\" Mr. Kupperman warned in a 1988 op-ed article in the New York Times, written with journalist Jeff Kamen.\nAfter leaving the government in 1979, he was associated with the private Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\nHe wrote in 1995 that the government had \"essentially ignored the issue of domestic terrorism\" for two decades.\nDavid M. Abshire, a founder of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in an August 2002 letter to Mr. Kupperman that \"we might have prevented 9/11\" had presidents and policymakers listened more closely to him.- AP\n\nLoad-Date: November 27, 2006"
