Why is it any different to provide a communications platform to Hamas, to ISIS?\"\nRelatives of those three victims filed a federal lawsuit against Twitter earlier this month, saying the San Francisco company violated the U.S. Anti-terrorism Act by providing material support to terrorists. It seeks unspecified damages.\nAnother lawsuit filed last year on behalf of five people killed or injured in terror attacks linked to Hamas blames Facebook Inc., saying it provides material support to Hamas.\nSimilar lawsuits across the country have been rejected by the courts on grounds that the companies are protected by the Communications Decency Act, which bars social-networking companies from being sued for speech used by their customers.\nIn court papers, Facebook is fighting back, saying the material support claim is not new and it's been routinely dismissed by the courts.\n\"Facebook has zero tolerance for terrorism,\" the Cupertino, California-based company wrote. \"It condemns terrorist actions, prohibits terrorist content on Facebook, and swiftly removes any reported terrorist content.\"\nTwitter said in a statement that it condemns the use of it services to promote terrorism.\n\"This type of behavior, or any violent threat, is not permitted on our service,\" it said, adding that it has suspended over 360,000 accounts in the last 18 months for promoting violent extremism, primarily related to the Islamic State.\n\nLoad-Date: January 20, 2017"
