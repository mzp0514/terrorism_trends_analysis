They were briefed on the investigation but asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to comment publicly.\nThe two passengers traveling on a United Airlines flight from Chicago were identified as Ahmed Mohamed Nasser al Soofi, 48, a U.S. resident of Yemeni descent, and Hezam al Murisi, 37, of Yemen, who was in the U.S. on a visa, the two law enforcement officials said.\n\"I do not think they had any intentions\" of committing terrorism, Yemen's consul general in Detroit, Abdul-Hakim Al-Sadah, said Tuesday. Al Soofi has lived in the Detroit area.\nAl Murisi's Dutch lawyer, Klaas-Arjen Krikke, said his client \"denies ... adamantly\" any link to terrorism.\nDepartment of Homeland Security spokesman Matthew Chandler said the matter remains \"under investigation but as of right now, these two passengers have not been charged with any crime in the United States, and we caution you against jumping to any conclusions.\"\n\"In this instance, sound judgment led to suspicious items being identified, which triggered automatic security responses by U.S. security personnel,\" Chandler said.\nAl Soofi was carrying $7,000 in cash and had suspicious items in his luggage, including cellphones and watches that had been bound together with tape and another taped bundle of medicine and a cellphone, one of the U.S. law enforcement officials said.\nAl Murisi had missed a flight from Chicago to Yemen and the airline then put him on the same flight as Al Soofi, raising suspicion among investigators, the law enforcement official said.\nThe items, none of which are prohibited, were bound for delivery to individual recipients in Yemen, the law enforcement officials said. They added that the men do not know each other, neither of them is named on any terrorism watch list, and their travel together was coincidental.\nIt was initially thought the items might have been part of a practice run for a future attack, the officials said.\nA statement issued early Tuesday by the office of the Dutch Public Prosecutor said the men were being held on \"suspicion of a conspiracy to a terrorist criminal act.\" But a Dutch official said later that investigators were re-evaluating the inquiry based on information provided by U.S. authorities. The official has been briefed on the inquiry but asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to comment publicly.\nGlen Winn, an aviation security consultant, said security officials were \"right\" to raise questions about the travelers. He said the men should not have been allowed to continue on the flight to Amsterdam until \"all questions were ... resolved.\"\nYemen Embassy spokesman Mohammed Al-Basha said, \"We are working closely with our international partners to hasten the ongoing investigation into yesterday's detainment of two Yemeni passengers.\"\nContributing: Detroit Free Press \n\nLoad-Date: September 1, 2010"
