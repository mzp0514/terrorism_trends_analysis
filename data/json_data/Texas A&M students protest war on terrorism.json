Not everyone is complacent.\"\nYoung and Joy De, a junior veterinarian medicine major, will participate in a march demanding an end to racial profiling, military recruitment, the imprisonment of immigrants and to demanding a foreign policy based on social and economic justice.\nThe protest aims to bring an end to racial profiling and military recruitment targeting minority and working-class youth and to end the degrading and secret imprisonment of immigrants, Young said.\nYoung said he is opposed to the war because he does not believe violence should be used to combat violence. Also, Young said, terrorists are merely responding to America's \"exploitation of the Third World and imperialist policies.\"\n\"We believe [the Bush administration] should solve the root problems with a peaceful end,\" Young said. \"There are reasons why people hate the U.S. It is because of inconsistent intervention and corporate global exploitation.\"\nDe said Bush needs to be more mindful and sensitive to all the perspectives of the American people,and that she is suspicious of the Bush administration's actions. While De is in Washington, she plans to participate in lobbying and activism workshops.\n\"We want to tell Bush our eyes are open,\" De said.\n(C) 2002 The Battalion via U-WIRE\n\nLoad-Date: April 11, 2002"
