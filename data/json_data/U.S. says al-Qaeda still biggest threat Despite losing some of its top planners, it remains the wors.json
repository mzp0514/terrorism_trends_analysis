That is almost a fourfold increase in attacks from 2004, though the agency attributes the change largely on new ways of tallying the incidents.\nAt least 10,000 to 15,000 of the approximately 40,000 people killed or wounded worldwide were Muslims, most of them in Iraq, said the National Counterterrorism Center, which provided statistical information to the State Department.\nAbout 3,500 of last year's attacks occurred in Iraq, and about 8,300 of the deaths occurred there, accounting for a large part of the increase over 2004.\nThe report said that Iraq was not a safe haven for terrorists but that Shiite and Sunni extremist groups were trying to turn it into one. While the United States and its allies have thwarted some attacks and kidnappings by groups such as al-Qaeda in Iraq, led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, \"the battle is far from over,\" it said.\nThe number of victims killed in Israel was less than 50, down from the nearly 100 people killed in 2004, the report said.\nThe report said that Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders were scattered and on the run and that Afghanistan was no longer a safe haven for the network. In addition, al-Qaeda's relations with the Taliban that once ruled Afghanistan are growing weaker and the group's finances and logistics have been disrupted, the report said.\n\"Al-Qaeda is not the organization it was four years ago,\" the report said.\nHowever, \"overall, we are in the first phase of a potentially long war,\" it said. \"The enemy's proven ability to adapt means we will go through several more cycles of action/reaction before the war's outcome is no longer in doubt. It is likely we will have a resilient enemy for years to come.\"\nA new generation of extremists, some of them getting training through the Internet, is emerging in cells that are likely to be more local and less meticulously planned, the report said. These small groups, empowered by technology, are very difficult to detect or counter, it said.\n\"We must maintain unrelenting pressure against al-Qaeda,\" Henry Crumpton, the U.S. ambassador in charge of counterterrorism, said yesterday at a briefing at the State Department. \"We know they aim to attack the U.S. homeland.\"\nSix countries - Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria - remain classified as state sponsors of terrorism. Libya and Sudan, though, were credited with continuing to take significant steps to cooperate in the global war on terrorism.\n\nLoad-Date: April 29, 2006"
