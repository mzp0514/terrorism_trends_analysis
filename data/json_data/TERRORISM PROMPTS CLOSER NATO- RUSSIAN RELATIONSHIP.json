    "full text": "The 19 nations of NATO pledged yesterday to build a closer relationship with Russia. They also acknowledged that the alliance would have to undergo a significant transformation because terrorism -- and fear of it -- had undermined conventional military doctrine and the preparedness of forces to fight unconventional enemies.\n With reports circulating of a split over how deeply Moscow should be allowed into NATO's decision-making, foreign ministers abandoned their previous arrangements for consulting with Russia and promised to bring its leaders into the alliance's innermost councils in a number of situations, including the fight against terror.\nBut the allies apparently skirted the issue of whether Russia would ever have veto power in the alliance, and made little progress on the details of cooperation ahead of meetings today with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.\n \"We are pleased that Russia stands with us in the struggle against terrorism,\" the ministers said in a final communique, \"and we believe this will contribute significantly to our common goal of a strong, stable and enduring NATO-Russia partnership.\"\n The new Danish foreign minister, Per Stig Moeller, said several members feared that a broad embrace of Russia might give Moscow veto authority over key alliance decisions, especially on the sensitive issue of enlargement.\n In 1998 Russia strongly opposed the first wave of NATO expansion toward its borders with the inclusion of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. In November 2002, NATO heads of state are to meet in Prague, Czech Republic, and decide whether nine more nations, including the three Baltic states, which were once Soviet republics, will join the alliance, a step that Moscow also opposes.\n \"They cannot get a veto about enlargement,\" Moeller said. Referring to a proposed council of 20 nations -- 19 NATO members plus Russia -- he added, \"Enlargement will not be decided there.\"\n U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell said yesterday that such a NATO-Russia Council would pursue opportunities for joint action \"where our views converge.\"\n In their initial formulation yesterday, the alliance ministers agreed on expanding their cooperation with Moscow on counterterrorism \"and other areas, including nonproliferation, export control and arms control matters, arms transparency and confidence-building measures, missile defense, search and rescue at sea and military to military cooperation.\"\n But NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson said at a news conference that deeper cooperation with Russia \"will not be at the expense of our fundamental objectives,\" and that the alliance would \"retain our prerogative to undertake independent action.\"\n He added that President Vladimir Putin \"knows this and, of course, accepts it.\" Last month, however, when he was in Moscow, Robertson had said that the question of Russia's veto power was open for discussion.\n The task of more precisely defining a role for the NATO-Russia Council was put off until May, when the ministers meet in Iceland.\n Meanwhile Ivanov, on his way to Brussels, was quoted as saying Russia should become an \"equal partner\" with NATO in a new era of threats and cooperation.\n \"NATO, its aims and tasks have to change to meet the present conditions,\" he said in remarks quoted by the Russian news agency Interfax. \"Otherwise the alliance will remain a structure not corresponding with the present situation.\"\n\nNotes\n\nTHE WAR ON TERROR\n\nLoad-Date: December 7, 2001"
