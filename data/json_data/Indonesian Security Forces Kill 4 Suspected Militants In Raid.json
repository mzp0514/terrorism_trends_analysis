Three other alleged militants also were captured.\nCounter-terrorism troops tracked the seven suspects to a hideout and sealed off the area in a suburb of Solo city in Central Java late on Wednesday. The raid ended around daybreak following an explosion inside the house. Indonesian television showed footage of a burnt-out house, with no roof and blown-out walls.\nA counter-terrorism official said the dead included alleged bomb-maker Bagus Budi Pranato, alias Urwah, wanted by police in connection with the hotel bombings. The captured militants included a pregnant woman who was being treated at a local hospital. Her condition was reported to be stable.\nMeanwhile, local media reports said that one of the dead could be Noordin Muhammad Top, a Malaysian suspected of planning the July 17 attacks on the Ritz-Carlton and JW Marriott hotels in the capital, Jakarta, which left nine people dead and 53 wounded.\nHowever, there was no confirmation on this from officials as a few weeks ago the police suspected that they had killed Noordin Top but it turned out to be another person. This time they are not taking any chances and a national police spokesman said that forensic tests would need to be carried out before the identities of the dead could be confirmed.\nIn recent weeks, several suspects in the July bombings were detained or killed in raids, but the authorities are still on the look-out for several suspects believed to have planned the operation and recruited the bombers.\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\nCopyright(c) 2009 RTTNews.com, Inc.
