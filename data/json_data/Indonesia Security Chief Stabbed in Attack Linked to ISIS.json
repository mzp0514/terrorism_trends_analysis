The Islamic State claimed responsibility for those attacks. The father, Dita Oepriarto, was identified afterward as the head of the Surabaya chapter of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah.\nThe assailants on Thursday approached Mr. Wiranto as he got out of his vehicle in the town of Menes in Banten Province, about 60 miles west of Jakarta. He had previously attended an event at the nearby Mathla’ul Anwar University.\nThe husband was carrying two knives, Mr. Dedi said, but police officers intervened before the wife, who was wielding scissors, could also stab Mr. Wiranto. Two police officers were injured.\nThe couple were arrested at the scene. A video taken shortly after the attack showed officers holding a man and a woman on the ground before taking them away in handcuffs.\nMr. Wiranto has played a key role in the cabinet of President Joko Widodo, most recently overseeing the government response to rioting in Papua, which has claimed dozens of lives.\nIn 2003, United Nations prosecutors charged Mr. Wiranto with crimes against humanity for his role in the violence over a 1999 referendum on independence for East Timor, which was then part of Indonesia. He has denied committing any crimes and was never prosecuted.\nMr. Wiranto, who previously served as minister of defense and commander of the armed forces, ran unsuccessfully for president in 2004 and for vice president in 2009.\nPHOTO: Indonesia’s chief security minister, Wiranto, being carried on a stretcher after an attack in western Java in Indonesia on Thursday.
