    "full text": "The Idaho Falls City Council discussed its hydroelectric property insurance and the Piranhas Swim Team debt at Monday's afternoon work session.\n      \nThe Council will vote at Thursday's meeting on whether to renew its hydroelectric insurance. The current insurance policy expires Sunday. The premium for the insurance is $335,397.\n      \nThe policy covers about $100 million loss per occurrence. This includes damage from earthquakes, flood and terrorism, according to a Moreton & Company presentation to the Council.\n      \nThe coverage includes a $250,00 deductible except for floods. The deductible for floods is 3 percent of total insured value or a minimum of $500,000.\n      \nThe Council also heard concerns from Idaho Falls Parks and Recreations Director Greg Weitzel and Municipal Services Director Pam Alexander over the Piranhas debt.\n      \nThe team disbanded last fall and owes the city $16,919.97 for use of the Wes Deist Aquatic Center. The team is requesting that the city forgive the debt because the team is unable to pay it.\n      \nThe Council agreed that the best course of action would be to write-off the debt considering the team was a nonprofit. However, moving forward the Council wants to create a policy that won't allow an organization to build up debt.\n     \n\nLoad-Date: April 26, 2018"
