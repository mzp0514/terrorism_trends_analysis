Although his work came to be sharply criticized by the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility, Yoo landed a position teaching law at the University of California, Berkeley. \nMichele Grant, co-chairwoman of the Philadelphia chapter of the National Lawyers Guild and a Drexel Law alum, said the school shouldn't give Yoo a platform. \n\"Torture is wrong, it's illegal and it's immoral,\" Grant said. \nOn Twitter: @Will_Bunch \n Blog: ph.ly/Attytood.com    \n\nGraphic\n\n \nPhotograph by: Getty Images\n\nLoad-Date: March 27, 2014"
