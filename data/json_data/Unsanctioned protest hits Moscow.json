    "full text": "Russian opposition groups gathered in Moscow today to protest the continued rule of the country by longtime figurehead President Vladimir Putin.\nDespite the relative small turnout, the demonstration continues to speak of the undercurrent of opposition to Putin's near 13 year rule.\nReporters estimate that up to 3,000 individuals gathered in Lubyanka Square without government permission to voice theirgrievances. Situated by the FSB headquarters (a state agency responsible for counter-intelligence, internal and border security, counter-terrorism, andsurveillanceoperations), protesters laid white flowers at the Solovetsky Stone, a memorial to past political prisoners sentenced to the Gulags.\nPolice and special forces arrived, calling for the crowd to voluntarily disperse; it went ignored. Law enforcement and military personnel detained scores but ultimately pushed the crowd out of the square where it eventuallydissipated.\nUnder a recent law passed in June by Putin, protesters risked fines of about $9,000 each for taking part in an unapproved protest. Organizers face an $18,000 fine.\nNotable people who took part in the demonstration were Boris Nemtsov, Alexei Navalny, Sergei Udaltsov, and Ksenia Sobchak. Nemtsov is the former deputy prime minister under Boris Yeltsin; Navalny is a famous anti-corruption blogger and lawyer; Udaltsov is the leader of the organization Left Front; and Sobchak is the dissident daughter of former St. Petersburg mayor Anatoly Sobchak.\n\nLoad-Date: January 17, 2018"
