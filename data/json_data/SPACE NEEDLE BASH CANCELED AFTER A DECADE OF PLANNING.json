    "full text": "PORTLAND -- The New Year's Eve millennial gala for 750 people at the Space Needle has been canceled.\nParty organizer Wendy Warren told The Associated Press Tuesday night that the party event almost 10 years in the planning has been called off. She would not give a reason for the decision.\n\"It has always been a joint decision,\" she said, referring to the 11 families involved. Asked if the decision was related to fears of terrorism, she declined to comment.\nThe cancellation followed Seattle Mayor Paul Schell's decision Monday to call off the after-dark New Year's Eve festivities at the Seattle Center as a precaution. City officials and others expressed worries about possible terrorist activities following the arrest of an Algerian national with a trunkful of explosives at Port Angeles.\nA source close to the families said they met Tuesday and some members said they were afraid to be in the Space Needle that night because of the possible threats of terrorism reported so heavily by the news media.\nThe families said the decision was not based on anything told to them by Seattle police, the FBI or the Seattle Center.\nAccording to KATU-TV, the Seattle Center had told the family that if the party was canceled, they would be able to work out a deal to cover the cost of the gala.\nSpace Needle spokeswoman Mary Bacarella said late Tuesday night that she knew nothing of any decision to cancel.\nThe close-knit gang of friends and family in Oregon scored a Northwest coup when they locked up the Space Needle for the New Year's Eve celebration of the century. They started working on the party nearly 10 years ago.\nThe group had spent years in happy anticipation, careful planning and installment-plan payments. But fate changed the rules in recent months.\nOne of the group William \"Tiger\" Warren died along with his three young sons in a small plane crash Thanksgiving weekend. He was the brother of party organizer Wendy Warren.\nThen, the fears of terrorism surfaced with the arrest of Ahmed Ressam on Dec. 14.\nWarren and the 10 other hosts had invited relatives and friends a total of 750 people, some traveling from Europe and Africa to wander from the Skyline level to the the flying-saucer-like Needle restaurant at the top and the observation deck above that.\n\nLoad-Date: December 29, 1999"
