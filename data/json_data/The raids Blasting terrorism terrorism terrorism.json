He publishes newspaper ads declaring that a \"fatwa\"\n(religious edict) requires all good Muslims to \"kill Americans.\"\nPresident Clinton said Washington received evidence that more attacks\nwere imminent. Cohen said the camps in Sudan were making ingredients\nfor nerve gas. He said the goal of Thursday's raids was to cripple bin\nLaden's capacity to inflict more death on Americans.\nWell, we certainly hope that was the sole motive for the U.S. strikes.\nAnd we hope they don't kindle more Islamic terrorism against America.\nSuch retaliation isn't new. President Reagan ordered an air strike on\nLibya in response to a bombing. President Bush organized the Gulf War\nagainst Iraq. Conflict with rogue Islamic factions and states is the\nchief danger of current times.  times.  times.\n\nLoad-Date: August 21, 1998"
