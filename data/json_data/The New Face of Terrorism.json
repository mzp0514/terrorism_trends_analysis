The danger posed by Mr. bin Laden and like-minded radical Islamists will not fade into memory along with fears of Y2K power failures and sewer backups. On the contrary: aggressive intelligence and law enforcement efforts by many countries may have precluded attacks over the last few weeks -- as in Jordan -- but the forces now personified in Western minds by Mr. bin Laden are here to stay.\nMost important, even if he were thrown into jail tomorrow, the threat would persist and grow. To understand why, it is important to dispel a few myths about him.\nOsama bin Laden's organization is entirely his own creation. Without him, his followers would be lost.\nMr. bin Laden's achievement has not only been to build cells in more than 50 countries, many of them self-sufficient, but to deepen bonds between extremist groups already pursuing terrorism around the globe. Indeed, the men who hijacked the India Airlines flight last month sought the release of three Kashmiri militants, at least one of whom was a leader of Harakat ul-Ansar, a group that trains in Mr. bin Laden's camps in Afghanistan.\nIn the Caucasus, the small core of Islamists who staged an insurrection in the Russian province of Dagestan earlier this year were led by a guerrilla known as Khattab, a Saudi exile associated with Mr. bin Laden.\nFinally, American officials claim that Ahmed Ressam, who was arrested in Port Angeles, Wash., allegedly with a car full of explosives, has ties to the Armed Islamic Group, a guerrilla organization fighting the military-dominated government in Algeria. This group also trains in the bin Laden camps. Mr. bin Laden's feat is to have made all these fighters -- and radicals from a score of other countries -- brothers in arms.\nOsama bin Laden sets the worldwide objectives for all Islamic terrorist groups.\nTrue, he picks targets and sets near-term strategy, but the larger agenda predates him and will survive him. Mr. bin Laden has merely tapped into a powerful and growing wave of religiously motivated hatred of the West. This hatred drove Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and Ramzi Ahmed Yousef to mastermind the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993, one of several crimes for which they are now imprisoned in the United States. Indeed, before Mr. bin Laden issued his 1998 fatwa urging Muslims to \"kill Americans and their allies,\" Sheik Rahman called for a holy struggle against American interests around the globe.\nThese terrorists are highly motivated, not by a cult of personality, but by a world view in which they are the vanguard of a divinely ordained battle to liberate Muslim lands. This outlook, and the violence at its core -- rejected by most modern Islamic authorities and anathema to most Muslims -- reflects how deeply alienated these extremists are.\nWithout Osama bin Laden's $200 million personal fortune, his followers would be nothing more than fanatical paupers.\nTerrorists can now rely on the tens of millions of dollars that flow in annually from sympathetic donors in the Arab world through a complex system of financing.\nTerrorist groups rely on contributions from wealthy religious conservatives in the Persian Gulf as well as from money diverted from the zakat -- the mosque collection plate -- on several continents. Money is often funneled through reputable charities into the hands of operatives. For instance, the World Trade Center bombing was financed through money coming from the Alkifah Refugee Center in Brooklyn. And the system of funneling money through charities has improved greatly since then.\nIn the past, terrorists have typically sought to achieve their political goals through carefully calibrated violence. They knew that excessive brutality would deny them the place they sought at the bargaining table. The Palestinian Liberation Organization under Yasir Arafat is the classic example, and the Irish Republican Army's recent course follows this model.\nThe terrorists allied with Mr. bin Laden do not want a place at the table; they want to shatter the table. They are not constrained by secular political concerns. Their objective is not to influence, but to kill, and in large numbers -- hence their declared interest in acquiring chemical and even nuclear weapons.\nIt is just this combination -- religious motivation and a desire to inflict catastrophic damage -- that is new to terrorism.\nBefore 1990, the State Department's annual terrorism survey noted few religiously motivated attacks. Since then, this number has grown, and with it the number of deaths has increased sharply. That such attacks did not increase during the first days of the new year is no reason to think this trend, or the terrorists, will go away.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: January 4, 2000"
