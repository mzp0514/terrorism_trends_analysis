He can't do it for someone as major as Osama bin Laden, and he can't do it for someone as lowly as a suspected extremist in Karachi.\nThat, he says, would be truly revolutionary.\n\"If you are able to touch that data all at one time, you can create new knowledge by pulling in things that have a relationship that you didn't know existed otherwise,\" said Brennan, a 23-year CIA veteran and Middle East expert.\nIn what's become a refrain since the Sept. 11 attacks, Brennan added, \"You really have to try to connect the dots.\"\nInquiries into the Sept. 11 attacks made clear the importance of sharing information. In one now-infamous July 2001 memo, an FBI officer in Arizona warned that bin Laden might be trying to coordinate efforts to send Islamic extremists to U.S. flight schools. Known as the \"Phoenix memo,\" it got lost inside the FBI and wasn't acted upon.\nIn his 2003 State of the Union address, President George W. Bush announced the formation of TTIC, (pronounced Tee-Tick), to bring together employees from the FBI, CIA, the Defense Department and elsewhere to \"merge and analyze all threat information in a single location.\" Today, the center has several hundred employees.\nBut some in Congress wonder why the agency hasn't yet linked all the computer systems.\n\"Can you for a moment understand my frustration?\" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., recently asked Brennan at a congressional hearing. \"It's three years after 9/11. This is not a new idea or concept -- that we would create this (computer) architecture. And here we are, three years later, almost three years later, saying, 'Boy, we're going to have to do this soon, aren't we?' What has stopped us?\"\nBrennan said the center is trying to bring disparate computer systems together.\n\"The bumper-sticker comments about we're not sharing information don't take into account the complexity of the issue,\" he said.\nBrennan and his chief information officer, William Spalding, say each government agency has developed its own networks over more than two decades. Even internally, Brennan notes, the CIA today can't do a single search against all the computer networks it has.\nTo merge or even link various networks invites problems as basic as making sure a name is a name, and a place is a place, among different databases.\nBut the problems are also as complicated as figuring out how to ensure that users can only view information within their security clearance. That alone has hampered the CIA and National Security Agency for years.\nToday, Brennan says, steps have been taken to ensure that terrorist information is disseminated. For example, Brennan's most senior deputies also have wide access to the government's many counterterrorism computer networks. Analysts at the anti-terrorism center are also allowed to access some systems, depending on their assignments and their security clearances.\n\"If the Phoenix memo took place today, we would see it as soon as FBI headquarters sees it,\" Brennan said.\nBy later this fall, Brennan and Spalding said, officials at the terrorism integration center also will have a new capability: They'll be able to conduct searches against six separate databases on two different networks belonging to the CIA and Defense Department, with more databases to come.\nThat, Brennan says, is a big deal.\nBut Spalding cautioned: \"As far as really getting to the point where (Brennan) doesn't need to toggle under the desk, that is going to be a government-wide breakthrough to make that happen.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \nphoto; THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Photo - A worker lays out some of the 80 miles of video and Internet cables for the Terrorist Threat Integration Center last month at a undisclosed location in the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington.\n\nLoad-Date: October 18, 2004"
