    "full text": "The Bush Administration must end its attempts at appeasement and compromise,and allow Israel to destroy Yasser Arafat and all other Palestinian terrorist groups.President Bush's too often repeated calls for a ceasefire in response to Palestinian terrorist attacks, such as the recent slaughter of 21 civilians at a Sabbath dinner, are useless against groups who have demonstrated time and again that their only language is empty promises and suicide bombings.American eagerness for \"negotiations\" with murderers has broadcast to the world that we are moral cowards. If the enemies of freedom attacking Israel have no reason to believe that the United States has broken with its paper-tiger past, we will be their next target.Israel is now our front line of defense against terrorism. If we want to stop the next Sept. 11 before it begins, the Bush Administration must send a new message to the Arafats, bin Ladens and Husseins of the world-by showing uncompromising moral support for Israel's right to freedom and self-defense, and by demanding justice for Arafat. We should not have a double standard-bin Laden and Arafat are the same and justice requires they be treated the same.America must make war, not peace, in its war against terrorism.\n\nLoad-Date: November 7, 2017"
