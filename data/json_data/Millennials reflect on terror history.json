Most of his classmates agreed that attacking bin Laden was the right choice, but some were skeptical bin Laden was a good target, Ross said.\nGus Bittenbender, 14, of Alstead is home-schooled, and also doesn't remember 9/11. When he heard about bin Laden's death, he thought it was a good thing for the most part, but he also believes that assassination is wrong.\nJen Fishman was in 6th grade at recess when the Twin Towers went down. Her school was located next to an Army base, and plane after plane flew overhead, and no one knew why.\nNow 20 years old and a junior at Keene State College, Fishman recalls how bin Laden was characterized to her as she grew up.\n\"He was always associated as evil or the enemy and that we had to get him,\" Fishman said.\nWhen she heard bin Laden had been killed, she was happy at first, but then feared there would be retribution.\n\"I'm honestly kind of nervous about what is going to happen next,\" Fishman said. \"Everyone had this idea that if we got Osama that all of our problems would be gone and terrorism would be gone, but it's only going to, I think, make things worse at this point.\"\nAllanna Johnson, 23, of Jaffrey agreed.\n\"People were celebrating his death, yet I feel as though the celebration was a slap in the face for others,\" Johnson said.\n\"There is some relief, but there are more terrorists out there, and this could be causing more of an uprising.\"\nJohnson was in middle school when the Twin Towers fell. In her school, many of her peers accused then-President George W. Bush of using the attack to start a war.\nSarah Harmon is 17, and grew up in Keene hearing about how bad bin Laden was, but the reaction among many Americans at the news surprised her.\n\"It's weird to celebrate someone's death,\" she said.\nDave Eisenstadter can be reached at 352-1234, extension 1432, or deisenstadter@keenesentinel.com\nTo see more of The Keene Sentinel, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.sentinelsource.com/.
