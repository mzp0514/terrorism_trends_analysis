Between 50 and 60 people heard this timely lecture.\n#LEI.BRU.OBT0#\nLt. Gen. Blanck, an Ephrata native, is an expert on bio-warfare, having been the surgeon general of the U.S. Army.\nSurprisingly, I did not see any government leaders or uniformed personnel from law enforcement or fire services from city or county government represented at the lecture.\nApproximately, six very interested medical personnel were there and aware that Lancaster County is not prepared for a bio-attack.\nI hope Lt. Gen. Blanck generated interest so the Lancaster Medical Society can produce some action in county and city government, and get a plan in effect. If city and county governments are depending on the federal government to take charge in the event of a bio-attack, that will not happen immediately.  Planning must be done at the local government levels.\nIf an attack happens, federal help won't be available for possibly one week. Lt. Gen. Blanck presented Lancaster County with a wake-up call. I would suggest county and city government leaders to start action on a bio-terrorism response plan.\nDr. Robert Gillio's Lancaster-based health education company, Innerlink, is an excellent resource for local government and emergency agencies. Now is the time to act.\nJohn H. Leibold\nLititz\n\nLoad-Date: April 9, 2002"
