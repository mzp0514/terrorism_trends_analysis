But video taken by a local TV channel showed her pacing nervously in front the Continental Airlines ticket counter and talking with an agent more than an hour before the flight left.\n\"An abuse of authority has been committed,\" Apari said. Apari, who is Salvador's father but is separated from Berenson, blamed the Interior Ministry directly and said no official explanation had been provided.\nThe Interior Ministry's communications chief, Zully Bismark, said she was not immediately able to address the issue.\nBerenson, 42, was paroled last year after serving 15 years for aiding the Tupac Amaru leftist rebel group.\nArrested in 1995, the former Massachusetts Institute of Technology student was accused of helping the rebels plan an armed takeover of Congress, an attack that never happened.\nA military court convicted her the following year and sentenced her to life in prison for sedition. After the U.S. government pressured Peruvian officials, she was retried in civil courts in 2001 and sentenced to 20 years for terrorist collaboration.\nA three-judge appeals court had given her permission to leave the country beginning Friday with the stipulation she return by Jan. 11.\nThe panel had overturned a lower-court judge's initial refusal in October.\nPeru's anti-terrorism prosecutor, Julio Galindo, told the AP he had asked the appeals court Friday to nullify the decision because it violated a law prohibiting paroled prisoners from leaving the country.\nHe said he did not know if the court had acted on his appeal and Peru's courts spokesman, Guillermo Gonzalez, said he had no information on the matter.\nBerenson's parents, often outspoken on her behalf, did not respond Saturday to phone calls seeking comment.\nSome Peruvians consider Berenson a terrorist and have publicly insulted her on the street.\nThe prosecutor, Galindo, had opposed letting Berenson out of prison before her 20-year sentence for aiding terrorism ends in 2015, saying it would set a bad precedent for the early release of others convicted of terrorism-related crimes.\nMark Berenson, who turns 70 on Dec. 29, told the AP on Friday that his daughter had every intention of returning to Peru.\n\"As Lori says, if she doesn't come home, let Interpol arrest her,\" he said.\nPeru could seek her extradition and return her to prison if she doesn't come back in the allotted time, Gonzalez said.\nOn Saturday, Berenson left her apartment around midday to take Salvador for a walk and did not comment to new crews other than to ask them to leave her in peace.\nHer journey from prison inmate to parolee has been anguished, and Peruvian news media have repeatedly hounded and mobbed her and frightened young Salvador, said Mark Berenson.\nLast month, a local TV channel obtained Berenson's new address and showed video of her home.
