Bush's adviser told the public in May 2002 that a pre-Sept. 11 terrorism intelligence briefing for the president contained only a general warning of threats and largely historical information, not specific plots.\nBut the authors of the congressional report, released last week, stated the briefing given to the president a month before the suicide hijackings included recent intelligence that al-Qaida was planning to send operatives into the United States to carry out an attack using high explosives.\nThe White House defended Rice, saying her answers were accurate given what she could state publicly at the time about still-classified information.\nOn Monday, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said Bush had full confidence in Rice. \"She is strongly committed with the president to making America safer,\" he told reporters.\nThe Sept. 11 congressional investigators underscore their point three times in their report, using nearly identical language to contrast Rice's answers with the actual information in the presidential briefing.\nThe president's daily briefing on Aug. 6, 2001, contained \"information acquired in May 2001 that indicated a group of (Osama) bin Laden supporters was planning attacks in the United States with explosives,\" the report stated.\nA footnote to that passage compares the information with what Rice told the public at a May 16, 2002, news conference.\nRice \"stated, however, that the report did not contain specific warning information, but only a generalized warning, and did not contain information that al-Qaida was discussing a particular planned attack against a specific target at any specific time, place, or by any specific method,\" the footnote said.\nAt the same May 2002 news media briefing, Rice also said that \"I don't think anybody could have predicted that these people would take an airplane and slam it into the World Trade Center, take another one and slam it into the Pentagon; that they would try to use an airplane as a missile, a hijacked airplane as a missile.\"\nBut the congressional report states that \"from at least 1994, and continuing into the summer of 2001, the Intelligence Community received information indicating that terrorists were contemplating, among other means of attack, the use of aircraft as weapons.\"\nThe report says that Rice and other top officials, including President Bill Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, and Defense Undersecretary Paul Wolfowitz, seemed unaware of the intelligence and concludes the information must not have been widely circulated.\nMore recently, Rice's explanations about what the White House knew about Iraq also have been questioned by members of Congress and by Democrats seeking the presidential nomination. She told reporters several weeks ago that Bush's State of the Union message never would have included any mention of Iraq shopping for uranium in Africa \"if we had known what we know now.\" But Stephen Hadley, Rice's deputy, disclosed last Tuesday that two CIA memos and a telephone call from CIA Director George Tenet had persuaded him to take a similar passage about Iraq and uranium out of a presidential speech three months before the State of the Union address.\n\nNotes\n\nPAGE 2; Note: a shorter version of this article ran in the FIVE STAR LATE LIFT Edition, page A4.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO; Photo headshot - (Condoleeza) Rice; National security adviser; Note: a color photo ran in the FIVE STAR LATE LIFT Edition, page A4.\n\nLoad-Date: July 29, 2003"
