The airport handled about 95 flights per hour during last summer's peak.\nThe 83-flight cap is the same one that starts Saturday at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, where about 100 flights per hour were scheduled last summer. Similar flight caps, which are intended to alleviate record-high delays, already exist at New York's LaGuardia Airport.\nJFK, LaGuardia and Newark last year had the nation's lowest on-time arrival rates.\nMELVILLE, N.Y.\nSchool district blocks student's service dog\nA Long Island school official said a hearing-impaired teenager will not be allowed to bring his service dog to school, despite a ruling Monday that the district's policy violates state law.\nEast Meadow school district Superintendent Leon Campo said Monday that the district, which intends to appeal, disagreed with the order's contention that disabled students have an \"absolute right\" to bring service animals to school. The district has argued that animals pose a safety threat to other students.\nThe state Division of Human Rights ruled that John Cave, 15, must be allowed to bring his dog, Simba, to his high school. Cave tried several times last year to bring Simba to school, but was blocked by school officials.\nWASHINGTON\nVenezuela could be listed as supporting terrorism\nFollowing up on allegations that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's links to Colombian guerrillas have been much deeper than previously thought, a senior U.S. government official has confirmed that President George W. Bush's administration has asked its lawyers to look into what gets a country on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism.\nThe investigation is the first step in a process that could see Venezuela join North Korea, Cuba, Sudan, Syria and Iran as countries that the State Department has designated as supporters of terrorism.\nWASHINGTON\nSaddam had no link to al-Qaida, study says\nAn exhaustive review of more than 600,000 Iraqi documents that were captured after the 2003 U.S. invasion has found no evidence that Saddam Hussein's regime had any operational links with Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida terrorist network.\nThe Pentagon-sponsored study, scheduled for release later this week, did confirm that Saddam's regime provided some support to other terrorist groups, particularly in the Middle East, U.S. officials told McClatchy Newspapers.\nPresident George W. Bush and his aides used Saddam's alleged relationship with al-Qaida, along with Iraq's supposed weapons of mass destruction, as arguments for invading Iraq after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\nWASHINGTON\nReporter seeks to block fines dictated by judge\nA former USA Today reporter sought Monday to block fines of up to $5,000 per day imposed by a judge who wants her to disclose confidential sources for stories on a scientist under scrutiny in the 2001 anthrax attacks.\nToni Locy must pay fines out of her own pocket as long as she refuses to identify her sources. In addition, she could be ordered to prison after a hearing April 3 if she continues to defy the judge in a lawsuit against the government filed by Steven J. Hatfill.\nThe judge wants Locy to reveal her sources so Hatfill's lawyers can question them.\n\nNotes\n\n Nation \n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO\n PHOTO - TAKING FLIGHT  With the space shuttle Endeavor behind them on the launchpad, white ibis work on their own takeoffs and landings Monday at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla.
