Good Morning America bought two for Diane Sawyer, one for her office and one for her home, said David Swift of Largo, who designed the map after watching the store of which he is part-owner sell every map it had of Afghanistan in the days after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\nMAP05\nUnlike most, Swift's map shows both Southwest Asia and the Middle East, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Arabian Peninsula and parts of Iran, China and India. It's topographical, showing how mountainous Afghanistan is as well as each country's capital, major cities, railroads, airports and highways.\nA small American flag takes up the bottom two corners of the map, which measures 2 feet by 3 feet and costs $ 34.95 with lamination and $ 19.95 without.\nWithin a week of putting the map on sale, the store sold 375 and expects the other 600 already printed to sell quickly.\n\"At the first sign of military action, we won't be able to keep up with demand,\" Swift said.\nMaps of Afghanistan in New York City were snapped up within 24 hours of the attacks. The U.S. State Department bought the entire stock kept by Map Link of Santa Barbara, Calif., the country's biggest wholesale map distributor.\nThe sole manufacturer of maps of Afghanistan is a small company in Germany, which became swamped with back orders, Swift said.\nThat left smaller outlets such as A World of Maps in Tampa, which advertises in the Yellow Pages of Manhattan.\nThe business, which opened in 1991, sells custom maps to businesses, law enforcement, the military, news organizations and government agencies. It also sells compasses, globes, atlases and satellite images.\nSwift's \"World of Terrorism\" map shows where Islamic extremists are thought to be hiding, and includes the Middle East, where conflict between Islamic nations and the West has been most intense.\nNational Geographic is offering a similar map, printing 10,000 that show Afghanistan, Pakistan and the Middle East.\nThe goal is to give \"a better view of the entire theater of concern,\" said Gavin Maurer, a vice president for marketing for National Geographic.\nAt Map Link since the attack, customers have bought 6,000 copies of a map of the Middle East originally published during Desert Storm, said sales manager Martana Rybnicek. Like those being produced by National Geographic and A World of Maps, it shows both the Middle East and Southwest Asia, from Turkey in the west to Pakistan in the east.\nSwift also produced a large map of Southwest Asia for an ABC affiliate in New Haven, Conn., which will use it as a backdrop for reports from a military expert on terrorism. He also did one of the Middle East for the U.S. Navy to use for \"tactical planning.\"\nOrders from the Middle East aren't unusual for the store, which has customers worldwide. But since the attacks, store employees have been scrutinizing orders.\nThey turned one down recently, a request from a businessman in the United Arab Emirates for a map of the Arabian Peninsula. It struck them as strange, since such maps are likely to be available there.\n\"Now we're actually thinking, who are we making this for?\" said Gilbert D'Amore, general manager of the store. \"Who's using it and what for?\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO, THOMAS M. GOETHE; David A. Swift, a cartographer and vice president of sales at A World of Maps in Tampa, has produced a \"War on Terrorism\" map showing Southwest Asia and the Middle East. \"At the first sign of military action, we won't be able to keep up with demand,\" he said.\n\nLoad-Date: October 5, 2001"
