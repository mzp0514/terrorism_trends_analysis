Indeed, don't tell the families of the five Afghan police officers killed Monday in a raid in Kandahar.\nThe world has turned its attention to the struggles of the Bush administration to build on its military victory in Iraq. There, fighters loyal to fallen Iraqi President Saddam Hussein continue to harass and kill American troops.\nWith such controversy and danger in Iraq, it's easy to forget the other major front in the war on terrorism. Forgetting, however, would be a mistake.\nBush acted with just the right measure of patience and resolve following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York. The American campaign to oust the Taliban from power in Afghanistan was decisive and successful. That government had harbored the al-Qaida terrorists who plotted the American attacks, and it was justifiably removed.\nLeft behind is an interim authority run by President Hamid Karzai. The goals now in Afghanistan are to eliminate the remaining Taliban and al-Qaida fighters, help the nation rebuild after decades of war and establish a working democracy there.\nThere are troubling signs that the United States is falling behind in all three areas.\nThe Taliban continue to be active, attacking elements of Karzai's government. The attack on the police station in Kandahar is just a recent example. The Taliban are said to be working with other Afghan militants in an attempt to reassert themselves and disrupt recovery efforts.\nThose efforts, by the way, are coming along poorly. The Wall Street Journal reports that the interim government's foreign minister has said publicly the United States is not doing enough to help the nation recover economically.\nMeanwhile, efforts to conduct Afghanistan's first democratic elections in more than 30 years are behind schedule. A planned census of the population - a necessary step in forming an appropriately representative government - is coming along slowly. The Christian Science Monitor says the government is short on the funds needed to conduct elections.\nAll of this is bad news for the war on terrorism, which cannot be won without a stable and democratic Afghanistan.\n\nLoad-Date: July 16, 2003"
