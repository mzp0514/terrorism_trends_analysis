And it seems that he trained the young men he lured into his terrorist cell to behave in much the same way, carrying on double lives that betrayed little of their real intentions.\nAbdelbaki Es Satty, the shadowy imam who the authorities believe was at the center of last week's terrorist attacks in and near Barcelona, Spain, appears to have been a master of deception. His associations with jihadis reached back more than a decade, but he managed to evade the scrutiny of authorities and the suspicion of many in Ripoll, the small town in northern Catalonia where he showed up last year to offer his services.\nEs Satty's technique, according to terrorism experts, was taken right from the playbook of al-Qaida jihadi recruiters with whom he had first come into contact at least 11 years ago. It now appears that he used those methods to carefully select and groom young recruits, but for the Islamic State.\n\"He was really nice, charming, really polite, but he was too polite, too correct,\" said Wafa Marsi, 30, who grew up with the older members of the cell the imam forged in the town.\n\"Usually you can get a sense of a person by their look, their smile, but you couldn't with him,\" said Marsi, who also described his appearance. \"And that is why I did not trust him.\"\nEs Satty died on Aug. 16, when the explosives he was manufacturing with the help of some of his young recruits blew up in their safe house in Alcanar, south of Barcelona. But his spell over the young men remained so powerful that the plot he put in motion went forward the next day without a bomb, ultimately killing 15 people.\nHow Es Satty slipped through the checks meant to protect the public from would-be terrorists speaks to the lack of communication between Spanish national and Catalan regional law enforcement and the judiciary.\nBut it also shows the skill of an experienced terrorist recruiter, one who appears to have been trained in keeping a low profile so that no one would think to look into his background.\nIf they had, they would have found only that he had been convicted once of drug trafficking. That is an important reason Es Satty was able to fly under the radar of Spain's counter-terrorism authorities; he had no charges or convictions for terrorism-related offenses.\nYet Es Satty had been known to the Spanish judicial and counterterrorism authorities for at least 10 years, according to Fernando Reinares, the director of the Program on Global Terrorism at the Elcano Royal Institute in Madrid, which keeps an extensive database of Spanish jihadis based on court records and other official sources.\n\"Abdelbaki Es Satty had some kind of contacts, dating back a decade ago, with facilitators of the Madrid train bombing network based in Catalonia and, subsequently, while in prison, with a member of that same terrorist network,\" Reinares said.\nThe Madrid train bombings killed more than 190 people and wounded hundreds more.\nIn the aftermath of last week's attacks, regional and national law enforcement authorities and politicians are sniping at one another for failing to cooperate more closely. Their relationship was already strained because of Catalonia's effort to win independence from Spain.\nCatalan law enforcement authorities have long complained that they are not allowed to work on their own with foreign intelligence organizations such as the CIA.\nAnother problem appears to be that information gleaned by counterterrorism intelligence operatives that does not result in charges or convictions is not systematically made available to local law enforcement.\nRecords of behavior in prison - increasingly understood as an important factor in radicalization - also appear not to be widely shared.\nWhile there is an Islamic Council of Catalonia that vets imams, it was not asked about this imam, its coordinator, Jamal Elattouaki, said.\nThe mayor of Ripoll, Jordi Munell, said that the local police should have gotten more warning about the dangers presented by Es Satty.\n\"The information that someone had did not arrive where it should have,\" he said, adding that suggested that the Spanish government had not passed it on to the Catalan authorities.\nMeanwhile, Spanish police officers denounced Catalan officials for \"marginalizing in a painful way\" the contribution of Spain's national and military authorities during the investigation and manhunt.\n\nLoad-Date: August 24, 2017"
