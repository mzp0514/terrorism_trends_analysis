The Obama Administration had quite a bit of interaction with the government of Pakistan over the LeT&apos;s activities after the Mumbai attacks--blamed on the LeT--that killed 166 people, including many Americans, he added.\n\"Obviously, India has expressed its concerns as well (on LeT),\" he said replying to a question.\nHis observations came close on the heels of the suggestion of U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia Robert Blake that Pakistan rein in the LeT, given its increasing capacity to target other countries, including the U.S.\nHe said Saturday in an interview: \"Lashkar-e-Taiba is a terrorist group based in Pakistan that has increasingly global ambitions and global scope--and so it&apos;s in the interests of Pakistan to rein in its activities.\"\nIn a sign of growing concern in the U.S. over the rise of the LeT, his comments came a day after a hearing on the Capitol Hill where Congressmen noted, \"The LeT has put the world on notice that they intend to escalate the carnage and spread it worldwide.\"\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\nCopyright(c) 2010 RTTNews.com, Inc.
