With the exception of Israel's leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, not one single leader of a non-Muslim country has a clue how to end Islamic terrorism.\n      \nOn New Year's Day, the Muslim leader of Egypt, el-Sisi, finally broke the ice. He made it clear that the end of terrorism must come from within Islam itself. He said it is ridiculous for 1.6 billion Muslims to think they can kill off the other 7 billion people on this earth. He called for a major reformation of Islamic theology.\n      \nIslam is the only religion that resorts to stoning, flogging, beheading, limb amputation, \"honor\" killing, genitalia mutilation and other acts of barbarism. Terrorists claim they are duty bound to their god, Allah, to kill all non-believers (infidels) and impose Sharia Law on all survivors on the earth. They quote the Koran to justify their mission. Do all Muslims believe that? If not, where is the outrage from moderate Muslims repudiating such theology?\n      \nThe defeat of Islamic terrorism must start with our president convincing all non-Muslim nations, including Russia and China, to join us in outlawing Sharia Law and begin a massive deportation of all Sharia supporters from our lands.\n      \nOnly when moderate Muslims by the millions start losing their happy homes will they finally decide to crush their barbaric brethren and modernize their theology.\n      \n(Word count: 229)\n      \nSTANLEY P. BICKEL\n      \nAmmon\n     \n\nLoad-Date: February 25, 2015"
