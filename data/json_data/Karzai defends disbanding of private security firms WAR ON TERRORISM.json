    "full text": "KABUL, AFGHANISTAN - President Hamid Karzai defended on Sunday his decision to disband private security firms, saying they were undermining Afghanistan's police and army and contributing to corruption.\nLast Monday, Karzai ordered Afghan and international security companies to disband by the end of the year, despite U.S. concerns the short deadline may endanger American development projects that private guards protect. NATO uses private security to guard supply convoys bringing food, water and other supplies to military bases throughout the country. Critics have said Afghanistan's own security forces are not ready to assume the burden.\nAbout 37 companies are working with the U.S. government, totaling about 26,000 armed security contractors.\nKarzai told ABC's \"This Week with Christiane Amanpour\" that the companies undermine the government's effort to recruit more police and soldiers because it can't compete with the private firms in salaries. He also repeated allegations that many companies are contributing to corruption by shaking down transport firms for money, some of which goes to warlords and the Taliban.\nU.S. congressional investigators have been looking into allegations that Afghan security firms were extorting as much as $4 million a week from contractors paid by the U.S. and then funneling the money to warlords and the Taliban to avoid attacks against convoys. Allegations of widespread corruption have also been levied at the Afghan police.\n\nLoad-Date: August 24, 2010"
