    "full text": "The Israeli Parliament, by a vote of 55 to 10, gave preliminary approval yesterday to an amendment to the so-called ''prevention of terrorism'' law that would make it a crime to carry Palestinian flags or sing Palestinian songs.\nThe legislation, which must still pass a second and third reading in the Parliament before becoming law, is meant to replace the British Mandate laws, but it would not cover the Palestinian Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, who remain under Israeli military rule.\nAN-A\nUnder the proposal, public expression of sympathy or identification with a terrorist organization, the carrying of Palestinian flags and the singing of Palestinian anthems would be punishable by a jail term of up to three years or a fine of up to $5,000, or both.\nAt the same time, a parliamentary commiteee approved a modified version of the bill establishing Jerusalem as the ''united and indivisible'' capital of Israel.\nTo obtain the support of the Labor Party opposition for the bill, its supporters agreed to delete from the original draft a phrase specifying that ''the post six-day war borders shall not be violated,'' a reference to the 1967 Middle East war in which Israel conquered the Jordanian half of the city.\nThe committee added clauses today providing for the protection of holy places in Jerusalem and free access to them."
