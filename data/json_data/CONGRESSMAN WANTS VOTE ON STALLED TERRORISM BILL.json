Charles Schumer of New York,\nsenior Democrat of the House Judiciary subcommittee on crime, said at\nthe panel's hearing on armed, private militias.\n\"It is time to stop the secret, backroom negotiations that are going on\nregarding this bill,\" said Schumer. He filed a petition Thursday to\nbring the bill to the floor within a week or so. The petition requires\n218 signatures to take effect.\nFellow panel member Bob Barr, R-Ga., a leading opponent of the measure,\nrejected Schumer's assertions.\n\"There's no backroom dealing,\" Barr said.
