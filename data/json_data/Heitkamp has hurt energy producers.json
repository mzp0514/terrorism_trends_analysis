    "full text": "Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., recently touted her support for North Dakota's energy industry, boldly declaring she led the fight to repeal the oil export ban in 2015.\nLed the fight? First, understand that Heitkamp ultimately was a cosponsor of legislation written by Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a bill that reached the president's desk only after it was added to the must-pass House omnibus spending bill. Others did the heavy lifting.\nViewing this from the perspective of an energy industry CEO, voters should know Heitkamp's true record is one that places her squarely on the side of North Dakota's competitors, primary among them, the Islamic Republic of Iran.\nThe Iran Deal was deeply flawed. It included an expiration date that would have allowed Iran to produce nuclear weapons within a year of the deal's end, while allowing Tehran to grow fat on millions in oil profits that were funneled into the hands of Hezbollah and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard. These are organizations that support the genocidal Assad regime in Syria and have engaged in atrocious acts of terrorism across the Middle East.\nThe Iran deal wasn't the first time Heitkamp voted against North Dakota. She has repeatedly forsaken our values to curry favor with her Democratic colleagues in Washington. Heitkamp voted against repeal of the Obama administration's duplicative and unworkable BLM flaring rule, even though she knew, as a former EPA attorney, that North Dakota already had a similar rule in place.\nDan Eberhart, Watford City\n\nLoad-Date: July 15, 2018"
