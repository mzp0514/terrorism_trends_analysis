    "full text": "Four serving members of the British Army suspected of membership in a neo-Nazi group were arrested Tuesday on suspicion of being involved “in the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism,” law enforcement officials said.\nThe police in West Midlands said the four men — a 22-year-old from Birmingham, in the West Midlands; a 32-year-old man from Powys, in Wales; a 24-year-old from Ipswich, in Suffolk; and a 24-year-old from Northampton, in the East Midlands were being held at a police station in the West Midlands and that police had searched several properties in connection with the arrests.\n“The arrests were preplanned and intelligence-led,” the West Midlands police said in a statement, adding that there had been no threat to the public’s safety.\nThe police did not immediately provide details of any plot in the works, how the men had been arrested or what their roles were in the army.\nThe Ministry of Defense confirmed in a statement that “a number of serving members of the Army have been arrested under the Terrorism Act for being associated with a proscribed far-right group.” It said that the army had supported the police-led operation.\nThe police said the men were suspected of being members of National Action, a far-right group banned last year that is known for racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic views. The group, which was created in 2013, has described itself as a “National Socialist” organization and has made a particular effort to attract young people.\nIn banning the group, the government made membership a criminal offense punishable by up to 10 years in jail. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, said at the time that the group “stirs up hatred, glorifies violence and promotes a vile ideologue.” She added: “I will not stand for it. It has absolutely no place in a Britain that works for everyone.”\nFar-right groups have come under closer scrutiny in recent months amid growing fears that their views are attracting a wider audience, spurred by anti-immigrant sentiment and xenophobia that some analysts say has been driven by Britain’s decision to leave the European Union.\nMembers of National Action have previously praised Thomas Mair, an unemployed gardener obsessed with Nazi propaganda and white supremacist ideology, who in June 2016 was convicted of killing Jo Cox, a Labour member of Parliament. Ms. Cox had supported immigrant causes and Britain remaining in the European Union.\nWhen he appeared in court and was asked his name, Mr. Mair replied, “My name is death to traitors, freedom for Britain.” The group co-opted the phrase as a slogan on its former website.\nFollow Dan Bilefsky on Twitter @DanBilefsky.\nRelated Articles\nWhat About the Terrorism of the Far Right?\nRight-Wing Extremist Convicted of Murdering Jo Cox, a U.K. Lawmaker\n\nLoad-Date: September 7, 2017"
