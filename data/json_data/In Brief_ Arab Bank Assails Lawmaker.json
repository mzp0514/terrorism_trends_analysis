    "full text": "Arab Bank PLC said \"gutter politics\" motivated a New York congressman to\nintroduce legislation that would close its Manhattan branch.\nRep. Anthony Weiner, a Democrat representing Brooklyn and Queens, and\nthree other Democrats announced a bill Wednesday that would also seize the\nbranch's assets on behalf of terrorism victims who have sued the bank. The\nbill would also require the Treasury Department to issue a public report on\nits investigation of Arab Bank.\nRep. Weiner said the bank has ties to terrorists and has \"no business\nbeing in business in the United States, and certainly not in New York City.\"\nThe bank said in a statement issued through a spokesman that Rep.\nWeiner's actions were \"deplorable\" and \"designed to promote his last-place\nmayoral campaign by attacking a respectable Arab institution.\" The bank said\nthat it is \"strongly committed to preventing the financing of terrorism,\" and\nthat the bill uses \"terrorism to mask blatant discriminatory action against a \nbank and a people based on race.\"\nIn February, Arab Bank consented to an order by the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency that required it to cease all wire transfers and\nwind up banking operations other than trade financing. The OCC said at the \ntime that the bank had failed to monitor suspicious transactions.\nhttp://www.americanbanker.com            http://www.sourcemedia.com\n\nLoad-Date: October 31, 2006"
