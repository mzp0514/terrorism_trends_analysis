    "full text": "While international terrorist incidents dropped to a 25-year low last year, the number of casualties reached a near-record 311 dead and 2,652 wounded, the State Department reported yesterday.\nThe higher casualty toll reflected a continuing trend toward more-ruthless attacks on noncombatant targets and the use of more-powerful bombs, said the report, which is released annually.\nIt said Iran ''remained the premier state sponsor of terrorism,'' conducting at least eight dissident assassinations outside Iran in 1996.\nAccording to the report, there were 296 acts of international terrorism last year, 144 fewer than in 1995.\nThe worst incident was a bombing carried out by a Sri Lankan separatist group that killed 90 and wounded more than 1,400.\nAmong the year's other significant attacks was the truck bombing at a U.S. military housing facility near Dharan, Saudi Arabia, that killed 19 U.S. citizens and wounded some 500 people.\nThis was the highest number of U.S. citizens killed in a single act of international terrorism since the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland, in which 189 U.S. citizens were among the 270 dead.\nAll told, 24 Americans died in terrorist incidents last year - the 19 in Saudi Arabia and five in bus bombings and drive-by shootings in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.\nThe number of Americans wounded in terrorist incidents rose to 250, five times the figure for 1995.\nOf the 296 attacks last year, two-thirds were minor acts of politically motivated violence against commercial targets, which caused no deaths and few casualties, the report said.\nSeventy-six of the attacks were attributed to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in Germany but most were inconsequential. The PKK is a Turkish-based rebel group.\n \nThe list of countries designated by the United States as sponsors of terrorism remained unchanged from 1995: Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria.\n\nLoad-Date: May 2, 1997"
