Arafat said \"there are enemies of peace on both sides\" who are trying to jeopardize the security in the region.\nGore announced a $ 73 million U.S. aid package for development and public works in the Gaza Strip. He also said President Clinton had authorized Palestinians to export a range of goods to the United States, duty-free, from the West Bank on Gaza. The move will allow more than 4,600 agricultural and industrial products to be shipped into the United States without tariffs.\n\nLoad-Date: March 24, 1995"
