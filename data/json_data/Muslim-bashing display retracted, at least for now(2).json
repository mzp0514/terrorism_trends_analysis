Then he showed Allen the press releases and articles that CAIR had issued to condemn terrorism and explain Islam to U.S. citizens. He also showed Allen a video of a public service announcement that CAIR recently released. The video, like the press releases, condemns terrorism.\n\"He was surprised to see those different things and that we're actually taking action,\" Bedier said.\nBedier also showed Allen pictures of his wife and child.\nThen Bedier asked Allen to remove the display.\nAllen said he agreed because Bedier had been \"so nice.\"\n\"We took pictures of me removing the sign,\" Allen said. \"I took it back over to the trash cans . . . and I put that sign in the trash can.\"\nHe also got rid of the toilet.\nAllen said, \"I told him I wished I had some bread in the house. We'd break bread.\"\nInstead, the two ate grapes and cantaloupe.\nThen Allen agreed to visit Bedier's mosque to break the fast of Ramadan in October.\nFor Bedier, the experience was hopeful and supported his belief that people are less likely to have anti-Muslim beliefs once they get to know members of the faith.\n\"I think more of us need to reach out and communicate with each other,\" Bedier said. \"It was a good experience for me to see how different approaches could work.\"\nBedier said Allen seemed like a nice person who just might have had a \"change of heart.\"\nMaybe. Maybe not.\nAllen explained to Neighborhood Times that he has a wait-and-see attitude. If he does not see CAIR's public service announcement or Muslim clerics speaking out, he will re-create the display.\nAs for Bedier, Allen said, \"He was really the most charming person. But I realize that we've all been charmed before.\"\nWhile Allen is monitoring Muslim reaction to terrorism, he has plans for a smaller toilet that he has. First, he'll flush pictures of people with whom he politically disagrees, such as U.S. Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., U.S. Rep. Barbara Pelosi, D-Calif., and U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill.\nThen he may turn to Pinellas Park's code enforcement department. Allen has a continuing war with two of the code officers, Vinny Cassara and Vicky Watson, and their boss, Sgt. Tracey Schofield.\n\"I think I'm going to have a Schofield, Vinny and Vicky flush,\" Allen said.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO; Ahmed Bedier (ran East, South, Beach, Seminole)\n\nLoad-Date: July 31, 2005"
