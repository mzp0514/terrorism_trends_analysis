    "full text": "A State Department official said today that about 70 acts of terrorism had been committed against American and allied interests outside the United States since the Persian Gulf war began, including 11 in the last day.\n\"These incidents have resulted in property damage,\" said Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman. \"So far the injuries have been relatively few.\"\nIraqis have been directly involved in only one of the incidents, a failed attempt to bomb a United States library in Manila on Jan. 19, she said.\nThe attacks have ranged from the firing of an automatic weapon into gates of the American Embassy in Yemen to an incident in which a hand grenade was lobbed over the wall of Turkish Ambassador's residence in Yemen. No one was hurt.\nSo far, the attacks have not been definitively linked to well-known Middle East terror groups, but appear to be largely random acts by \"kindred spirits\" of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, said Vincent Cannistraro, a former terrorism official at the Central Intelligence Agency.\n \nLong-Term Vigilance Urged\n In a separate meeting with reporters, the Federal Bureau of Investigation official in charge of domestic counter-terrorism said increased vigilance would be necessary long after the war ends in the gulf despite the lack of clear evidence of planned terrorist acts in the United States.\n\"I tell our agents it's a mile or two-mile race, and we are only in the first lap, so you don't want to have any burnout,\" said William M. Baker, an assistant director at the F.B.I.\nThe long-term concern is based on the expectation that terrorist groups may decide that the tight security at airports and government buildings will be lowered in the future, allowing terrorists greater freedom of action to attack targets like civilian aircraft.\nThe gulf crisis has spawned hate crimes against Arab-Americans in the United States, Mr. Baker said. He said the bureau was investigating 26 charges of crimes against Arab-Americans, ranging from threatening phone calls to fire-bombings.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPhoto: About 70 acts of terrorism have been committed against American and allied interests outside the United States, according to the State Department.
