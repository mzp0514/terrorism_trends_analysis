    "full text": "When you go to see this movie, and I promise you want to, keep in mind that Navy SEALs are not actors. What starts out as a routine rescue mission ends up uncovering a terrorist plot of astronomical size. That's about it for the plot. It's nothing extravagant, but it doesn't matter. All it does is symbolize how real of a threat terrorism is, and, of course, lead the viewer to the next firefight.\nSeeing real Navy SEALs working and performing in their element is just phenomenal. These men, and others like them, are the highest trained military personnel on the planet. Watching them operate the way they would on a real battle field is something every American should see. Knowing that the tactics and procedures you are seeing are very real is an eerie and unusual feeling. The SEALs even used live rounds while filming.\nIt's obvious that they aren't actors, but they play a real role in protecting our freedom that's more significant than some movie.\nThe camera angles in the movie are very unique. Occasionally they even switch to third person, which is a nice change up from the normal angles.\nFor most of the movie, you focus on only two SEALs. You really only get attached to two characters because the movie mainly focuses on those two. I feel like the movie as a whole would have made an even greater impact had there been more character development. Overall, I left the theater 100 percent satisfied and in slight disbelief. The experience was like no other war movie, if you could even call it that, and it is quite moving.\n4.5 out of 5 stars\n\nLoad-Date: September 20, 2013"
