Business Insurance invites readers to take part in an interactive Webcast on Aug. 29, 2006, exploring ``A Permanent Solution to TRIA.''\nAn expert panel representing leading insurers, brokers and risk managers will discuss proposals for handling terrorism risk in the United States. Business Insurance Editor Regis Coccia will moderate the webinar.\nSeveral proposals have been floated to create a more permanent solution to financing U.S. terrorism risk and providing security to insurers that write the coverage, particularly workers compensation. Before the TRIA extension expires at the end of 2007, industry leaders are pushing for new and more lasting solutions. Attend this online panel discussion to learn about some of these new concepts, hear the viewpoints of our expert panelists and ask questions during the live event.\nBI's Online Executive ForumTM webinars, developed by our editorial staff, are highly informative online events where noted speakers and respected business leaders come together with BI editors to discuss the most pressing issues in this live interactive format.\nTo register for the Aug. 29 Online Executive Forum on TRIA, please visit www.BusinessInsurance.com/webinars.\n\nLoad-Date: July 21, 2006"
