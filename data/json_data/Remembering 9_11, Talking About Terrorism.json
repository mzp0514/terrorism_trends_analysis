This hindered the organization`s capabilities to plot and carry out deadly attacks.\nGiven this, should Americans be worried about terrorism twelve years later? Many CCNY students weighed in on the issue.\nCCNY Student Depak Bohara says, \"I believe terrorism will always be a significant threat. However, it has become less of an issue due to the more stringent practices our government has placed to prevent foreign terrorist attacks.\"\nAnother student, Cem Uyar, says, \"Although domestic security measures have significantly improved since 9/11, the threat of terrorism is still present. However, it is certainly not as significant a threat today as it was 12 years ago, especially since the death of Osama Bin Laden.\"\nSenior Christina Holder tells The Campus, \"I think the threat is still there and we shouldn't slack off. However, we shouldn't profile people because history has shown that terrorism isn't defined by race.\"\n\nLoad-Date: September 18, 2013"
