Lauderdale, Fla.; Jared Chase, 24, of Keene, N.H.; and, Brent Vincent Betterly, 24, of Oakland Park, Fla.\nIf convicted on all counts - conspiracy to commit terrorism, material support for terrorism and possession of explosives - the men could get up to 85 years in prison.\nOutside the courtroom, Deutsch said the two undercover police officers or informants also were arrested during the Wednesday raid, and defense attorneys later lost track of the two.\n\"We believe this is all a setup and entrapment to the highest degree,\" Deutsch said.\nThe suspects were each being held on $1.5 million bond. Six others arrested Wednesday in the raid were released Friday without being charged.\nThe three who remained in custody apparently came to Chicago late last month to take part in May Day protests. Relatives and acquaintances said the men were wanderers who bounced around as part of the Occupy movement and had driven together from Florida to Chicago, staying with other activists.\nCourt records indicated no prior violent behavior.\nLongtime observers of police tactics said the operation seemed similar to those conducted by authorities in other cities before similarly high-profile events. For instance, prior to the Republican National Convention in 2008 in St. Paul, Minn., prosecutors charged eight activists who were organizing mass protests with terrorism-related crimes after investigators said they recovered equipment for Molotov cocktails, slingshots with marbles and other items.\nThe protesters, who became known as the RNC Eight, denied the allegations and accused authorities of stifling dissent. The terrorism charges were later dismissed.\nCourt records indicated no prior violent behavior.\nLongtime observers of police tactics said the operation seemed similar to those conducted by authorities in other cities before similarly high-profile events.\nFor instance, prior to the Republican National Convention in 2008 in St. Paul, Minn., prosecutors charged eight activists who were organizing mass protests with terrorism-related crimes after investigators said they recovered equipment for Molotov cocktails, slingshots with marbles and other items.\nThe protesters, who became known as the RNC Eight, denied the allegations and accused authorities of stifling dissent. The terrorism charges were later dismissed. Five of the suspects eventually pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges, and three had their cases dismissed altogether.\nMolotov cocktails are dangerous weapons, but it \"kind of stretches the bounds to define that as terrorism,\" said Michael Scott, director of the Center for Problem-Oriented Policing at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\nHe said police have a history of abusing such tactics, sometimes infiltrating purely peaceful protest groups to search for troublemakers.\nBut if the allegations are true, police were justified in moving quickly to take the men off the streets, even if the terrorism charges don't stick.\nJust one week before their arrest, at least two of the suspects were involved in a minor confrontation with police captured on a video that was then posted on YouTube and aired widely by Chicago media, said another defense attorney, Sarah Gelsomino.\nThe men had been stopped by police after turning their car into a private driveway.\nIn the video, one officer asks another what Chicago police would have said in 1968 when they clashed with demonstrators at the Democratic National convention.\n\"Billy club to the ... skull,\" the officer responds. Another officer says to the men in the car, who the police take as protesters, \"We'll come look for you.\"\nDocuments filed by prosecutors in support of the charges in Chicago painted an ominous portrait of the men, saying the trio also discussed using swords, hunting bows and knives with brass-knuckle handles in their attacks.\nRelatives and acquaintances painted a starkly different picture.\nActivist Bill Vassilakis, who said he let the men stay in his apartment, described Betterly as an industrial electrician who had volunteered to help with wiring at The Plant, a former meatpacking facility that has been turned into a food incubator with the city's backing.\n\"All I can say about that is, if you knew Brent, you would find that to be the most ridiculous thing you've ever heard. He was the most stand-up guy that was staying with me. He and the other guys had done nothing but volunteer their time and energy,\" he said.\nBetterly appears to have a history of minor run-ins with law enforcement.\nEarlier this year, he was cited for disorderly intoxication in February in Miami-Dade County, Fla., but the case has been dismissed, according to online court records.\nAuthorities in Oakland Park, Fla., said Betterly and two other young men walked into a public high school last fall after a night of tequila drinking and took a swim in the pool, according to a report in the South Florida Sun-Sentinel.\nThey stole fire extinguishers from three school buses, discharged one and smashed a cafeteria window with another. The vandalism caused about $2,000 in damage. Betterly was charged with burglary, theft and criminal mischief, the newspaper said.\nChase grew up in Keene, N.H., and moved to Boston a few years ago before becoming active in the Occupy movement, said his aunt, Barbara Chase of Westmoreland, N.H.\nJared Chase's father, Steve Chase, died about five weeks ago after a long struggle with a disease that left him disabled, Barbara Chase said. The family had been waiting for him to come home before having a funeral.\nShe said she was stunned to learn of the charges against her nephew.\n\"That surprised me because he's not that dumb,\" said Barbara Chase. \"He always seemed harmless, but who knows? Outside influences sometimes can sway people to do things that they normally wouldn't do.\"\nElsewhere around Chicago, demonstrations remained relatively small. Scattered groups of protesters gathered in some neighborhoods, including several hundred who marched to the mayor's house.\nLate in the day, another group gathered in the Loop business district and marched down the city's famous Michigan Avenue. Police on horseback and bicycle kept them away from diners at outdoor cafes who ventured downtown despite wide-ranging security precautions.\nThe largest protests were expected Sunday, when thousands of people were expected to march from a band shell on Lake Michigan to the McCormick Place convention center, where NATO delegates will meet.\nAssociated Press writers Jason Keyser, Jim Suhr, Tammy Webber and Nomaan Merchant also contributed to this report.\n\nLoad-Date: May 21, 2012"
