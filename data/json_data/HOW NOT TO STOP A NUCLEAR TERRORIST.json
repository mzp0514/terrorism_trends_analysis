    "full text": "To the Editor:\n The Government's plans to restrict unclassified nuclear data (news story Aug. 16) caused me to inspect my own library with some trepidation.\nWill owning a copy of ''Studies in Nuclear Terrorism'' (published by G.K. Hall in 1979) be enough to put me in the slammer for 20 years if these regulations go into effect? Most chapters in this book were originally published by other sources, I note, including the U.S. Senate and the House.\n''Insuring Nuclear Power'' (JAI Press, 1982) sounds innocent enough, but an appendix contains 66 ''incident reports,'' and these are specifically mentioned in your article as being bad news, the kind that shouldn't get around.\nI am impressed that removal of such titles from general circulation is motivated more by a desire to prevent an informed citizenry from protesting Government nuclear policy than to protect against terrorist attack.  No one wants to abet terrorism, of course, but even old texts could be suspect: ''The Chemical Behavior of Zirconium'' (Van Nostrand, 1958) is on my shelf. Would this be useful to a terrorist? The problem is that such a title and hundreds more are essential for education and research in materials science and related fields. But will Energy Department censors be able to make this distinction? I doubt it, censors and book-burners being by nature cautious types.  I suggest that the Government would do about as well, and not cripple research, if it forgot about these regulations and merely denied tuition-aid loans to students who on their application form put down ''terrorist'' as their career goal.\n \nJAMES J. BURKE New York, Aug. 17, 1983"
