    "full text": "Health officials are adding terrorism to the nation's system of classifying death and disease to more accurately assess the impact of such attacks on public health.\nThose killed - and those who killed - in last September's attacks were the first deaths identified as homicide or suicide associated with terrorism under the changed system.\nThis allows officials to differentiate between the overall homicide toll and terrorism's victims.\nIn a report this week to the nation's public health workers, the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention unveiled an additional set of\nsubcategories for deaths and injuries specifically from terrorism.    It\nincludes such subcategories as \"terrorism involving destruction of aircraft\" and \"terrorism involving other explosions and fragments.\" Medical examiners determine cause of death according to an elaborate international system that has almost 10,000 classifications. Public health officials track those causes, which are distinct from the mode of dying, such as cardiac arrest or shock.\n\"What we hope is that these codes never get used again,\" said Dr. Robert Anderson, lead statistician in the mortality statistics branch of the National Center for Health Statistics, part of the CDC.\nInitially, all the victims from the attacks in New York, Pennsylvania and the Pentagon were listed as homicide victims, and the terrorists' deaths were counted as suicides. In the aftermath, the CDC received requests from state health officials for a uniform method of categorizing the deaths and injuries resulting from the attacks.\nThe victims, including those who jumped to their deaths from the World Trade Center towers, will still be considered homicide victims, but the CDC decided to add a layer of detail to provide a more accurate picture.\nThe change adds more than two dozen subcategories, each of which has a code.\nThe new codes are being used to classify those killed last Sept. 11 and will be used for any future deaths associated with terrorist acts, as determined by the FBI, Anderson said. A similar classification system will be used beginning next month for those injured in future terrorist attacks.\n\"It's important that we know the circumstances of the homicides, particularly in the case where we've been seeing this decline in homicides over time,\" Anderson said.\n\"Now we're going to have this blip, with 2001, this jump in the homicide rate. Well, we know that it's because of the 9/11 events.\"\nThe CDC wants to be able to understand what is happening to the homicide rate, which has been dropping nationwide -- if the 9/11 deaths are excluded.\nFor example, the homicide toll at the Pentagon, where 184 people were killed, was nearly half of Virginia's annual homicide tally in recent years.\nIf the 9/11 toll is considered part of the state's homicides for 2001, the overall total would be higher than any year since 1990, when 577 homicides were recorded.\nThe reclassification of victims was possible because medical examiners in New York and at the Pentagon noted the attacks on the death certificates, Anderson said.\nThe United States joins Israel in recognizing terrorism as a cause of death, but the subcategories are not recognized by the World Health Organization's system, he said.\nThe subcategories were developed by the health statistics center, along with the FBI and the Department of Justice, Anderson said. They are modeled on the Operations of War category used in the WHO system.\nThe international system was pioneered in the late 19th century. Almost all countries that have a death registration system in place follow the system, which has the force of an international treaty, he said.\nNew classification\nHere are subcategories the United States will now list as causes of deaths related to terrorism:\nAssault (homicide)\nTerrorism\nTerrorism involving explosion of marine weapons\nTerrorism involving destruction of aircraft\nTerrorism involving other explosions and fragments\nTerrorism involving fires, conflagration and hot substances\nTerrorism involving firearms\nTerrorism involving nuclear weapons\nTerrorism involving biological weapons\nTerrorism involving chemical weapons\nTerrorism, other specified\nTerrorism, unspecified\nSequelae (aftereffects) of terrorism\nIntentional self-harm (suicide)\nTerrorism\nTerrorism involving explosions and fragments\nTerrorism by other and unspecified means\nSource: National Center for Health Statistics\nINFO\nCLICK ON -  http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/otheract/icd9/terrorism_code.htmwere \n\nLoad-Date: September 12, 2002"
