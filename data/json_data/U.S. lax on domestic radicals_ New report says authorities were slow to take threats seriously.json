Instead, the movement was one among several instances of a broader, more diverse threat that has surfaced across the country.\n\"Our long-held belief that homegrown terrorism couldn't happen here has thus created a situation where we are today stumbling blindly through the legal, operational and organizational minefield of countering terrorist radicalization and recruitment occurring in the United States,\" said the report.\nAs a result, there is still no federal agency specifically charged with identifying radicalization or working to prevent terrorist recruitment of U.S. citizens and residents, said the report, to be released today by the Washington-based Bipartisan Policy Center's National Security Preparedness Group.\nThe group, headed by former 9-11 commission leaders Tom Kean and Lee Hamilton, laid out a detailed description of domestic terrorism incidents ranging from the Fort Hood, Texas, shooting spree and the attempted Christmas Day airliner attack in late 2009 to last May's botched truck bombing in New York's Times Square.\nOver the last year, terrorism experts and government officials have warned of the threat posed by homegrown radicals, saying terrorism recruits who go abroad could return to the U.S. to carry out attacks.\nBut the U.S., the group said, should have learned earlier from Britain's experience. Prior to the 2005 London suicide bombings, the British believed that Muslims there were better integrated, educated and wealthier than their counterparts elsewhere.\nSimilarly, the U.S. believed that its melting pot of nationalities and religions would protect it from internal radical strife, the report said.\nThe terrorists, said the report, may have discovered America's \"Achilles' heel in that we currently have no strategy to counter the type of threat posed by homegrown terrorists and other radicalized recruits.\"\nU.S. officials have acknowledged the need to address the radicalization problem, and for the first time, the White House this year added combating homegrown terrorism to its national security strategy.\nThe report also points to an \"Americanization\" of the leadership of al-Qaida and its allied groups, noting that radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who had links with suspects in the failed Times Square bombing and the Fort Hood shootings, grew up in New Mexico. And Chicagoan David Headley played a role in scoping the targets for the Lashkar-e-Taiba attacks on Mumbai in late 2008 that killed more than 160.\n\nLoad-Date: September 11, 2010"
