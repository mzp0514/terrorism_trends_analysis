    "full text": "A federal grand jury has indicted an Armstrong County man who is accused of biting two FBI agents. \nThe indictment, which was publicly filed Wednesday, charges Emerson Begolly, 21, of Redbank with two counts of inflicting bodily harm on federal officers and one count of carrying a firearm while committing a violent crime. The grand jury acted Tuesday. \nBegolly is scheduled to be arraigned Feb. 9 before U.S. Magistrate Judge Ervin Swearingen in Pittsburgh. \nThe charges stem from a Jan. 4 struggle in a New Bethlehem parking lot when the agents sought to detain Begolly while search warrants were executed on his father's house in Redbank and his mother's house in Natrona Heights. The search warrant indicates that Begolly was being investigated for providing material support to terrorists. \nFederal agents have testified that Begolly posted advice on pro-jihad websites that describe how to turn a car into a bomb, buy firearms in the United States, rig a firearm from a flare gun and sabotage railroad tracks. \nEvidence at his detention hearing include videos of Begolly wearing a camouflage jacket with Arabic patches and shouting \"Allahu Akbar\" or \"God is great\" before firing an assault-type rifle. The government contends Begolly was training to become a martyr. \n\nLoad-Date: February 2, 2011"
