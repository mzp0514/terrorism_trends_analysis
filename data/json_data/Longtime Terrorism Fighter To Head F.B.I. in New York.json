Freeh, the F.B.I. director, announced yesterday.\nThe investigator, Barry W. Mawn, will succeed Lewis D. Schiliro as the assistant director in charge of the New York office, the agency's largest. Mr. Mawn, 54, will oversee the 1,100 agents in New York City, on Long Island, and in Westchester, Rockland, Dutchess, Putnam, Orange and Sullivan Counties.\n\"Barry Mawn has distinguished himself as an investigator, supervisor and innovator,\" Mr. Freeh said in a news release.\nMr. Mawn, a former schoolteacher in Bourne, Mass., who served as a second lieutenant in the infantry, joined the agency in 1972.\nBetween 1983 and 1986, he held several different posts at F.B.I. headquarters. While in New York City early in his career, Mr. Mawn spent two years as the supervisor of the F.B.I.- Police Department Joint Terrorist Task Force.\nMr. Mawn most recently headed the bureau's Boston office, where he was assigned after a former star agent was charged with racketeering and obstruction of justice. That agent was accused of committing the crimes to protect his prized informants, including the South Boston crime boss James Bulger, whom the agent is charged with alerting about a 1995 racketeering indictment so that he could flee.\nThe problems in Boston had been developing since 1997, and a senior agency official said that Mr. Mawn had been assigned there to help clean up the office. A married father of six, Mr. Mawn has a bachelor of arts degree from Boston College and did postgraduate study at the University of Massachusetts.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: March 31, 2000"
