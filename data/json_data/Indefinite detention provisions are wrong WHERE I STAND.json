    "full text": "The Obama administration has already claimed that the president has the authority to kill Americans overseas, if he believes they are terrorists.\nNow, in the latest National Defense Authorization Act, Congress is trying to give the president the power to imprison Americans indefinitely, without charges or respect for habeas corpus, if he claims they are terrorists.\nDemocrats and Republicans in the senate have already joined hands to pass the bill.\nThis contempt for our rights is outrageous.\nAny member of Congress who supports that provision is grossly violating his or her oath to uphold the Constitution.\nIf the president thinks you are a terrorist, let him present charges and evidence to a judge.\nHe has no authority to lock you up without any judicial review, just because he and Congress believe he should have unlimited power.\nThat is the kind of power held by tyrants in totalitarian regimes.\nIt has no place in the United States.\nThe Libertarian Party opposes terrorism. We also believe our government should stop taking actions that provoke terrorism.\nWe want to end military involvement in Iraq, Afghanistan and many other countries, and we want to repeal the Patriot Act.\nFor more information, call LP Executive Director Wes Benedict at (202) 333-0008 ext. 222.\nThe LP is America's third-largest political party, founded in 1971.\nThe Libertarian Party stands for free markets, civil liberties and peace.\nYou can find more information on the Libertarian Party at announce.lp.org.\n\nLoad-Date: January 31, 2013"
