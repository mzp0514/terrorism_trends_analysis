    "full text": "Ramiken Crucible\n389 Grand Street, at Suffolk Street, Lower East Side\nThrough Oct. 21\nAndra Ursuta's rambunctious, haunted shows sure don't look like anyone else's. Her second solo at Ramiken Crucible is partly an all-out assault on the gallery format, of which Ramiken is a small, rough, downscale approximation to begin with. She has opened the gallery's interior to the outdoors simply by knocking out its immense plate-glass windows, a bit of institutional critique worthy of Michael Asher, if somewhat more violent. (Shards of shattered glass remain.)\nMeanwhile, in a dioramalike display, the gallery's back wall has been rammed and partly collapsed by a vehicle opulently encrusted with silver foam. This gleaming, quasi-comical thing-in-itself evokes both an ancient cart (a pair of boots embedded in it suggest that it once carried a ceremonial figure) and NASA's moon rover.\nIn between these two acts of possible terrorism are three life-size Social Realist marble sculptures. The news release provides salient facts and political motivation: the sculptures are based on a news photograph of an unknown Romanian Gypsy woman awaiting deportation from France that Ms. Ursuta, who is Romanian, contracted to have made in China.\nAlso here are several exceptionally striking female torsos cast (from a sculpture made by Ms. Ursata) in aluminum, iron or a combination of concrete and manure; their geometric, somewhat African mien is undercut by suggestions that the original was partly stitched together and possibly stuffed.\nBoth the marble figures and most of the cast torsos wear elaborate coin chokers or collars, using equal values of euros and American and Romanian currency, that conjure magic, decoration and armor. The exception is a torso laid on a stack of pallets like a dead warrior on a pier.\nThis exhibition contrasts systems of belief, economics and display, as well as different states of otherness. The disturbing impression is of time running backward, of civilization devolving.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/28/arts/design/andra-ursuta-magical-terrorism.html\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO: ''Commerce Exterieur  Mondial Sentimental'' (2012),  by Andra Ursuta, part of her  show at Ramiken Crucible.
