The Jan. 31-Feb. 1 meeting in Chicago was sponsored by the Property Loss Research Bureau, an affiliate of the Alliance of American Insurers in Downers Grove, Ill.\nThere are not yet any cases alleging liability for contamination, said Rebecca G. Casagrande, of Casagrande & Associates P.A. in St. Petersburg, Fla.\nWe are really ''in uncharted waters,'' said Stephen E. Goldman, an attorney with Robinson & Cole L.L.P. in Hartford, Conn.\nExisting legal theories in other types of cases, however, may help indicate whether a policyholder could turn to insurance to cover losses related to an anthrax contamination, he said.\nFor example, courts differ in their interpretation of when a policyholder's property sustains ''direct physical loss or damage.'' Some courts interpret that common phrase literally and have excluded losses ''that are purely economic in nature...including repair and remediation expenses.'' Other courts, though, have broadly interpreted such loss or damage ''to include the effect of any substance that renders insured property useless or otherwise impairs its function,'' which a court might decide includes anthrax in a facility, the attorneys said.\nIf anthrax bacteria are considered ''a pollutant,'' coverage issues arise about whether the bacteria were ''dispersed, discharged or released in the building'' and the ''proximate cause'' of the contamination, which are terms governing property insurance contracts, the attorneys said.\nFinally, potential anthrax coverage cases may turn on whether the anthrax contamination is considered ''vandalism,'' and the extent to which the policyholder purchased coverage to protect against that, Mr. Goldman said.\nBefore legal issues are resolved, though, immediate challenges for risk managers include decontaminating a worksite and salvaging valuable papers, which may require scanning or cleaning them, Mr. Goldman said. ''This is very tricky. The costs can be radically different depending on what your obligations are,'' he added.\nWhen it comes to remediation of a contaminated site, the difficult questions include ''how safe is safe and how clean is clean,'' he said.\nIn an effort to prevent coverage disputes arising from anthrax attacks in the future, the Insurance Services Office Inc. in Jersey City, N.J., has filed terrorism exclusions for commercial policies that eliminate coverage for ''any incident of terrorism that involves the use, release or escape of pathogenic or poisonous biological or chemical materials....''\nNearly every state-except notably California and New York-has adopted those exclusions for insurers to use in their states (BI, Jan. 14).\nThe issue, however, is complicated by the fact that some forms of anthrax are present in nature and may be able to survive forever, Ms. Casagrande said. But the recent incidents primarily featured an ''engineered'' form of anthrax, Mr. Goldman said.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nA cleanup crew enters the American Media Inc. headquarters in Boca Raton, Fla., where two employees contracted the anthrax virus.\n\nLoad-Date: February 14, 2002"
