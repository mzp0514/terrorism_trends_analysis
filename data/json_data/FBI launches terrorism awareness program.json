A person taking notes in a crowded park is not cause for alarm, he said, but a person videotaping the security entrance to a power plant would be of much more concern.\n\"Every time you see somebody with a notebook or a camera, you're not going to call that in,\" Caldwell said. \"If it just doesn't make sense, then maybe they should call us.\"\nCaldwell also cautioned that people who look like they're from a foreign country or a different ethnicity shouldn't be stereotyped as suspects.\nThe FBI also plans community forums starting at the beginning of 2004 where the bureau will explain how the public can help.\nCaldwell said the Fairmont terrorism task force gets anywhere from a half dozen to a dozen calls a week, and he said that is expected to increase once news of the program becomes more well-known.\nTo contact staff writer Chris Wetterich, use e-mail or call 348-3023.\n\nLoad-Date: November 13, 2003"
