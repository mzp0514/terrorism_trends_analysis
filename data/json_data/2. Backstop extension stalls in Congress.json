    "full text": "Extending the federal terrorism insurance backstop looked like a slam dunk at the beginning of 2007. The new chairmen of the relevant committees in both houses of Congress-Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee Chairman Chris Dodd, D-Conn., and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, D-Mass.-both promised to move swiftly on reauthorizing the backstop, which was slated to expire on Dec. 31.\nBut the issue was overtaken by others, and the House did not pass its backstop bill until September, with the Senate waiting until November to follow suit. The bills varied greatly in their scope. The House bill called for extending the program for 15 years and adding group life insurance to the list of lines covered by the backstop. It also called for requiring insurers to offer coverage for nuclear, chemical, biological and radiological losses. The White House threatened to veto the House bill if it should arrive on President Bush's desk.\nThe Senate bill basically called for extending the existing program for seven years, although it, like the House bill, would permit the backstop to cover acts of domestic as well as foreign terrorism. The Senate measure won administration backing.\nThe White House reiterated its veto threat last week as the House prepared to pass a ``compromise'' version of the bill, which accepted the Senate seven-year timeline and removed the NCBR provision, but kept other provisions opposed by the administration. The increasing likelihood that the backstop would expire as scheduled, leaving risk managers suddenly without terrorism coverage, made the New Year look as though it could be very unhappy indeed.\n\nLoad-Date: December 22, 2007"
