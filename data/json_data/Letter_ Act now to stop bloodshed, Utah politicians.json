    "full text": "I am just sick at heart about the continued domestic terrorism and gun violence as our politicians throw up their hands and say there is nothing they can do. Well, they can. And they must.\nThe most fundamental roll of any government is to assure national security, public safety and public health. These basics are non-negotiable and demand political leaders at every level to assure regardless of political persuasion. To maintain a blind eye by any politician, henceforth, constitutes malfeasance by any politician who refuses to take positive steps against domestic terrorism and gun violence.\nThere can be no excuse! Simply saying there are too many guns, we can't require better gun background checks or the Constitution won't allow it are all fallacious excuses on their face. We, you, must begin and begin now to address reducing domestic terrorism and gun violence.\nTo this end, I and thousands of Utahns demand that Utah politicians at every level take action now to stop domestic terrorism and gun violence. This includes Gov. Gary Herbert, Sens. Orrin Hatch and Mike Lee, Reps. Rob Bishop, Chris Stewart, Jason Chaffetz and Mia Love, Attorney General Sean Reyes, state Senate President Wayne Niederhauser and Speaker of the House Greg Hughes.\nGet on the ball and do your jobs!\nMarv Poulson\nSalt Lake City\n\nLoad-Date: December 11, 2015"
