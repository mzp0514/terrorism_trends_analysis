Other countries welcome the investment, but governments including the United States, Russia and India have expressed unease that Beijing also might be using the effort to increase its political stature.\nSpeaking before an audience that included Russian President Vladimir Putin, Xi said his government has \"no desire to impose our will on others.\" But he called for \"economic integration\" and cooperation on financial regulation, anti-terrorism and security - fields in which China's heft as the world's No. 2 economy would make it a dominant player.\n\"We should foster a vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security,\" said Xi. He called for stepped-up action against terrorism and what he called its root causes of poverty and social injustice.\nThe \"Belt and Road\" is Xi's signature foreign policy initiative. The two-day meeting that started Sunday gives the Chinese president a platform to promote his image as a global leader and free trade advocate in contrast to President Donald Trump, who has called for import restrictions.\nChina is hardly the first government to promote regional trade links. Japan has given billions of dollars in grants and low-cost loans to Southeast Asian nations to build ports and other facilities, and governments including South Korea have launched trade initiatives. But Beijing's effort is the most ambitious and is backed by China's financial muscle and status as the biggest global trader.\nChinese officials have said previously that \"Belt and Road\" is purely commercial, though Xi's comments Sunday indicated Beijing sees that as including a broad array of regulatory and other coordination with potentially far-reaching consequences.\nSome diplomats and political analysts say Beijing is trying to create a political and economic network centered on China, push the United States out of the region and rewrite rules on trade and security. The U.S. and Japan, which Beijing sees as rivals for influence in Asia, are not part of \"Belt and Road.\"\n\nLoad-Date: May 15, 2017"
