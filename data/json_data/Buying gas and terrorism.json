So, I have a car that gets 15-20 mpg, thus I support terrorism. You have a car that gets 30-35 mpg, thus you don't?\n#WES.J202MUR0.j25#\nHmmm, the gas you use isn't the same as the gas I use? Oh, right, it's OK to support terrorism a little, not a lot?\nI've seen a lot of liberal propaganda but these whackos have really outdone themselves this time. It's not that I disagree with them entirely. Honestly, I can see how gas consumption is helping these terrorists. I just don't see why they think it's OK for them to use what gas they need, and those of us who use a little more at fill-up time are the supporters of terrorism.\nHere's a concept: maybe it's the liberals themselves who are the real supporters of terrorism. After all, they're the ones who are stopping the United States from tapping into our own resources for oil, thus making us dependent on foreign oil.\nThey're the ones decrying the injustices being done to Saddam and his ilk. They're the ones condemning and accusing the United States of just about anything and everything.\nLet's all stop supporting terrorism by drilling our own resources and supplying our own oil! Then, just for fun, let's all go out and buy an SUV! Maybe with a little luck the useful idiots will have an apoplectic fit and move to Iraq.\nDavid Wesselhoft\nLancaster\nEditor's Note: The cartoon showed how ridiculous the \"SUVs support terrorism\" campaign is. It did not support it.\n\nLoad-Date: January 26, 2003"
