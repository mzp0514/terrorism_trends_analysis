Hickton announced this afternoon. \nHickton said investigators have made \"significant progress\" in the case, but provided no details. \n\"We thank the University of Pittsburgh students and community members for the information they have provided so far,\" Hickton said. \"The information has helped us to focus upon potential suspects. We encourage anyone who thinks that they may have information to continue sharing this with law enforcement.\" \nPolice have responded to bomb threats targeting more than 50 campus buildings since Feb. 13. The university is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of the person or people responsible for the threats. \nThe region's Joint Terrorism Task Force, which includes federal, state and local agencies, is investigating the threats. \nPitt evacuated five buildings this early this morning in the latest rash of threats. \nThe threat was received for Ruskin Hall, Panther Hall, Oakwood Apartments, Center Plaza Apartments and Bouquet Gardens, according to an emergency alert sent at 4 a.m. \nPolice cleared all the buildings by 6 a.m., according to follow-up alerts. \n\nLoad-Date: April 11, 2012"
