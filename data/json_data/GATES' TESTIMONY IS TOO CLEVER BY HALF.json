    "full text": "BOSTON The candor of Robert M. Gates has become a prime issue in his confirmation hearings, and one intelligence episode throws particular light on it: the 1985 CIA report stating ''the case for Soviet involvement'' in the 1981 attempt on the life of Pope John Paul II.  The character of the still-secret re port is indicated by some of its reasoning. ''The Soviets were reluctant to invade Poland'' in 1981, the report said, ''so they decided to demoralize (the Polish) opposition'' by killing the Polish pope. This tortured logic was uncharacteristic of CIA documents and was denounced in a CIA review a few months later as ''deliberately skewed.'' Yet Gates sent the report to President Reagan describing it as a ''comprehensive examination of who was behind the attempted assassination.'' In response to criticism of the papal paper, Gates testified last week: ''In retrospect, it should have been indicated that (the paper did not thoroughly examine all the alternatives that were available.'' The question is why Gates ordered such a report - and then rushed the draft through the approval process in 24 hours. The answer is evident. William Casey, the director of central intelligence then, was seized with the notion that the Russians were behind everything wrong in the world, including the attempt on the pope's life. He wanted a report to that effect, and Gates got it for him.  The antecedents of the affair, in fact, go back to the day after President Reagan was inaugurated, when Secretary of State Alexander Haig made a speech linking the Soviet Union to all the world's terrorism.\nThe State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research then commissioned a National Intelligence Estimate on the subject. When a draft of the NIE was shown to Casey some time later, he called its authors into his office.  He held up a book and said contemptuously that he had learned more from it than from all of them. The book was ''The Terror Network'' by Claire Sterling, a journalist who advanced the thesis that a Soviet conspiracy was behind the world's terrorism. CIA specialists replied that Sterling had been taken in by their own ''black propaganda,'' anti-communist tales planted in Europe by the CIA.  In 1984 she published another book: ''The Time of the Assassins,'' tracing the papal assassination attempt to a KGB plot. The CIA had actually done a study of the attack on the pope in 1983. It concluded that knowledge was fragmentary and conflicting but that there was no reason to believe in Soviet involvement. Gates briefed the Senate Intelligence Committee to that effect.  Why did Casey allow the dispassionate report in 1983, and then in 1985 have Gates order up a politicized report tuned to the Sterling thesis?  In 1983, with Yuri Andropov as Soviet leader, Soviet-American relations were at a low point. In 1985 Mikhail Gorbachev had taken over, and relations were warming up. Casey, alarmed, did what he could to keep Reagan thinking ''evil empire.'' And Gates did his bidding.  One of the witnesses against Gates said he had reluctantly decided he must speak because Gates' testimony was ''clever.'' The English have a phrase for it: ''Too clever by half.''
