The accused could get life imprisonment if found guilty.\nThe young students were arrested in December at a house in the eastern city of Sargodha, home to one of Pakistan&apos;s biggest air bases, days after their families reported them missing in the US state of Virginia.\nPakistani Police said emails showed the five men were plotting terrorist attacks in the country with the help of Islamist extremist groups.\nThe suspects claim innocence, saying they had wanted only to provide fellow Muslims with medical and financial support, while defense lawyers said the five men were en route to Afghanistan when they were arrested.\nTwo of the suspects are of Pakistani origin and the three others of Egyptian, Yemeni and Eritrean descent.\nThey accused the US and Pakistani authorities of torturing and threatening them with death while in custody.\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\nCopyright(c) 2010 RTTNews.com, Inc.
