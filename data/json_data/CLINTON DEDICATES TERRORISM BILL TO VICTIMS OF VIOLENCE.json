    "full text": "WASHINGTON (AP) - Survivors of the bombings in Oklahoma City and the\nWorld Trade Center - some of them wiping away tears - watched President\nClinton sign a bill Wednesday providing new tools and tougher penalties\nfor the war against terrorism.\nAt a ceremony on the South Lawn, Clinton told the bombing survivors and\nthe families of victims of 11 other terrorist attacks, \"We renew our\nfight against those who seek to terrorize us, in your names.\n\"We send a loud, clear message today all over the world, in your names:\nAmerica will never surrender to terror.\"\nIn a presidential election year, it was an opportunity for a warm\ndisplay of bipartisanship on a sunny, spring day. It brought Clinton\ntogether on the same stage with his GOP presidential rival, Senate\nMajority Leader Bob Dole.\nIn all, nearly two dozen members of Congress joined the president. Dole\nstood behind the president as the bill was signed, and the two leaders\nshook hands afterward.\nMore than a year in the making, the bill expands the government's power\nto exclude suspected foreign terrorists from the United States.\nAuthorities say it also will make it easier for police to trace bombs to\nthe criminals who made them, by requiring chemical markers in some\nexplosive materials.\nFurther, it imposes unprecedented curbs on federal appeals by death-row\ninmates.\nIn the South Lawn audience were 22 survivors of the Oklahoma City\nbombing a year ago, seven survivors of the 1993 World Trade Center\nbombing and four relatives of victims of Pan Am Flight 103, blown up\nover Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.\nLisa and Ilsa Klinghoffer were there. Their father, Leon Klinghoffer,\nwas killed and thrown overboard in the 1985 hijacking of the cruise ship\nAchille Lauro.\nOthers in the audience included the parents of Matthew Mitchell\nEisenfeld and Sara Duker. Engaged to be married, they were killed in a\nJerusalem bus bombing.\n\"This is a good day,\" the president said, \"because our police officers\nare now going to be better prepared to stop terrorists, our prosecutors\nbetter prepared to punish them, our people being better protected from\ntheir designs.\"\n\nLoad-Date: April 25, 1996"
