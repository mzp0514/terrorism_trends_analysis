    "full text": "FARGO (AP) - A counterterrorism expert has returned to his native Fargo to start a homeland security and research education center.\nJarret Brachman, who recently directed West Point's Combating Terrorism Center, said he wants North Dakota State University to be the place to go for strategies on keeping transportation systems secure from terrorism threats.\nThe new center will be through NDSU's Upper Great Plains Transportation Institute. Gene Griffin, director of the institute, hired Brachman to combine his counterterrorism background with the institute's transportation research.\nBrachman began his career at the CIA and went on to spend four years at West Point, where he still holds a fellow position.\nBrachman said the United States is more secure now than it was on Sept. 11, 2001, but \"al-Qaida has gotten smarter and more pervasive globally.\"\nOne of his first projects will be to examine the impact, locally and globally, of terrorist attacks against major transit hubs, including the 9/11 attacks, the 2004 Madrid train bombings and the 2005 London transit attack.\nBrachman plans to seek federal funding to develop his research and education center. He plans to teach courses at NDSU, including one on transportation security, and start a community lecture series.\n\"Things that seem so far removed from North Dakota actually do have a big impact locally,\" Brachman said.\n\nLoad-Date: September 12, 2008"
