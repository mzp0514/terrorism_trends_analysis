But he donned one throughout the prayer service Tuesday, removing it only to speak. In a sense he was following Italian law, since facemasks must now be worn indoors and out.\nHis guests followed suit, keeping their distance from and using individual pens to sign the appeal. The microphone was disinfected after each speaker finished delivering remarks about the need to work for an end to wars, hunger, terrorism and the pandemic.\nFrancis focused his remarks on the temptation to \"save yourself,\" and think of your own interests \"as if nothing else mattered.\"\n\"It is a very human instinct, but wrong,\" he said.\n\"No people, no social group, can single-handedly achieve peace, prosperity, security and happiness. None,\" he said. \"The lesson learned from the recent pandemic, if we wish to be honest, is the awareness that we are a global community, all in the same boat, where one person's problems are the problems of all.\"\n\nLoad-Date: October 21, 2020"
