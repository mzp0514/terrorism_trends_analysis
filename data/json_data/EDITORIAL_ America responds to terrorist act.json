That's what we do in our society, our nation that cherishes the freedom to go and do and see with little restriction.\nBut as was the case after 9/11 nearly a dozen years ago, normalcy now has a revised definition.\nSecurity analysts have told us over the last few years there was the potential for terrorist attacks and bombings such as we have seen in Europe, the Middle East, the Far East and elsewhere to come to our shores. On Monday, April 15, 2013, they did.\nAs President Obama confirmed Tuesday what we had suspected on Monday, this was a \"heinous cowardly act\" of terrorism. He said the investigation was still in its early stages and that investigators do not know if the bombings were the work of an international or domestic organization, or perhaps committed by a \"malevolent individual.\" Additionally, the president said this act of terrorism will not go unpunished.\nAnd he also made it clear: \"The American people refuse to be terrorized.\"\nOn Monday, a terrorist -- or a group of terrorists -- through some warped reasoning used powerful, homemade bombs to kill three people and injure nearly 200 during a popular event ingrained in the American fabric and that carries international acclaim. Now, we go forward with the realization that this kind of terror attack can happen here, too, not just in some distant place overseas. And we go forward with the understanding that we must be more vigilant, that we must be more aware of our surroundings, that we must be on guard for the terrorists among us.\nOur people and our nation were wounded on Monday, just as we were after 9/11. But we survived then, and we will again. That is the American way.\n___ (c)2013 The High Point Enterprise (High Point, N.C.)
