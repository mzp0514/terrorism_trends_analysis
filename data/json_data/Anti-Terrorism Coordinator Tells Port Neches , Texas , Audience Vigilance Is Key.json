Because terrorists are often well-funded, highly organized and, above all, hate Americans, U.S. citizens should never become complacent.\nIn addition, the threat of international terrorism can blind people to the continuing dangers of domestic terrorism, he said.\nRecently in Tyler, federal agents discovered a huge cache of weapons, sodium cyanide and forged IDs and credentials.\n\"This guy had enough weaponry to supply a small third-world country,\" Featherston said.\nA traffic stop led officers to obtain a warrant to search the Tyler property.\nFeatherston praised the cooperative relationship between industry and law enforcement in Southeast Texas. Federal and local law enforcement here likewise has \"always had a unique relationship,\" he said.\nLegislation such as the Patriot Act brings America into the modern age in terms of dealing with cellular and satellite telephones and other technology that 1970s era laws weren't adequate to address, Featherston said.\n\"We're a lot more proactive than we ever were before,\" Featherston said.\nThe Patriot Act has drawn criticism from groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and The Nation magazine. Featherston said attacks on the act are politically motivated and incorrect.\n\"There is not a search of a house, computer or phone that we don't have to go before a judge and show just cause to get a warrant for,\" Featherston said.\nAbout 250 area business, military and law enforcement officials attended the meeting Tuesday.\n\"(Featherston's presentation) helps public awareness,\" Jefferson County Sheriff Mitch Woods said. \"It lets people know what they're dealing with and what we're dealing with.\"\nCmdr. Rod Walker of the U.S. Coast Guard called Featherston's speech \"outstanding,\" and praised him for educating people.\n\"The message has to be consistent,\" Walker said. \"Everyone has to be aware. Everyone has to be diligent.\"\n-----\nTo see more of The Beaumont Enterprise, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.southeasttexaslive.com \n\nLoad-Date: March 18, 2004"
