    "full text": "Your April 7 \"Bonds Basher\" editorial answered some of the questions that arose from President Bush's remarks about worthless IOUs (\"A Social Visit,\" April 6). But the importance of the subject indicates that it shouldn't have been buried at the bottom of the page or on an inside page.\nThis subject should have been placed above the fold on the front page with big headlines and maybe a huge picture of Bush leaning over the cabinet full of bonds.\n The consequences of the government's economic failures are potentially more threatening to the American way of life than are the terrorism fears with which the government is continually trying to distract us. Americans need to be repeatedly and glaringly reminded of the fact that we are a massive debtor nation and that our Asian and European creditors can control us.\n With respect to the Social Security situation one wonders, if in the future a lot of the money is put into privately controlled accounts, then where will the government get the money it spends on other things, which it is now borrowing from the public Social Security accounts and replacing with \"worthless\" paper? There is only one believable solution to public debt -- taxes in one form or another.\n A. STRAUB\n Murrysville\n\nLoad-Date: April 14, 2005"
