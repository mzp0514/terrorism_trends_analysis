Intelligence operatives on the ground, spy satellites, communications intercepts and other clues are being used to give the military a pathway to his hideout.\nAJC\nBin Laden and his lieutenants are among 22 terrorism suspects covered by the State Department's Rewards for Justice program.\nU.S. intelligence sources said that some reputed Taliban defectors have already begun to offer tips about bin Laden's possible whereabouts, seeking partial payment of the reward money in advance.\n Pakistan beefs up border security\nPakistan has moved in tanks and additional soldiers to tighten security along its border with Afghanistan and to prevent Osama bin Laden or his fighters from coming in, officials said Thursday. Reports of fighting in southern Afghanistan have raised concerns that civilians as well as Taliban fighters may seek to escape by crossing the normally porous border with Pakistan.\n Groups declare Taliban solidarity\nJolted by the swift collapse of the Afghan Taliban militia, Pakistani Islamic groups said today would be a nationwide day of mourning and accused the military-led government of betraying the country's one-time ally. The Afghan Defense Council, an umbrella of 35 Islamic and militant groups, will hold rallies and demonstrations across the country to condemn the Northern Alliance's takeover of Kabul.\n \nBritish name liaison to help govern\nBritish Foreign Secretary Jack Straw appointed a representative to Afghanistan on Thursday to assist in formation of a new government. Stephen Evans, 51, now head of the South Asian Department at the Foreign Office, is to take up residence at the British Ambassador's compound in Kabul in the next few days. He and a small team of officials are to assist non-Taliban forces in forming a broad-based government, help rebuild state institutions and make the best use of humanitarian aid coming into the country.\n \nAid organizations pour in supplies\nWith the defeat of the Taliban, international aid agencies are sending relief workers back into Afghanistan in hopes of beating the onset of winter --- even though they still face the threat of lawlessness and looting, aid officials said. The Taliban retreat may have reduced the risk of aid operations being hit by stray bombs or angry Afghan reprisals, but the security hazards remain high, officials said.\n \nStowaway's story raises suspicions\nAn Egyptian-Canadian stowaway who was arrested on terrorism charges after he was found with high-tech equipment in an Italian port was ordered freed from prison Thursday. Amir Farid Rizk, 43, was arrested Oct. 18, the first person to be charged in Italy under a new international anti-terrorism law. He was found in a shipping container equipped with a satellite phone, raising suspicions he was part of a terrorist network. Prosecutors said Rizk had worked at one time as an aircraft mechanic on commercial jets.\n\nLoad-Date: November 16, 2001"
