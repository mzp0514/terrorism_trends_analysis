    "full text": "A Florence woman pleaded guilty to terrorism charges after sending instructions on how to make a homemade explosive device and terrorism propaganda to her incarcerated husband, Brnovich announced today. Michelle Bastian mailed the materials to Thomas Bastian, who is already serving a life sentence for a 2007 murder in the Arizona State Prison Complex-Lewis in Buckeye. \nIn May, an unnamed source told the Dept of Corrections that Thomas Bastian became a \"radicalized member of the Islamic faith,\" according to a probable cause report by the AG's office, and in September, the source revealed to the FBI that he was planning to create an explosive device intended to kill the warden or be planted in a vending machine within the prison's visitors area. A search of his cell revealed copies of Al-Qaeda's Inspire and ISIS's Dabiq, publications that contained \"detailed instructions on how to commit acts of terrorism and to praise those that have successfully carried out attacks.\" Several pages from an issue of Inspire went so far as to provide instructions on how to construct a bomb from materials \"found in your mother's kitchen.\" Michelle Bastian sent the publications, which her husband requested in several letters found during searches at her home in Florence and workplace in Chandler. She pleaded guilty to terrorism and conspiracy to commit misconduct involving weapons and faces up to 10 years in prison in addition to a lifetime on probation. Thomas Bastian is still awaiting trial on four felony charges, including terrorism, conspiracy to commit terrorism, conspiracy to commit misconduct involving weapons and conspiracy to promote prison contraband.\n\nLoad-Date: June 8, 2017"
