His name was not released.\n\"Is our system working when we see that these kind of people are running free? asked vice premier Alexander De Croo, echoing the thoughts of many in a nation where armed police and gun-toting soldiers still patrol the streets in the wake of the March 2016 attacks that left 32 people dead at the Brussels airport and subway system.\nIn Tuesday's attack, the assailant crept up on the two female officers from behind, stabbed them repeatedly, then shot them.\nThe Liege prosecutor's spokesman, Philippe Dulieu, said the attacker then shot and killed a 22-year-old teacher in a vehicle that was leaving a parking lot outside a nearby high school. He then took two women hostage inside the school before confronting police massed outside.\n\"He came out firing at police, wounding a number of them, notably in the legs. He was shot dead, the spokesman said, adding that the hostages escaped unharmed.\n- the associated press\n\nLoad-Date: May 31, 2018"
