    "full text": "To the Editor:\nNumerous questions about President Reagan's secret arms deals with Iran remain unanswered.\nThe first relates to the Administration's contention that arms deals with Teheran go back only 18 months. With Washington's consent and probably encouragement, Israeli shipments of spare parts for U.S.-made weapons to Iran date back possibly as early as 1980, when the Iran-Iraq war started.\nThe Reagan Administration has previously approved direct sales of militarily useful items to Iran, such as jeeps in 1984. Export controls were tightened that September after outstanding claims by U.S. companies against Teheran had been settled.\nPresident Reagan contends that selling arms to Iran could help end Teheran's war with Iraq. That's like saying that to extinguish a fire one had best throw in a couple of firecrackers. With U.S. economic and intelligence assistance to Iraq, however, the arms transfers to Iran appear more like a policy to prolong the war and prevent victory by either side.\nSecondly, criticism of the arms sales has focused exclusively on Iran, a Government widely considered to have humiliated the U.S. But most objectionable should be the notion that improving relations with any country is best accomplished by dispensing weapons. Under this Administration, military power has become a cornerstone of foreign policy: friends and others we want to influence receive arms; foes get bombed or invaded. Can the U.S. offer the world nothing else than means of destruction?\nFinally, the Iranian episode should teach us about the uses and abuses of the term ''terrorism.'' Because charges of ''support for international terrorism'' are vague and seldom substantiated, they facilitate inflating and de-emphasizing the ''terrorist threat,'' like flipping a lightswitch on and off. Thus, President Reagan defends his Iran deal by saying that Iranian-sponsored terrorism against Americans ended since the arms transfers began. A few days later, the terrorism charge is resurrected by his aides. The ''incontrovertible proof'' of Libyan involvement in a West Berlin disco bombing was suddenly transformed into evidence of Syrian ''masterminding.''\nThe Administration has been put on the defensive because of the immense dislike of the Iranian regime. Had the Democrats been equally determined to challenge policies toward Nicaragua and South Africa, for example (just as indefensible as the gun running to Iran), U.S. foreign policy might be on a more sensible and principled footing.\nLet us hope the Iran episode will lead to a reappraisal of the means and goals of foreign policy and the proper use of Presidential powers and privileges.\n \nMICHAEL G. RENNER\n   Research Associate\n   World Policy Institute\n   New York, Nov. 24, 1986"
