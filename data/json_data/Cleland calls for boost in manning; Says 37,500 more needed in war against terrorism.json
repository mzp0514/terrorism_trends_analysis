    "full text": "A key senator is calling for adding 37,500 active-duty members to the military above what the Bush administration has requested, a move in line with a House proposal but opposed by the administration for cost reasons.\nSen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services military personnel panel, said the armed forces need the extra people to achieve decisive victory in the war against global terrorists.\n\"Under the new rules, terrorists have to lose, or else they'll come back after us again,\" Cleland told a National Press Club audience in Washington on May 16. Cleland is a disabled Vietnam combat veteran who lost both legs and his right arm in a grenade blast.\nThe services have testified they need another 40,000 people to meet current missions, including the war on terrorism. But Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and the Bush administration have said they first want thorough studies within the services to see if troops are performing obsolete missions or unnecessary duties.\nThe House version of the 2003 defense authorization bill includes an increase of 12,652 active-duty personnel, about 1 percent over current levels. That would be the biggest jump since 1986.\nOn paper, the armed forces are authorized 1.38 million active-duty members this fiscal year. In reality, the number is closer to 1.5 million because tens of thousands of reservists have been called to active duty for the war on terrorism. Thousands more active-duty members in critical specialties have been forced to stay in uniform past the end of their obligations because of the war.\nThe Bush administration has requested only 2,400 additional Marines for next year.\nCleland proposes an additional 3,500 airmen, 5,000 soldiers and 3,500 sailors for 2003.\nHis plan also would add about 2,500 airmen in 2004 and about 2,000 more in 2005, and 5,000 soldiers a year in 2004 through 2007. He would add an additional 1,000 sailors in 2004.\nAll told, the 40,000 extra people would represent nearly a 3 percent increase over today's manpower.\nFor 2003, the extra personnel would cost about $550 million more than the Pentagon wants to spend on military manpower. The Army projects it will spend $15,956 recruiting each soldier next year, so bringing an additional 5,000 into the force would cost $79.8 million.\nIn a May 9 statement to Congress, the White House Office of Management and Budget formally opposed the House plan to increase military manpower next year.\n\"The increases â€¦ are not necessary to sustain the war on terrorism and support other security requirements and would undermine efforts currently under way to establish the most effective utilization of military resources,\" the White House statement said.\nStudies to be completed by late summer will influence decisions \"on how to match resources to the areas that require unique military skills and how to focus military manpower on the most critical missions, while reducing operations and personnel tempo.\"\nHowever, Cleland was critical of current administration policies that force members to stay on active duty to avoid shortages .\n\"You can't get out even if you want to,\" he said. \"This is no way to fight a war.\"\nHe said the Sept. 11 attacks proved that terrorists must be decisively defeated. And rooting them out will take extra people in uniform.\n\"It is labor intensive, people intensive,\" Cleland said. \"We do have to go into places in the world we never thought we'd have to stick our nose in.\"\nHe said the global war on terrorism is a \"race against time\" to prevent America's enemies from getting and using unconventional weapons that could kill large numbers of civilians.\n\nNotes\n\n1 COLOR PHOTO\n\nLoad-Date: June 18, 2004"
