    "full text": "New President, new approach to criminal justice and terrorism, same damn problem: advanced encryption technology is making it impossible for cops and prosecutors to unlock smartphones where crucial evidence lives.\nPer Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance, prosecutors in that county alone are holding 423 lawfully obtained iPhones and iPads that can't be cracked, representing a third of all such devices recovered since October 2014.\nThe owner of the device could in theory open it with a special passcode - but the owner is either uncooperative or deceased.\nOne out of 10 of those devices likely holds evidence that could be instrumental in a murder case. Nearly the same percentage could help solve, or convict - or exonerate - someone in a sex crime.\nEspecially painful: Sometimes a homicide victim's own phone contains relevant evidence, but since he or she was cut down, and the password died too, the killer can't be found.\nAs ever more evidence migrates from the physical world to the virtual one, as Google, Apple, Facebook and others develop ever more sophisticated technology to guard against hackers and the government, this portends a bleak future.\nTough-talking Donald Trump promises to restore law and order, to bring crime and terrorism to heel. He also advertises himself as a brilliant dealmaker with a unique talent for bringing parties together.\nTech companies and the government are currently engaged in a destructive cold war that's making life ever easier for bad actors.\nWhat's Trump's bright idea?\n\nGraphic\n\n \nNLVL\n\nLoad-Date: November 27, 2016"
