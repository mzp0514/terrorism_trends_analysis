In addition, many ad hoc court procedures for managing terrorism trials have been effective - but there is a steep learning curve for judges and courthouses trying terrorist suspects, the report states.\nSome challenges associated with terrorism trials are posed by constitutionally-mandated safeguards, and the reports suggests the use of an alternative forum - such as a national security court - may not alleviate those challenges.\nThe report was generated by an April workshop with 33 national security practitioners and experts. Some participants suggested that a backstop to the Article III court framework may be required to deal with terrorist suspects who may pose a threat to national security but who cannot be prosecuted successfully.\nThe full report is available online at www.abanet.org/natsecurity. A third report, \"Exploring Counterterrorism Detention Alternatives\" will be released in August.\n\nLoad-Date: July 28, 2009"
