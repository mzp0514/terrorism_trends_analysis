    "full text": "AN ALL-OUT search was launched Sunday by the NYPD and federal law enforcement for the terrorists who set off a bomb on a crowded Manhattan street - and planned to detonate a second one four blocks away.\nA source with knowledge of the probe said officials are pursuing information that the blast on W. 23rd St. between Sixth and Seventh Aves. around 8:30 p.m. Saturday was an act of terror and not the work of a random person.\nCops and federal agents were trolling through all available evidence - including a scrap of paper found in the second device, a pressure cooker filled with explosives and wired to a flip-style cell phone.\nThe most tantalizing evidence includes a video of a man dropping something into or beside the dumpster on W. 23rd St. where an explosive device detonated injuring 29 and flooding the area with NYPD and FDNY responders, a police source said.\nCops also had video of a man leaving a piece of luggage at the second site on W. 27th St. where another unexploded device was found.\nAfter he left, two other people stopped and removed the device from the bag. They took the luggage with them and left the device behind, the police source said.\nGov. Cuomo, who toured the scene early Sunday with Mayor de Blasio, said nothing so far linked the explosions to any overseas extremist groups. But a bomb going off in the city was \"obviously an act of terrorism,\" he added.\n\"When you see the damage, we were fortunate there were no fatalities,\" he said.\nThe mayor wouldn't say it was a terrorist act, saying only that it was \"intentional.\"\nThe bomb that exploded was dropped in a dumpster near a residence for the blind. Its ground-shaking detonation blew out windows and sent shrapnel flying as pedestrians ran for their lives.\nThe NYPD said that bomb was \"similar\" to the second device found four blocks away on W. 27th St. three hours later by two state troopers sweeping the area.\n\"The materials found, twisted metal, are consistent with the type of metal used in cookware, including pressure cookers,\" said a police source.\nBoth devices were filled with small ball bearings or metal BBs, The New York Times reported, similar to the pressure-cooker bombs the Tsarnaev brothers detonated at the Boston Marathon in 2013.\nThe NYPD issued a heightened alert for the city and all its officers after the bomb squad realized the second device was \"live\" - meaning it could have gone off if it hadn't been found, the source said.\nCops also checked out a Tumblr page posted Sunday from someone claiming responsibility for the violence.\n\"I'm the NY Bomber,\" the page (inset) declared, above a \"manifesto\" that said the blasts were meant to further gay rights and bring attention to LGBTQ issues.\nThe site was being vetted like all tips, officials said, and later discredited.\nAn unknown man also called an NYPD facility right after the bomb went off and told cops \"there is going to be more,\" the source said.\nBut it wasn't clear if the caller had any connection to the blast or was just an angry person, the source said.\nThe unexploded device was removed about 2:25 a.m. and taken to the department's firing range at Rodmans Neck in the Bronx. Cops defused it late Sunday.\nSome of the evidence would be sent to an FBI lab in Quantico, Va., for analysis, Cuomo said.\nAfter his rare public appearance alongside Cuomo, the mayor held a press briefing with his new top cop, Police Commissioner James O'Neill.\n\"It was intentional. It was a violent act. It was certainly a criminal act. It was a bombing. That's what we know,\" de Blasio said, insisting it was too early to say if it was terrorism.\nThe mayor and NYPD officials said investigators were exploring whether the Chelsea bombing was connected to an explosion of pipe bombs earlier Saturday in New Jersey but didn't give details.\nBut law enforcement officials found that all three devices were designed to be detonated using a cell phone as a trigger, ABC News reported, citing police sources.\nAl Della Fave, spokesman for the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office, said the FBI took over its probe Sunday.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nGov.
