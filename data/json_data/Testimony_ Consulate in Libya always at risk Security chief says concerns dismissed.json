Col. Andrew Wood said in testimony at a hearing of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\nThe Republican-led committee was meeting to investigate the deaths of U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens and three other Americans on Sept. 11 at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi. Among the testimony's revelations was that Stevens had requested additional security because of the danger and, according to a former chief of security, was denied.\n\"The security conditions in Libya remains unpredictable, volatile and violent,\" Stevens wrote.\nThe hearing followed assertions Tuesday by the State Department that it never concluded that the attack arose from protests over an American-made video ridiculing Islam.\nEven so, administration official U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice gave a series of interviews five days after the attack in which she asserted the attack was a spontaneous reaction to the film. White House spokesman Jay Carney also blamed the video days after the incident.\nState Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland also refused for days afterward to say the assault on the compound was a terror attack, saying the matter was still being investigated. The administration now says it was a terrorist attack.\nState Department officials said that security levels at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, were adequate but that the compound was overrun in an \"unprecedented\" attack by dozens of heavily armed extremists.\n\"We had the correct number of assets in Benghazi at the time of 9/11,\" said Charlene Lamb, the deputy secretary of State for diplomatic security in charge of protecting American embassies around the world.\nFive security agents were on the compound Sept. 11, Lamb said.\nNoting that four Americans were killed, Carney said Wednesday that in hindsight, \"there is no question that the security was not enough to prevent that tragedy from happening.\"\nAccording to documents made public at the hearing, Stevens sent a cable Aug. 2 to the State Department asking for 11 additional bodyguards to be added to the roster of 24 to replace temporary-duty officers who would be leaving within the next month.\n\"Due to the level of threat in regards to Crime, Political Violence and Terrorism, Post feels this is an appropriate number of LES security personnel needed to further Embassy diplomatic outreach missions,\" Stevens wrote.\n\"Violent security incidents continue to take place due to the lack of a coherent national Libyan security force and the strength of local militias and large numbers of armed groups,\" Stevens wrote. \"Host national security support is lacking and cannot be depended on to provide a safe and secure environment.\"\nWood, the former head of a 16-member U.S. military team in Libya, testified that the attack was \"instantly recognizable\" to him as terrorism. A former Special Forces soldier who commanded the Site Security Team in Libya from Feb. 12 until Aug. 14, Wood said the attacks on the nearby British Embassy and International Red Cross made it apparent that \"we were the last target on their list.\"\n\"The security in Benghazi was a struggle and remained a struggle throughout my time there,\" Wood said. \"The RSO (regional security officer) struggled to obtain additional personnel there but was never able to attain the numbers he felt comfortable with.\"\nEric Nordstrom, the former chief security officer for U.S. diplomats in Libya, testified that it was clear when he arrived in Libya that the  government was too weak and fragmented to provide consistent diplomatic security. The State Department, he said, recognized this weakness.\n\"Libyans wanted to help, but they had very limited capabilities to do so,\" Nordstrom said, adding that his pleas for more security were ignored.\nNordstrom said his requests for more security were blocked by a department policy to \"normalize operations and reduce security resources.\"\nNordstrom said he sent two cables to State Department headquarters in March and July requesting additional diplomatic security agents for Benghazi, but he received no responses. He said Lamb wanted to keep the number of U.S. security personnel in Benghazi artificially low even as the State Department recognized the increasing hazards.\n---\nTimeline of Libya attack\nApril-June: Several security threats occur against U.S. installations in Libya.\nJuly: An American real estate developer releases on YouTube a 13-minute trailer for Innocence of Muslims, an anti-Islam video.\nSept. 11: Egyptians attack the U.S. Embassy in Cairo.
