K.\nDagat of the Federal High Court sitting in Kano, Kano State Wednesday convicted and sentenced Saad Ahmed Madaki to ten years imprisonment. He was arraigned by the Kano Zonal office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on one- count charge of obtaining money under false pretense.\n Troubles came for the convict when he was arrested by the Kano State Joint Task Force, on an allegation that he was connected to terrorism. He was handed over to the Department of State Security Service but was later transferred to the EFCC when he could not be linked to terrorism in any way.\n However, further investigations showed that he defrauded and obtained the sum of Two Hundred Million Naira (N200,000,000.00) fraudulently from one Auwalu Abdulkadir, a retired Kano State Treasurer. Upon arraignment on April 4, 2017, he pleaded not guilty to the charge against him which prompted the trial.\n  Prosecution Counsel, Douglas I. Gift, presented five witnesses and seven exhibits to the court to establish Madaki's guilt.\n Justice Dagat found him guilty as charged. He was convicted and sentenced to ten years imprisonment.\n The Judge also ordered him to pay a sum of Two Hundred Million Naira he fraudulently obtained from the petitioner as restitution to the lawful owner. \n\nLoad-Date: July 22, 2020"
