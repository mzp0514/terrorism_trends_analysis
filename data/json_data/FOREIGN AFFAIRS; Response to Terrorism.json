Now there is the lost Air India plane and the explosion in Tokyo airport to add to a single week's headlines about hostages in Beirut and the blast at Frankfurt. Apart from the obvious need to insist on observing security precautions, there is a need to fight this international epidemic. President Reagan said he will name a task force to make recommendations. What the U.S. decides to do, he said wisely, ''must not be done in pointless anger,'' though his press spokesman underlined the sobering effect by saying he ''could not rule out military action'' of retaliation once the American hostages are safe.\nMilitary reprisal, proportionate, or as some are even arguing, deliberately disproportionate, cannot stop this plague. It would only escalate disorder and distress, which is precisely the purpose of terrorism. It must be understood that the demands made by those who flout civilized rules are secondary to them. Their prime goal is to give importance to their cause by sowing fear.\nFlora Lewis column urges forging of international convention against terrorism; says any nation that refuses to sign and apply its rules would brand itself a supporter of terrorism for all the world to see and draw conclusions about air transport, tourism, trade, credit and other benefits of membership in international community\nSo the response must be a strong international consensus to treat them as common criminals and make sure they are punished as such. This has seldom been possible until now because it is individual nations that must apply law and, individually, they have been reluctant to do it. Some states have refused because, in fact if not in words, they support some terrorists and expect to benefit from the crime. Most seek to avoid responsibility because they are more afraid of the terrorists than of law-abiding opinion and hope that if they look the other way, so will the criminals.\nThe time may be at hand to change attitudes. It happened before when a great preponderance of world opinion was ready for it. International conventions on abolition of slavery and treatment of prisoners of war are examples. They have induced nations to shift from looking over one shoulder in fear of outlaws to looking over the other shoulder for fear of being ostracized.\nThe desire for international legitimacy is a powerful motive, even for dictators and despots. There should now be an international convention against terrorism. Any country that refuses to sign and apply the rules would brand itself a supporter of terrorism for all the world to see and draw conclusions about air transport, tourism, trade, credit and other benefits of membership in the international community.\nAt a minimum, the convention should oblige signatories either to prosecute anyone involved with a terrorist act as principal accomplice, or else to extradite those charged to a country that wants to prosecute. Refusal to arrest and prosecute or extradite would signify complicity, and not be excused as frightened impotence as is now the usual case.\nInterpol or some such agency should be charged with drawing up a centralized list of everyone identified with terrorism. It would be a duty of signatories to provide all information they acquire, and a duty to arrest any person on the list if he or she turns up on a member state's territory at any time.\nThe requirements should be firm but not excessively inclusive and as nonpolitical as possible. It is more important to achieve very broad agreement among all countries that wish to be part of civilized society than to write stringent rules that won't be applied and will leave governments in their current lonely dilemma.\nBecause terrorism must be deprived of its political ambitions, the United Nations is not an appropriate sponsor. With its habit of florid rhetoric and sordid log-rolling, the U.N. would turn the effort into a futile free-for-all of recrimination. It tried once to take up the issue and bogged down hopelessly in arguing how to define terrorism. The crimes are clear - taking hostages and planting bombs in a context that involves more than one nation.\nBut neither should the U.S. take the lead too visibly. That would risk turning the question into being pro- or anti-American, even with regard to a particular U.S. policy, when the question to put quite directly is being pro- or anti-terrorism.\nThe European Community could well take the initiative, all the more because it would start with the authority of a dozen states. It means something that Greece felt the need to offer an explanation of its behavior to its Common Market partners after T.W.A. Flight 847 was hijacked from Athens. There is some more pressure available here, and if the appeal is properly handled, Communist and most third-world states could be expected to join.\nThese are cynical times. The temptation is to lose patience with attempts to establish a bit of law in the world. But without striving for law, there is nothing left but force, which cannot assure safety from fanatics."
