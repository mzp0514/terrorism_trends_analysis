    "full text": "Terrorists, gang members are similar\nBrussels is not just a terrorist attack around the world, but a reminder of our own failures as a society. The profile of a terrorist of today fits the same profile of the gang member of today and yesterday.\nAll of them are young men left behind. They lack structure in their lives, many have no traditional family to speak of, and no job or career they can ever dream of having.\nThe gang provides a sense of \"self\" and a purpose. They are given titles and jobs, a sense of importance and belonging, something they have never experienced before. The members I worked with didn't mind dying young. They would be martyrs, held in revere by their peers. Their mother and little sister would be taken care of and they would have a burial.\nThe international terrorist lacks a future as well. They too are told they will be martyrs.\nThere was a time economically when these geographic hotbeds of gangs and local terrorism could have been wiped out with corporate investment in education and employment. Oh, there were \"attempts,\" but few went in and most stayed away.\nWithout an identity and a sense of self on which the young male individual thrives, there will be no future other than that of more terrorism and the \"disbelief\" and confusion of: How could this happen?\nKaren Spencer\nGeneva\n\nLoad-Date: April 11, 2016"
