    "full text": "A recent poll was conducted to determine present attitudes of US citizens about travel abroad. I believe the result was that 2 out of 3 citizens said they would either hesitate to go abroad, or simply would not go.\nExcept for the terrorists themselves, everybody, I suppose, is against terrorism. But simply being against it is not doing much to correct it. Correcting and eliminating it requires understanding the conditions that produce it, knowing what motivates it, and wiping out these conditions and motives.\nWhat prompts most terrorist acts is accumulated frustration about altering situations perceived to be unjust. The healing of injustice would do much more to overcome terrorism than anything else - certainly than playing provocative war games in the Gulf of Sidra and elsewhere.\nEver since the end of World War II - during which the US enjoyed a ''reservoir of goodwill'' (Wendell Willkie's phrase) virtually around the globe - anti-Americanism has been building up. Some have been trying for decades to get their points across to the US. Now it is no longer just mental attitudes, hostile words, and slogans; it has crossed over into terrorist acts.\nInsofar as the US has participated in the creation or perpetuation of unjust situations, it bears some responsibility for the terrorism it opposes. It should, therefore, review its acts and amend as completely as it can those that have helped to produce or perpetuate this injustice.\nCarroll Cole, New Haven, Conn.\nLetters are welcome.
