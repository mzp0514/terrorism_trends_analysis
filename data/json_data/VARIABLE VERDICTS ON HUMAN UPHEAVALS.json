    "full text": "To the Editor:\nYour July 14 editorial ''The Riot Experts,'' on the very different and almost reflexive reactions of liberals and conservatives to urban rioting, raises in my mind some non-ideological questions, not only about rioting but also about such somewhat kindred activities as terrorism and revolution.\nAlmost everyone seems to agree that rioting is extremely undesirable (but in the liberal view sometimes useful as an attention-getter); terrorism is totally wrong (although sometimes overlookable, if not entirely forgivable, as in the case of the I.R.A., Kenyatta and Begin), and revolution is good if engaged in constructively and successfully by people who speak English or French (speakers of Russian, Spanish and Chinese are generally unable to engage in constructive revolutions).\nWilliam Halsey letter responds to July 14 editorial discussing different reactions of liberals and conservatives to urban rioting\nTo those conservatives who truly believe that all are totally and invariably wrong, and who wish to have done with them entirely, one can commend the Soviet system, under which the incidence of all three appears to be quite minimal.\nTo those liberals who truly be-lieve that some ends can justify any means, one can commend history, by which (after the fact) all success is rewarded and all failure punished.\nAnd to the rest of us, who have to live with such complicated realities as Liverpool, Detroit and Belfast, I commend the painfully difficult but civilized approach you suggest: ''The overwhelming imperative is (indeed) to halt disorder with sensitivity and force.''\nWILLIAM D. HALSEY, New York, July 14, 1981"
