There's no better time than this, even to spend one night in jail given what this administration is doing.\nRUTH BENN\nWar Resisters League Bookkeeper/desktop publisher Brooklyn, N.Y.\nIf we are calling this terrorism, where 3,000 people are killed, then we must also call it terrorism when we are bombing Baghdad and Afghanistan, killing tens of thousands of people. If it's terrorism here, it's terrorism there.\nMIKE LEVINSON\nWar Resisters League Library clerk New Rochelle, N.Y.\nJohnny Cash came from poor people. ... For these people to get up here in his name would make him roll over in his grave.
