    "full text": "University of Mary percussion major Ben Wahlund will use his marimba to transport the audience to a town wracked by terrorism.\nWahlund presents his junior recital Sunday at 3 p.m. in the University of Mary's Arno Gustin Hall.\nWahlund's program includes the North Dakota premiere of Saranda, a composition by Mehdi Mengjigi.\nIn researching the piece, Wahlund found that Saranda is the name of a town in Albania that has been afflicted with terrorism.\nHe tried, unsuccessfully, to contact the composer about this contemporary, demanding piece. Mengjigi is in Poland.\n\"My roommate is Polish and translated a letter for me, but I couldn't get it to him (Mengjigi,)\" says Wahlund. \"I'm speculating, but based on the music and title it (the composition) may have to do with the terrorism in Saranda.\"\nBut \"Saranda\" is not the only interesting piece in Wahlund's repertoire. In a multi-percussion piece called \"Concerto pour Petite Orchestre at Batterie\" by Darius Milhaud, Wahlund plays 12 different instruments ranging from timpani and snare drums to a cow bell and triangle.\nThe other pieces he will perform are all played on marimba.\nWahlund, the son of Bob and Nancy Wahlund of Valley City, majors in music education and performance with minors in theology/philosophy and math.\nHe is active in jazz band, concert band, concert choir, wind ensemble, University Singers, percussion ensemble, small jazz ensembles, Friends of Big Brother/Big Sister and tutoring.\nThe recital is free and open to the public.\n\nLoad-Date: January 15, 1998"
