    "full text": "Five years after 9/11, Americans recognize that there is no such thing as complete protection from terrorism. The best we can do is to focus our prevention efforts - and money - where they are most needed.\nSince Sept. 11, 2001, the United States has not suffered any major terrorist incidents. Unlike London. Unlike Madrid. Americans might take some comfort in that. But that could change at any moment.\nFurther, Americans cannot say no terrorism has occurred on U.S. soil the past five years. Consider:\n* In March, an Iranian immigrant drove an SUV into a crowd of students on campus at the University of North Carolina; nine victims required hospital care. Mohammed Taheri-azar said he intended to kill people to avenge the treatment of Muslims. Isn't that terrorism? What if his weapon had been a bomb instead of an SUV?\n* In July, a Muslim man \"angry about Israel\" shot and killed one person and wounded five others at the Jewish Federation in Seattle.\nNo matter how many restrictions and safeguards are instituted, acts of terrorism can occur.\nSo, how can government possibly discern where an attack might happen and how much should be spent to guard against it?\nUnfortunately, too much of the money spent in the name of homeland security - the current budget is $34 billion! - did little more than fulfill the pork-barrel demands of federal lawmakers. Small towns in Northeast Iowa, Southwest Wisconsin and Northwest Illinois are not likely to be terrorist targets. But nearly everybody received a slice of the homeland security funding pie.\nAmong sites the government considered vulnerable to attack were Old MacDonald's Petting Zoo, the Amish Country Popcorn factory and the Mule Day Parade. Really.\nWhat does it tell you when Indiana is listed the state with the most potential terror targets (8,591)? That is 50 percent more sites than in New York, and twice as many as in California. Meanwhile, the government cut counterterrorism funding for New York City and Washington, D.C., by 40 percent this summer as homeland security officials juggled \"priorities.\"\nThis is wrong.\nEven if we had enough money to throw around and protect every flea market and corn boil, would that really keep terrorists at bay? It's doubtful.\nIf we have learned anything in the past five years, it should be that we cannot \"terrorist-proof\" our entire country. But we can give serious attention to our greatest vulnerabilities. There are transportation facilities (bridges, depots, airports and docks) and the vehicles that use them. There are major governmental and corporate buildings. There are major sites for sport, tourism and entertainment. The list goes on - and yet, no place can be totally protected from a terrorist threat. So government should devote its attention and resources to the places most likely to be targeted - without regard to how much taxpayer money flows to which congressional district.\nGovernment waste and inefficiency in homeland security - unlike the usual waste and inefficiency - is more than frustrating. It is dangerous and immoral.\nEditorials reflect the consensus of the Telegraph Herald Editorial Board: Jim Normandin (Publisher), Brian Cooper, Ken Brown, Monty Gilles, Amy Gilligan and Sharon Welborn.\n\nLoad-Date: September 11, 2006"
