He also allegedly sought information on the tallest building in a major U.S. city and information on obtaining a U.S. visa, the indictment said.\nAl Shabab is Al Qaeda's affiliate in East Africa and responsible for numerous terrorist attacks, including a Jan. 15, 2019, siege at a hotel in Nairobi, Kenya, that killed 21 people. Among the dead was an American survivor of the 9/11 attacks.\nThe terrorist group recently launched \"Operation Jerusalem Will Never Be Judaized\" in response to the decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, prosecutors said.\n\"Nearly 20 years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, there are those who remain determined to conduct terror attacks against United States citizens,\" FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William Sweeney Jr. said.\n\nLoad-Date: December 17, 2020"
