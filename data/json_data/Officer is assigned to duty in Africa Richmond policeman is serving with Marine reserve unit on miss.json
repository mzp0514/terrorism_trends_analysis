Abdillahi-Farrah, to help the multilingual official polish his command of English.\n \"We work . . . on his pronunciation, reading, writing, grammar,\" DeGrauwe said. \"The conversations could go from just reading and pronunciation all the way up to world events or events in Djibouti. Wherever we end up, we end up.\"\n DeGrauwe, who also did a tour of duty in Iraq in 2005 as first sergeant of a combat engineer company, is one of more than 1,800 U.S. service members, civilians and coalition allies taking part in the American-led Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa.\n He's doing a seven-month tour in Djibouti - searing hot, desert dry and 7,318 miles from Richmond.\n The former French colony is located at the Red Sea's southern end, a region known as the Horn of Africa. Somewhat smaller than Massachusetts, Djibouti - pronounced \"Jih-BOO-tee\" - has an impoverished, overwhelmingly Muslim population estimated at roughly half a million.\n The nation hosts the only U.S. military base in sub-Saharan Africa. Regional politics are frequently tense and transnational terrorism poses a threat to East Africa, the U.S. State Department says.\n America's growing presence in Djibouti reflects the country's strategic location near the world's busiest shipping lanes and close to Arabian oilfields, as well as its willingness to help the U.S. fight terrorism, wrote W. Stuart Symington, the American ambassador to Djibouti.\n DeGrauwe, 46, is married with three children. His wife, Suzanne, is no stranger to the stresses of military life: She's a retired Marine master sergeant.\n \"She knows all about the deployments, she knows all about the combat,\" DeGrauwe said. And, \"she's close to a saint.\"\n Suzanne DeGrauwe is comfortable with the potential dangers of her husband's work. \"Once you've been in a job for so long, you just kind of do it,\" she said, pointing out that, \"It's a volunteer force. It's not like they were drafted.\"\n DeGrauwe spent more than 10 years on active duty with the Marines before moving into law enforcement. He's been a Richmond police officer since 1995, and had a stint on the SWAT team.\n \"His commitment is just tremendous, all the way round,\" said Richmond police Sgt. David Wallis, who serves with DeGrauwe on South Side and worked with him on the SWAT team. \"He represents us well.\"\n The Combined Joint Task Force has its headquarters at the nearly 500-acre Camp Lemonier. The task force is in the business of helping ordinary people, not shooting at enemy forces, the Pentagon says.\n Since 2002, the task force's doctors, civil engineers, veterinarians and well-drillers have built schools, clinics and hospitals, made dozens of medical, dental and veterinary visits, dug more than 20 wells, and pitched in on a dozen humanitarian-assistance missions.\n \"We need to affect the next generation, the kids of today,\" DeGrauwe said. \"If they're growing up knowing the Americans are good people, that we're generous, maybe they'll come to our side rather than leaning toward terrorism.\n \"There are a lot of good people outside the wire,\" he said, \"and they like Americans.\"\nOn duty in Djibouti\nThe small East African country of Dijbouti is home to an important U.S. military hub in the volatile Horn of Africa.\nContact Peter Bacqu√© at (804) 649-6813 or pbacque@timesdispatch.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO, MAP\n\nLoad-Date: July 27, 2007"
