    "full text": "An animal rights activist pleaded not guilty Tuesday to domestic terrorism charges that he freed mink from Midwestern farms in 1997, causing thousands of dollars in damage and spreading fear through the nation's fur farmers.\nPeter Daniel Young, 27, made the plea in U.S. District Court in Madison as he appeared for the first time on the charges after eluding authorities for more than seven years.\nJudge Theresa M. Owens ordered Young held without bail, saying he is \"a flight risk and danger to the community.\"\nInvestigators say Young is part of the Animal Liberation Front, a radical group that aims to destroy animal-related industries. An FBI official said last week ALF and similar groups are the nation's top domestic terrorism threat.\nProsecutors say Young and accomplice Justin Samuel set out to cripple the fur industry in 1997, freeing more than 7,000 mink from their cages at five farms in Iowa, South Dakota and Wisconsin.\nThe two were indicted in 1998 on four counts of interference with commerce by threat or violence and two counts of animal enterprise terrorism. Young, originally of Mercer Island, Wash., faces 82 years in prison.\nAuthorities in 1999 picked up Samuel, who agreed to cooperate in exchange for a two-year prison sentence. Young was a fugitive until March when he was arrested on a shoplifting charge after stealing some CDs from a Starbucks in San Jose, Calif.\nAuthorities extradited Young on Monday to Wisconsin, the nation's largest mink producing state.\n\nLoad-Date: May 25, 2005"
