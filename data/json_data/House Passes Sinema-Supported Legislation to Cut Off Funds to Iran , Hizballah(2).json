These bipartisan bills are important tools to combat terrorist financing and protect America's safety and security.\"\nThe House of Representatives passed the Iran Ballistic Missiles and International Sanctions Enforcement Act (H.R. 1698), Sanctioning Hizballah's Illicit Use of Civilians as Defenseless Shields Act (H.R. 3342), and Hizballah International Financing Prevention Amendments Act (H.R. 3329), all co-sponsored by Congresswoman Sinema.\nCongresswoman Sinema serves on the House Financial Services' Terrorism and Illicit Finance subcommittee.
