    "full text": "To the Editor:\nRepresentatives Charles B. Rangel and Benjamin A. Gilman are absolutely right when they argue that marijuana growers are not pillars of society (''The Myth of the Peaceful Marijuana Farmer,'' letter, Dec. 4). However, they make a logical error when using that as a reason for a continued war on marijuana producers.\nOne has only to look at this nation's history during Prohibition to see that when you make something illegal, large numbers of people will do it regardless of the legality of the act. You create the environment in which criminals thrive. If you legalize marijuana production and use, I doubt that these farmers would be out patrolling their land with Uzi submachine guns.\n''Keeping the Drug Laws,'' the letter from Francis M. Mullen Jr., Drug Enforcement Administrator, is guilty of similar non sequiturs. That marijuana in other countries is leading to ''narcodollar inflation, crime, violence, corruption and, in some cases, terrorism'' is all the more reason to legalize drug production in other countries.  Whether it is 20 million Americans or 120 million Americans who smoke marijuana, the point to remember is that attempts to prohibit an act that is harmful to the consumer is not the responsibility of government, particularly when that consumer chooses to engage in that activity fully informed.  If our Congressman and drug-enforcement agencies want to reduce crime, they would legalize marijuana.\n \nFRED MCKINNEY Waltham, Mass., Dec. 4, 1984"
