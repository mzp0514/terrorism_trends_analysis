    "full text": "It was with great amusement that I read your Sept. 1 editorial, ''A TV channel for all.'' Although I must confess I never quite got your point, which was something to do with expanded cable service (hundreds of stations!) and how the PLO, ''war lords,'' German skinheads and various other characters would get access to to their own channels.\nLamoin Werlein-Jaen, Madison ,\nAnyway, I thought I'd add a few suggestions to your list. We could begin with the ''Corrupt Politicians Channel'' dedicated to telling us how ''everything will get better.''\nNext we could pull together all the TV evangelists into a ''Perverted Ministers Channel'' so that they may pontificate about morality and the ''sanctity of life.''\nMoving along we would find Rush Limbaugh on the ''Right-wing Drivel Channel'' where we could also find the likes of Pat Buchanon. Finally, we could air all the Sunday news-talk shows on the ''Experts, Lies, and Videotape Channel'' where they would explain the difference between ''collateral damage'' and ''terrorism,'' the difference between ''armed gunmen'' and ''professional soldiers,'' between ''aggression'' and ''peace keeping,'' or the difference between the invasion of Panama and the invasion of Kuwait.\n\nLoad-Date: July 19, 1995"
