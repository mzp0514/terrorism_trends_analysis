The trust fund combines both these elements, therefore, robust AML/CFT regimes are an important pillars to strengthen the global financial framework.\nStating that financial stability and financial integrity are closely linked, he said money laundering and terrorist financing activities can undermine the soundness and stability of financial institutions and systems.\nThis can further discourage foreign investment, and distort international capital flows. Moreover, such problems can quickly spread to other countries in the region or in other parts of the world, he added.\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\nCopyright(c) 2009 RTTNews.com, Inc.
