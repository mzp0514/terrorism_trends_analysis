    "full text": "I have read with intense sympathy the ''expressions of abhorrence'' coming from ''eminent writers, philosophers and theologians'' on the shooting of the Pope: ''I don't understand. I just don't understand,'' is the universal tenor of all their statements (news article May 14).\nHarold Lockwood letter, in comment on assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II, offers suggestions to counteract acts of terrorism Pope John Paul IIv.hat I do not understand is that not a single one of these eminent people connected the ''general insanity,'' the ''world of senseless killing,'' the ''age of violence'' with the policy of nuclear war planned by the governments of great nations, atheistic and Christian alike.\nNuclear war means the rational planning for the murder of millions of men, women, children, animals and all organic life. It is the most barbaric expression of the spirit of our age, against which single acts of terrorism pale in significance.\nHere is the root of the contempt for life that sweeps the world. Is it not true, as it always was, that evil must be eradicated at the root? How shall we teach our children ''reverence for life'' while we are willing to kill all life in pursuit of political goals? And lest I be misunderstood: universal - not unilateral - nuclear disarmament is the answer.  EDWARD LOWINSKY\nChicago, May 14, 1981\n\nGraphic\n\n \nIllustrations: drawing of bullets"
