    "full text": "Profile of Youssef Samir Megahed, 23-year-old man who moved to Florida from Egypt with his family 11 years ago and who has legal residency in United States but is now in danger of being deported on accusations of possible terrorist activities; federal jury acquitted Megahed on charges of transporting explosives during road trip with friend who had packed model rocket propellants in trunk, but was. subsequently arrested again in connection with case by immigration authorities who are now holding him in Florida detention center; Megahed is at least third Florida defendant in three years to be brought up on immigration charges after prosecutors failed to win terrorism convictions in federal court; if convicted of new charges and deported, he will join thousands of other Muslim and Arab men sent home after 2001 as part of extensive law enforcement strategy that relies on. immigration courts to remove potential threats; some national security experts say country is safer without such men and immigration officials declare deportations both legal and fair; but with Pres Obama attempting to reach out to Muslim world, Megahed is being presented by critics of immigration strategy in US and abroad as test case of Obama's pledge to break with some of Bush administration's most unpopular policies; photo. \n\nGraphic\n\n \nPhotograph\n\nLoad-Date: June 5, 2009"
