The records also show they were physically and verbally abused by two Mexican smugglers with a history of crossing the border illegally and went days without food and water.\nThe case highlights the highly politicized nature of the U.S.-Mexico border as hysteria sometimes overtakes facts. Some blogs incorrectly reported the men were released. Others tied them to the Islamic State.\nAttorney: Gianforte spokesman lied about attack on reporter\nBILLINGS, Mont. - An attorney for a reporter assaulted by a Montana congressman on the eve of his election says the lawmaker's spokesman lied when he said \"no one was misled\" by the Republican's initial denial of responsibility.\nThe attorney for Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs sent a cease and desist letter on Monday telling U.S. Rep. Greg Gianforte and his staff to stop making \"false and defamatory statements\" about Jacobs.\nA law enforcement report released Nov. 17 revealed that Gianforte falsely told investigators that Jacobs had instigated the May 24 confrontation at his campaign office.\nSpokesman Travis Hall said in response to the report that \"no one was misled\" by Gianforte's initial statements to investigators.\nGianforte later apologized and pleaded guilty to criminal assault.
