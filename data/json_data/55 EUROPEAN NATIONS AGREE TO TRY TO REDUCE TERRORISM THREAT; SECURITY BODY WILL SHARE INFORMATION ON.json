    "full text": "Europe's top security body announced on Tuesday a counterterrorism plan aimed at eliminating illicit cash, weapons and safe havens for extremists. But it cautioned against trampling the rights of minorities.\nForeign ministers of the 55-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe closed a two-day conference on the terrorist threat with a plan to work more closely together against terrorism.\nBut the group warned against violating individual rights in the rush to detain suspects and bring to justice those who carry out attacks.\nThe group said it was determined \"to protect citizens from new challenges to their security, while at the same time safeguarding the rule of law, individual liberties, and the right to equal justice under the law.\"\nSecretary of State Colin Powell urged the leaders to starve terrorists of the cash they need to carry out operations like the terror attacks of Sept. 11 in the United States.\nPowell was in Bucharest on the first stop of a weeklong European visit. He offered \"significant resources\" to train other countries in how to cut the flow of cash to terrorists.\nThe European countries agreed to:\n* Share information on the whereabouts of terrorism suspects.\n* Tighten border controls and passport checks.\n* Work together to track how terrorist organizations are financed.\n* Crack down on organized crime, money laundering and illicit arms trafficking.\n* Redouble efforts to block inadvertent grants of refugee status or asylum to terrorists.\n\nNotes\n\nAMERICA RESPONDS\n\nLoad-Date: December 5, 2001"
