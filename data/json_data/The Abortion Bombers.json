    "full text": "On Feb. 28 the offices of Prince George's County, Md., Reproductive Services were destroyed by arson.\nOn July 4 in Washington D.C., a bomb attached to a gas stove destroyed part of the National Abortion Federation building.\nEditorial holds violent attacks on birth control and abortion facilities across US have become common new form of domestic terrorism; urges Reagan Amdinistration to condemn such actsThe police also found a pipe bomb that could have leveled the building.\nOn Sept. 13 in Atlanta, a bomb went off at the Northside Family Planning Clinic. A week later, another exploded at Planned Parenthood's Cobb City Clinic in nearby Marietta.\nLast week in Birmingham, Ala., a counselor at an abortion clinic whose staff had been harassed at work and at home found her house broken into and vandalized. Her cat had been decapitated.\nOn Monday in Wheaton, Md., a bomb destroyed an abortion clinic. Eleven minutes later and a mile away, another bomb destroyed a Planned Parenthood family planning center. There have been other bombs, arson, vandalism and burglaries at family planning clinics in Everett, Wash., St. Petersburg, Fla., and Houston - 24 violent incidents this year.\nSome of the clinics destroyed provided abortion services; some provided only contraceptive counseling. It's just a matter of luck that no one has yet been killed or injured, and chances are the luck won't last.\nThe attacks on birth control and abortion facilities are becoming a common new form of domestic terrorism. The Administration, quick to condemn terrorism elsewhere, has yet to speak out against violence aimed at American women and teen-agers. Doing so might not stay the impulses that seize warped minds. But decency, if not deterrence, is reason enough to denounce those who affirm life with bombs."
