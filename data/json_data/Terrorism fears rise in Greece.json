    "full text": "ATHENS, Greece (AP) - A rocket attack on a Citibank branch in Athens early Wednesday sent out much wider tremors: fears of a return of the deadly and elusive November 17 terrorist group.\n\"It's their way of saying, 'We're back, we haven't forgotten, so don't forget about us,'\" said Maria Bossi, former head of a committee formed to fight Greek terrorism.\nNo one claimed responsibility for the anti-tank missile attack, which caused extensive damage but no injuries.\nBut it carried all the hallmarks of November 17, which has been silent since the slaying of a Greek shipyard owner 11 months ago.\nNovember 17 is the only terrorist group in Greece known to use rockets. It often waits days before claiming responsibility for an attack.\nSome officials didn't wait for a declaration to put the blame on November 17, whose litany of violence and 22 killings dates to the 1975 murder of a CIA station chief.\n\"All the evidence points to November 17,\" said police subcommander Yiannis Giorgopoulos.\nPolice worry that Greece's oldest and most feared terrorist cell could begin a round of attacks. There was also concern about the target: a high-profile American company.\nU.S. firms in Athens, including car dealerships and McDonald's outlets, have been hit by a recent wave of bombings that have caused damage but no injuries. Those attacks were blamed on small leftist groups.\nThe rocket blast could mean November 17 is joining the mix at a time when Greece is under pressure from the United States to battle urban terrorists.\nNovember 17 is named for the day in 1973 when the-then ruling military junta crushed a student uprising in Athens.\n\nLoad-Date: April 9, 1998"
