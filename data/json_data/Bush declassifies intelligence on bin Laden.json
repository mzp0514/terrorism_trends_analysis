    "full text": "WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush, trying to defend his war strategy, declassified intelligence Tuesday asserting that Osama bin Laden ordered a top lieutenant in early 2005 to form a terrorist cell that would conduct attacks outside Iraq - and that the United States should be the top target. \nThe information mirrored a classified bulletin from the Homeland Security Department in March 2005, reporting that bin Laden had enlisted Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, his senior operative in Iraq, to plan potential strikes in the U.S. The warning was described at the time as credible but not specific and did not prompt the administration to raise its national terror alert level. \nThe declassification of the intelligence came a day before Bush was scheduled to speak about terrorism at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. \nBush, who has been battling Democrats in Congress over spending for the unpopular war in Iraq, will argue that the terrorist threat to America is real, said Frances Fragos Townsend, the White House homeland security adviser. She said Bush would talk about why Iraq is an important battleground in fighting terrorism abroad to prevent attacks on U.S. soil and highlight previously reported successes in foiling terrorist attacks. \nThe Bush White House has intermittently declassified and made public sensitive intelligence to help rebut critics or defend programs or actions against possibly adverse decisions in the Congress or the courts. \n\nLoad-Date: July 19, 2007"
