The novel's setting is a small town and its residents, who never would suspect terrorist activities in their backyard.\nAs the main characters uncover terrorist activities and pursue the members of the terrorist cell in this suspenseful, fast-paced novel, the author shares information about the threats of terrorism in the United States and the truth about Islam's use of terrorist activities.\nVon Freymann is a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point and the United States Army Ranger School and served as administrator of the U.S. Army Behavioral Sciences Research Laboratory.\nHe also has an understanding of the effort that goes into finding and neutralizing terrorist cells. Von Freymann is a self-made scholar of Islam and the Qur'an's influence on terrorist activities.\n\"I've researched the facts,\" he says, \"not [what] you hear from [people] who bang on Islam, and who haven't done their homework, yet make wild inflammatory statements with little or no basis, twist information or make it up.\"\nBecause of his background and research, von Freymann is able to go into the minds of terrorists to help people better understand the motivation behind terrorist acts.\nHe endeavors to show people how the Qur'an dictates the actions of Islamic terrorists and encourages the public to take this threat seriously Avalon Bay, A Jewelry Hunter Thriller.
