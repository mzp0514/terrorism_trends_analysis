Cohen has asked Congress for $ 49.2 million in next year's budget for training and equipment.\nNoting the threat posed by incidents such as the sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway or the terrorist bombing of the World Trade Center in New York, Cohen said the nation must be better prepared against potential chemical, biological or even nuclear catastrophe.\nThe new units will be given additional training and equipment, and National Guard and reserve forces could be deployed to handle reconnaissance and decontamination missions. A new office will oversee coordination of the units with existing ones, said officials at a Pentagon briefing.\nThe exact locations of the first 10 units will be chosen by May.\n\nLoad-Date: March 19, 1998"
