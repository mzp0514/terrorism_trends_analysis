Habibie.\nThe students seek Habibie's resignation and a trial for former President Suharto. Riots earlier  this year spurred by economic troubles and government corruption ousted Suharto after a 32-year  rule.  Milosevic rejects calls for probe\nBELGRADE, Yugoslavia - President Slobodan Milosevic turned down U.S. appeals Monday for access to  the ravaged province of Kosovo, but said he would consider an international probe into atrocities  there.\nJohn Shattuck, U.S. assistant secretary of state, and former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole met with  Milosevic following a weekend fact-finding tour of Kosovo. \"What we have seen is massive destruction  and horrendous human rights abuses on civilians,\" Shattuck said afterward.\nLocal residents say male citizens in recent weeks have gone missing after being taken into Serb  custody. During the Bosnian war, such occurrences resulted in allegations of genocide after mass  graves were located in areas where the men and boys went missing.\n\nNotes\n\nIN BRIEF NEWS OF THE WORLD\n\nLoad-Date: September 9, 1998"
