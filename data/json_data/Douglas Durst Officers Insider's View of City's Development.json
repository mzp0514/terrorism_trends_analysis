Founded in 1915 by his grandfather, Joseph, its signature buildings include 4 Times Square, the city's first environmentally friendly skyscraper. Mr. Durst, who\nis also chairman of New\nYork Water Taxi, spoke recently with The New York\nSun's .\nQ. As one of the city's largest developers, how do you see the rebuilding process going at the World Trade Center?\nA. Buildings are designed for tenants, and when the design was announced I thought it was premature without having identified any tenants yet for the buildings. It was uneconomical. The new design of the site, however, is more buildable than before. It is a good design.\nHow do you feel about the proposed Hudson Yards redevelopment, which includes the expansion of the Javits Center and the proposed Jets stadium?\nI am co-chair of the Friends of Hudson River Park and I have a number of questions on the proposed stadium. Most importantly, I would like to see funding for the park secured. Part of the original concept for funding Hudson River Park was that the proceeds from improvement in real estate development around the park would go to fund its completion. Obviously the extension of the no. 7 line is very important to improve the neighborhood, and the Javits Center is very important to the city. But any plan must include the completion of the park. We have expressed our views to the city and are in touch with the governor.\nSome critics have feared that with a sizable chunk of office space coming on line downtown, and the possible addition of more office space at the proposed Hudson Yards site, it will saturate the market. What is your opinion?\nWell, my father [Seymour Durst] was part of the opposition for developing the World Trade Center because he was against government getting into\nthe business of building\noffice spaces with a tax\nsubsidy. He was concerned\nthe WTC would overwhelm the market -\nwhich it did. There was space in the WTC that had never been rented as late as 1993. There is some concern that office space will saturate the market. The commercial market has been very weak over the past 2 1/2 years, and we are finally beginning to see some activity. Still, the construction won't start until 2010, which is a long way off, and I don't think the space will be built if there is not demand.\nYou have been actively working for better coverage for terrorism insurance for developers. How is that going?\nTerrorism insurance is a result of the lack of a policy by the Federal government to provide a service that is desperately needed. An act of terrorism is very remote, but the consequences are disastrous for insurance companies, and they are unable to properly calculate the risk or withstand the cost. The government provides flood insurance, and should follow the same course with terrorism insurance because it is a national problem.\nJust like floods, it happens more often in certain areas, but terrorism is not just an urban problem. It can happen where there are malls, or colleges. I believe the government should put a surcharge on all insurance to cover the cost for terrorism insurance. Instead, they have set it up as a federal loan to the insurance companies, which they have to pay back. This requires insurance companies to retain a great amount of reserves, which is expensive for them, and they may be forced to stop writing their terrorism policies.\nThe present mode of Congress, however, is not to start a new federal program, no matter how necessary.\nWould you be interested in constructing a building in the Hudson Yards neighborhood, and are there other areas of the city you are also looking at developing?\nWe mostly stay in Midtown Manhattan. My father had a saying: Only buy property we can walk to. We can walk to Hudson Yards, and would consider building there. But other areas of the city, such as Brooklyn, are too far. But what is fascinating about the city is that any area is now developable. Ten years ago you couldn't say that.\nThere were areas people simply wouldn't live in. This shows the vitality of New York City. After September 11, we lost about 200,000 jobs. At the same time, we had a surge in residential development. The one thing about constructing a building is that when you start, you can't stop when the market turns around. So a huge number of apartments came on line in 2001, but in spite of the large number of apartments and the loss of jobs, rents stayed relatively stable. And they have started to increase again.\n\nLoad-Date: June 28, 2004"
