    "full text": "Turkey opposes ending Iran ties\nTurkey's president has argued against severing economic ties with Iran as the United States readies for sanctions.\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan said it went against the independence of states to cut ties with its \"neighbor and strategic partner\" because the U.S. demanded it.\nPresident Donald Trump announced in May that he would pull out of a 2015 agreement over Iran's nuclear program and would re-impose sanctions. His administration threatened countries with sanctions if they don't cut off Iranian oil imports by early November.\nTurkey imported 3 million tons of crude oil from Iran in the first four months of 2018, amounting to 55 percent of crude supplies and 27 percent of its total energy imports.\nErdogan asked Wednesday: \"Who will heat my country throughout the winter?\"\nMexico, Canada united on NAFTA - Mexican and Canadian officials say talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement will remain a three-way negotiation, despite President Donald Trump's suggestion that he might pursue separate trade deals with both countries.\nMexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said, \"Canada and Mexico not only share geography, history and friendship, but also principles and common goals, and we are a team and act as a team.\"\nVisiting Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland also stressed that NAFTA was a three-country agreement. She said Canada also opposed a \"sunset\" clause proposed by Trump that would allow countries to opt out of the pact every five years.\nSpain's taxi drivers protest ride-hailing apps - Taxi drivers from all corners of Spain drove to Barcelona to join a 2-day strike that started Wednesday in protest of the growing number of cars operating under ride-hailing apps.\nThe taxi drivers, who joined a raucous protest in front of the Arch of Triumph, oppose the recent suspension of additional authorization required for ride-hailing companies to operate in Barcelona.\nThey want a previously agreed ratio of 30 taxi licenses for every authorized ride-hailing car to be honored. The current ratio in Catalonia, the Spanish region of which Barcelona is the capital, stands at about 6.7 to 1.\nAmerican pastor released from Turkish jail - An American pastor who had been jailed in Turkey for more than 1Â½ years on terrorism and espionage charges was released Wednesday and put under house arrest as his trial continues.\nAndrew Craig Brunson, 50, an evangelical pastor from Black Mountain, N.C., was let out of jail to serve home detention because of \"health problems,\" Turkey's official Anadolu news agency said.\nBrunson was arrested in December 2016. He has lived in Turkey for 23 years.\nIf convicted, he faces up to 15 years in prison for \"committing crimes on behalf of terror groups without being a member,\" references to outlawed Kurdish militants and the network of a U.S-based Muslim cleric blamed for a failed coup attempt. He could receive an additional 20 years if he is found guilty of espionage.\nTurkey passes anti-terrorism law - Turkey's parliament has passed an anti-terrorism law that gives authorities sweeping powers similar to ones during a 2-year state of emergency that ended last week.\nLegislation passed by lawmakers on Wednesday would allow mass purges of public employees for three more years and the holding of certain suspects for up to 12 days without charges.\nA state of emergency declared after a failed coup in July 2016 was allowed to expire last week. While it was in place, more than 77,000 people were arrested and some 130,000 civil servants sacked for alleged links to terrorist groups or to a U.S.-based cleric accused of masterminding the coup.\nThe new law also would authorize restricting open-air demonstrations to daylight hours.\nThe law needs the president's signature to be enacted.\n\nLoad-Date: July 30, 2018"
