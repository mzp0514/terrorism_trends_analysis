    "full text": "MOSCOW - The Foreign Ministry said Friday that Russia was selling Soviet submarines to Iran - despite an earlier denial and U.S. protests - but insisted the weapons deal would not destabilize the Middle East.  Foreign Ministry spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said that Russia would honor all commitments to sell weapons to Iran made by the former Soviet Union but that it would abide by international agreements concerning the sales.\nRussia confirmed to the United States that it planned to go ahead with the sale of diesel submarines to Iran, the State Department said Friday in Washington.  Last week, a Russian trade official said the sales, reportedly worth $750 million, had been suspended because of payment problems.  The acting U.S. secretary of state, Lawrence S. Eagleburger, complained earlier to Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev about the sales, saying Russia ''has a certain relationship to terrorism that we consider to be anathema.'' Eagleburger argued that Iran sponsored terrorism and that providing it with modern weapons could destabilize the Persian Gulf.  But Yastrzhembsky said Friday that Russia must honor contracts made by the former Soviet Union.  ''We believe that our arms transfers to Iran are balanced and do not upset stability in the region,'' he said. ''Overall, we do not make any supplies that could be used for purposes other than to protect the receiving country.'' The Federal News Service agency, based in Moscow, quoted an unidentified source at Russia's Naval General Staff as saying that Russia had already sold one diesel-powered submarine to Iran and that it would sell a total of three.  The first sub is reportedly steaming toward Iran with a mixed Russian-Iranian crew.\n\nLoad-Date: October 12, 1993"
