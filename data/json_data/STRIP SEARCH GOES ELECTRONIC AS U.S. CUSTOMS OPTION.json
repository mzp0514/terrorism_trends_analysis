    "full text": "With airports bracing for Y2K problems and possible terrorism, the U.S. Customs Service has begun using new hightech scanners that can see through passengers' clothing and search for contraband with an X-ray image that shows the naked body.\nInternational travelers who are suspected of smuggling drugs or carrying weapons are being offered the body scanner as an alternative to a physical pat-down or frisk when they pass through ports of entry at airports across the country.\nThe scanner can display hidden guns, knives, batteries, digital watches, explosive materials and packages of drugs concealed under clothing. Supporters say scanners can help in the fight against terrorism and illegal drug importation.\nBut privacy advocates say the technology's capability to show the full external contours of the body, including male and female private areas, is an \"electronic strip search\" that erodes constitutional protections and is more invasive than a frisk, which is performed while a suspect is fully clothed.\nCustoms Commissioner Raymond Kelly says the body scanners give travelers the choice of avoiding the physical contact of an external body search at the hands of an inspector.\n\"The option is that we can pat you physically,\" he said, \"or you can step in front of this machine. You don't have to do it.\"\n\nLoad-Date: December 30, 1999"
