The discussion will be moderated by Business Insurance Senior Editor Mark A. Hofmann.\nThese experts will discuss the challenges of winning congressional approval for TRIA, what impact Hurricane Katrina will have on reauthorization efforts, why they believe TRIA is vital to U.S. businesses and the insurance industry, and how businesses and insurers should plan for the possibility that the act will not be extended, resulting in a loss of a federal backstop of insurance coverage for future terrorism risks.\nAnyone concerned with the TRIA reauthorization efforts should attend, including risk managers, brokers, insurers, reinsurers, regulators and industry association executives.\nRegister today to attend this free online panel discussion by visiting: www.businessinsurance.com/webinars.\nRegistered attendees of the live event will have the opportunity to ask questions of the panelists. In case you are unable to attend the live event, an archived version of the live webinar will be available afterward at the above URL.\n\nLoad-Date: September 30, 2005"
