In fact, the FBI just released a heavily redacted memo that details some of the ways that it used its anti-terrorism surveillance power to keep last year's OWS campaign heavily guarded.Released by the Partnership for Civil Justice after it pursued the documents under the Freedom of Information Act, the items included will just serve to (depending on your worldview) reinforce your paranoia American security bureaus having the carte blanche to become Big Brother, or terrify you into validating the belief that those kids with the drums and the dreadlocks were planning another 9/11.\n -As early as August 19, 2011, the FBI in New York was meeting with the New York Stock Exchange to discuss the Occupy Wall Street protests that wouldn't start for another month.

Such messages shall not be released in either written or oral form to the media, the general public or other personnel...\" (The DSAC document was also obtained by the Northern California ACLU which has sought local FBI surveillance files.)\nTranslation: You want to know how Citibank had the drop on protesters last October? They were tipped off by the FBI/Department of Homeland Security and/or the Domestic Security Alliance Council.\n -The Memphis FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force met to discuss \"domestic terrorism\" threats, including, \"Aryan Nations, Occupy Wall Street, and Anonymous.\"\nTranslation: One of these things is not like the other...\nTo read the entirety of the document, click here.
