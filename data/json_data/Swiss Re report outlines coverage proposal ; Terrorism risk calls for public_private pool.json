Typically, in the United States a levy of 3% to 5% of property premium would be appropriate, Swiss Re suggests.\n* A greater sharing of the loss burden by further aligning the interests of all parties-policyholders, insurers, reinsurers and government.\nIn addition, policyholders should carry a ''significant'' deductible of around 5% to 10% of insured values.\nInsured losses would be pooled, and the pool reinsured beyond a given deductible by reinsurers, capital markets and governments, with the governments being the insurers of last resort. Such an approach would mean ''all stakeholders bear a portion of the risk relative to their financial capacity,'' Swiss Re said.\nA copy of the report is available at www.swissre.com. \n\nLoad-Date: March 1, 2002"
