    "full text": "The editorial ''Peace for Terror,'' Aug. 17, bears rereading and\nreprinting: The Israeli government has been launching offensive and\nillegal raids into Lebanon while citing Arafat for ''terrorism.''\nIsrael justifies this, with the support of the US government, in\nterms of ''security.''\nYet Israeli attacks into Lebanon and the\ncontinued oppression of Palestinians in Israel and the occupied\nterritories only makes for more enemies. The longtime Israeli\npolicy of getting rid of Palestinian Arabs or breaking their spirit\nis no longer viable.\n''Transferring'' to other countries is not realistic, and\ninternal oppression will lead only to frustration and violence. For\nits own security Israel needs to rethink its policy. Unfortunately,\nyour conclusion, ''Real peace in the Middle East can't be made at\nthe expense of one party. The United States must end its silence,''\noffers little hope. Only if Israel and our government take an\nhonest look at Israel's ''security'' needs will there be peace in\nthe Middle East.\nBernice L. Youtz, Olympia, Washington\n \n Your letters are welcome.
