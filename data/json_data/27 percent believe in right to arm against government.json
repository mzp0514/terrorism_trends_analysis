    "full text": "Twenty-seven percent of Americans believe citizens have the right to arm themselves and organize to oppose the powers of the federal government, according to a Time Magazine/CNN poll released yesterday.\nSeventy percent disagreed with that notion, and 3 percent were unsure.\nThe telephone survey of 600 Americans conducted on Thursday found that 52 percent of those polled agreed the government ''has become so large and powerful it poses a threat to the rights and freedoms of ordinary citizens.''\nForty-four percent disagreed with that notion, while 4 percent were unsure.\nThe poll also found that 84 percent approve of President Clinton's handling of the Oklahoma City bombing, and 60 percent said they approve of how he is handling his job as president, the highest approval rating Clinton has ever achieved in a TIME/CNN poll.\nThe poll, which came after the arrest of Timothy McVeigh for the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building, asked respondents whether ''international terrorism'' or ''terrorism committed by American citizens'' was the greater problem.\nSome 53 percent said ''domestic terrorism'' is the greater problem compared with 25 percent who believed ''international terrorism'' is the greater threat. Fifteen percent felt both were an equal threat, and 7 percent were not sure.\nThe poll, which had a sampling error of plus or minus 4 percent, found 86 percent believe it likely than an act of terrorism will occur in the United States in the next 12 months.\nIn the wake of the Oklahoma bombing, 36 percent of poll respondents said they now have worries about being in public places.\nEighty percent of those polled said they see militia groups as dangerous, but only 36 percent feel the federal government should force them to disband.\n\nLoad-Date: May 18, 1995"
