Bush's daughters, even when they were in trouble for underage drinking.\nBut Malia only asked her father a question, and you attacked her like she committed the crime of the century. You are a racist and no one can change your attitude, but when you attack a child, you're the most dangerous person on this earth. You have so much hatred in your heart for the first family.\nLora Neal\nPhiladelphiaThe real Islam Re the article about the Big Apple Bus ad:\nIslam is a religion of peace, freedom, equality, justice, righteousness and true faith. Islam commands us to uphold good and forbid evil. It's sad that a person who criticizes Islam doesn't have any knowledge about the religion, yet they view it as a cause of terrorism.\nA woman in Islam has more rights than men do. One of the rights that women have over the men is that they are provided with everything they need to maintain the household, and, as men, we are obligated to provide this maintenance.\nIslam gave women the choice to use things that men could not. Islam protects men and women, and thus any guidelines directed at one necessarily benefits both.\nA woman's feminine nature is recognized without allowing the society to exploit her. Islam allows her the things that suit her nature and, at the same time, cautions her against anything that might abuse or upset that nature. \nIslam doesn't support terrorism.\nWe support peace and submission and dignify humanity. \nMalik Gilmore\nCurran-Fromhold\nCorrectional Facility\nPhiladelphia\n\nLoad-Date: June 11, 2010"
