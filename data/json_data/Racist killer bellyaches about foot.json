He freaked the f-k out and started screaming. He scared the hell out of me,\" Jackson said in his videotaped confession. \"So I stabbed him a couple more times in the chest.\"\nHe later told detectives he hated mixed-race couples, though Caughman was alone when Jackson murdered him.\n\nLoad-Date: December 22, 2018"
