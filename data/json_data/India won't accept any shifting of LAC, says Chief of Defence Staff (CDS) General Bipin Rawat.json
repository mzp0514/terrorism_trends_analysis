He said situation at LAC was tense and Chinese people's Liberation Army was facing unexpected results due to the strong response of Indian forces in Ladakh to their audacity.\n\"In the overall security calculus, border confrontation, transgressions and unprovoked tactical military actions spiralling into a larger conflict cannot be discounted,\" Rawat said speaking at the diamond jubilee celebrations of the National Defence College .\nHe also spoke about the cross-border terrorism from Pakistan and how Indian forces dealt with it ,\"The relation between Indian and Pakistan have worsened due to Pakistan's persistent proxy war in Jammu and Kashmir and wicked rhetoric against India.\"\nDefence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said that India was determined to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of unilateralism and aggression, no matter what the sacrifice.\nThe Minister said, peace could only be guaranteed by preventing war.\n\"Perhaps the most fundamental lesson that the roller coaster of the rise and fall of nations taught us was that peace cannot necessarily be achieved by a desire for peace but by the ability to deter war. Unfortunately, the mere desire to seek peace, if not reciprocated by others, does not necessarily succeed in building a harmonious environment in a world beset by conflicting ideas of security, sovereignty and national interests,\" Singh added.\n\nLoad-Date: November 7, 2020"
