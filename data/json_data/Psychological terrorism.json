    "full text": "The degree to which psychological terrorism is being perpetrated upon the world has never been seen before. The depth and breadth of this plan is a feat that could not have been devised by man alone. For those with eyes to see, it's a prophetic warning. \nIt's always been that those who control information control the masses, but never have we seen such bald-faced, relentless propaganda, disinformation, censorship and obfuscation ... otherwise known as lies and corruption. Our news media, politicians and officials have not only lost complete credibility, they have sunk to a level of depravity. America is now in a very dark place. \nUnfortunately, many are unaware or unconcerned with this horrendous fraud. As our Orwellian dystopia nears completion, they seem content with a boot stamping on their face forever, so long as they're provided with unlimited junk food, mindless television, and sports, social media, drugs, alcohol and entitlements. \nI'm sure if the serpent fooled Adam and Eve while they lived in their perfect Garden of Eden, then it's nothing for him to deceive those who have turned their backs on the truth to wallow in a decadent culture. And the coming great reset will be the greatest deception of all. \nOnly the father of lies could be behind such a master plan, and I don't mean the editor of The New York Times, although he may be a relation. But soon the truth will be known since \"there is nothing hidden that won't be revealed.\" \nSteven Crichley \nSouth Side \n\nLoad-Date: December 2, 2020"
