    "full text": "Global death tolls from Islamic terrorism are an inexact science because of definitional questions. But on a month-to-month basis, no one can be too happy with the bloody results of August 2003. A bomb in Russia on August 2 killed 35. A bomb in Jakarta on August 6 killed at least 15.An August 8 attack on the Jordanian embassy in Baghdad killed 11. Bombs at United Nations headquarters in Baghdad and on a bus in Jerusalem killed about 40 people on August 20. An August 26 bombing in Bombay killed 52. And on August 29 an attack on a Shiite shrine at Najaf, Iraq, killed between 85 and 125 people. That's a total of about 250 terrorism deaths, just in the big attacks in one month. Since the State Department's total terrorism death count for 2002 was 725, August's figures mean that last month, terrorism was actually getting worse.\nDemocrats will no doubt rush to use these figures to claim that President Bush and the Republican-controlled Congress are losing the war on terrorism. But the alternatives that the Democrats have generally supported - less military spending; more coddling of soft-on-terror European nations like France; hesitancy in using military force against the terror sponsors; a reliance on the United Nations; negotiations with terror regimes - offer less promise of victory than the Republican hard line. President Bush said in May aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln, \"The war on terror is not over; yet it is not endless. We do not know the day of final victory, but we have seen the turning of the tide...Free nations will press on to victory.\" The deaths of August throw open to question Mr. Bush's claim that the tide has turned. Yet they confirm his assertion that the war on terror is not over. And they remind us all of the need for Mr. Bush to hold firm in his vow to press on to victory.\n\nLoad-Date: September 4, 2003"
