Nidal Hasan, an American-born Muslim who officials believe was inspired by a radical Islamic cleric, faces the death penalty if convicted of 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder in the attack.\nWhile several government reports have described the rampage as an act of terrorism, soldiers and their relatives say the only way Fort Hood victims and their families will get the same benefits as troops killed or injured in combat is if the defense secretary specifically designates the shooting a \"terrorist attack.\"\nPentagon press secretary George Little said Friday that the Department of Defense \"will not, at this time, further characterize\" the shooting because it is committed to the integrity of the ongoing court-martial proceedings against Hasan. There are concerns that formally changing the designation could affect the legal proceedings.\nAn October 2011 letter on behalf of Defense Secretary Leon Panetta was sent to U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, saying \"the department is dealing with the threat of violent Islamist extremism in the context of a broader threat of workplace violence.\"\n- The Associated Press\n\nLoad-Date: October 22, 2012"
