    "full text": "Efforts by state attorneys to defend a new commercial terrorism law failed Wednesday, when a federal judge sided with opponents who claimed the restrictions on picketing and public demonstrations were unconstitutional.\nThe Utah Animal Rights Coalition, aided by the American Civil Liberties Union [ACLU], sued the state over the law, which had been passed by the Utah Legislature earlier this year.\nIt prohibited picketers from emitting light rays or sound waves that might enter a business.\nThe plaintiffs earlier won a preliminary injunction, which halted it from going into effect on May 1.\nAfter hearing arguments Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Bruce Jenkins ruled the law was unconstitutional.\nThe biggest flaw with the law, Jenkins said, was that it was overly broad and vague.\nIt did not specifically define what level of noise or light would violate the law.\nThose restrictions, the ACLU and its allies successfully argued, violated the First Amendment right of free speech because they could have potentially criminalized behavior by any protestors who spoke or held signs in front of a business.\nSean Diener, executive director of Utah's Animal Rights Coalition, said that the now-defunct law had hindered his group's recruiting efforts because many prospects feared they would be arrested, even for peaceful protests. Now, however, he expects the group to return to business as usual.\nSaid Diener: \"It will be really effective in creating confidence for demonstrations during the Olympics.\"\n\nLoad-Date: October 11, 2001"
