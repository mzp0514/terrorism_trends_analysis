    "full text": "The Clinton administration issued a public warning to Pakistan today that it could be branded a state sponsor of terrorism -- ending any hope for a resumption of large-scale American aid -- if the Pakistani Army continued to support terrorists blamed for the hijacking of an Indian Airlines jet last month.\nThe administration also denounced the decision by Pakistan's new leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, to require all higher court judges to swear an oath that would bar them from challenging the army. The country's chief justice refused to take the pledge earlier this week and was immediately replaced.\nThe State Department's chief spokesman, James P. Rubin, said that a possible connection between Pakistan's military and the group tied to the hijacking, Harkat ul-Mujahedeen, \"is a matter of extreme concern to us -- this is an organization that we have declared a terrorist organization.\"\nAsked at a news conference to explain the implications of a link, Mr. Rubin said that \"if the secretary of state determines that a government has repeatedly provided support of international terrorism directly, then she would be prepared to designate that country as a state sponsor of terrorism.\"\n\"Any country in the world should know that if we determine that they have provided support to international terrorism on a repeated basis, that they are subject to this designation,\" he continued.\nThe remarks make official what senior administration officials have been saying privately -- that Pakistan's ties to the terrorists threaten the already turbulent relationship with the United States, once a close ally, and could produce new American sanctions. General Musharraf took power in a coup last October.\nIn a meeting last week in Pakistan with a delegation of senior Clinton administration officials, General Musharraf refused their request that he ban Harkat ul-Mujahedeen, a radical group seeking independence for Muslims in the disputed territory of Kashmir, officials said.\nA decision by the United States to add Pakistan to its official list of nations that support terrorism -- a list that includes Iran, Iraq and Syria -- would end any lingering hope in Pakistan for the resumption of what had once been a large package of American aid.\nThe package, which totalled hundreds of millions of dollars a year in the late 1980's, was cut off in 1990 as a result of fears over a Pakistan program to develop nuclear weapons. Washington now provides Pakistan with only about $6 million in aid each year -- half of it for counternarcotics assistance, half for health programs for women and children.\nAdministration officials have also said that the United States could use its leverage in the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to cut off loans to Pakistan, although they said the administration would be reluctant to take any move that might push already impoverished Pakistan into near collapse.\nAmerican officials said that without some quick move by Pakistan to clamp down on the terrorists or to push for reform, President Clinton will bypass Pakistan during a trip to the region at the end of March that is scheduled to include India and Bangladesh. It will be the first presidential trip to the Indian subcontinent in more than two decades.      \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: January 28, 2000"
