    "full text": "Noxious fumes that forced the evacuation of NorthTown Mall in February are being investigated as a possible domestic terrorist incident.\n The case was forwarded to the FBI's Inland Northwest Joint Terrorism Task Force  because detectives believed they had credible information that made it more than just a disruption of service, said Spokane police spokeswoman Officer Jennifer DeRuwe. Officials wouldn't say specifically what led them to that conclusion.\n Norman C. Brown, the federal task force supervisor, said police agencies pass along tips about once a month, but rarely forward cases like the NorthTown incident.\n The task force receives cases when authorities believe there might be a connection to terrorism, Brown said. \"With respect to the NorthTown Mall, it was forwarded to us for that very reason.\"\n NorthTown Mall shoppers were evacuated Feb. 11 after some suffered symptoms consistent with being exposed to pepper spray or Mace, DeRuwe said. Reactions included coughing, watery eyes and noses, and scratchy throats.\n At least 36 people sought medical treatment but no one suffered long-term effects, DeRuwe said.\n Brown said the incident \"could be anything from a prank to an intentional act against a targeted store.\"Another objective may have been to test  the emergency-response system, Brown said. \"If these individuals were sophisticated, it would give them an idea of the type of response and a time frame in which they can operate safely.\"\n Testing the emergency-response system or trying to impact a store's business are considered possible terrorist acts, officials said.\n More than 24 firefighters, 20 police officers and at least five ambulances responded, police officials said.\n \"Whenever an incident occurs that involves an unknown substance, we respond by mobilizing all resources in the interest of the public's safety,\" DeRuwe said. \"We can always downgrade later. There may be criticism that we overreacted. But the public is our No. 1 concern.\"\n A surveillance video showed a man running from JC Penney inside the mall, where the incident was centered, DeRuwe said. However, police did not receive any tips regarding the man's identity before forwarding the case to the terrorism task force, and it's unknown if he was involved.\n Brown said Friday: \"We have no suspects at this time, but we do have some fair leads.\"\n The Inland Northwest Joint Terrorism Task Force is made up of federal, state and local law enforcement, and funded through the FBI's budget. \"National FBI officials couldn't recall an incident like the NorthTown evacuation being terrorist-related.\n Domestic terrorists are U.S. residents \"who commit acts of terrorism on our own soil, such as members affiliated with the Animal Liberation Front or the Earth Liberation Front,\" Brown said. Other groups that have been associated with terrorist acts include militias, Aryan Nations and Constitutionalists.\n The FBI defines domestic terrorism as force or violence that's intended \"to intimidate or coerce a government or civilian population in furtherance of political or social views.\"\n When two Hummers were damaged in 2005 at the George Gee Auto Dealership in Liberty Lake, the joint terrorism task force determined it was domestic terrorism. The case is different  from the NorthTown Mall incident because \"an individual claiming to be affiliated with the Environmental Liberation Front claimed responsibility,\" Brown said. An investigation is ongoing.\n The FBI Inland Northwest did not have a joint terrorism task force before 2002. \"Now we have personnel to devote toward terrorism incidents,\" Brown said. \"And as a direct result of Sept. 11, law enforcement is more than willing to forward these types of incidents to terrorism task forces.\"\n\nLoad-Date: July 4, 2007"
