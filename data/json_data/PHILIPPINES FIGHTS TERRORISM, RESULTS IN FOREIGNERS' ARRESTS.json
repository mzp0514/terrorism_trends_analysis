    "full text": "Police said Monday they have arrested another man they believe was an accomplice in plots to blow up U.S. airliners and assassinate Pope John Paul II during his visit to the Philippines last year.\nAuthorities have blamed the plots on Ramzi Yousef, now being held in New York on charges of masterminding the 1993 World Trade Center bombing that killed six people and injured 1,000.  \nPolice arrested six foreigners Friday. On Monday, they announced that Yousef's girlfriend identified one of the suspects - Mohammad Anees - as a key figure in plots to kill the pope and to blow up United Airlines jets over the Pacific.\nPolice said Anees carried a Pakistani passport. He and the five others were arrested when police found them in a car carrying plastic bombs, bomb-making materials and various travel documents. Using an alias, Anees came to the Philippines in late 1994 to prepare for the pope's visit to Manila on Jan. 12-16 last year, a police report said.\nAnees is among at least 27 foreigners, many of them Arabs, arrested since military, police and immigration agents launched a crackdown on suspected terrorists last month. Among those arrested was Adel Anonn, believed to be Yousef's brother. Anonn denied being Yousef's brother and denied being a terrorist.\nYousef was apprehended in March in Pakistan and deported to the United States. He is awaiting trial in New York in the February 1993 bombing.\nPhilippine authorities also have charged Yousef with murder in the December bombing of a Philippine Airlines jet.\n\nLoad-Date: January 3, 1996"
