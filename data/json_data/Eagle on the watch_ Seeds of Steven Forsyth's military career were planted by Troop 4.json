However, the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, changed his mind, and he volunteered for the infantry instead. After graduating in June 2002, he went through officer training and U.S. Army Ranger training, then led a platoon during the initial phase of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nHe earned a Bronze Star for planning and leading more than 200 combat patrols, resulting in the destruction or capture of multiple local insurgent cells.\nForsyth then was selected to command a new army company, building it from the ground up, and then served on a military advisory team. He then got out of the army and took a job doing contract work for the Department of Defense, holding that job for two years before joining the DIA.\nMeanwhile, Forsyth is also a student at Georgetown University, pursuing his master's degree in security studies, terrorism and sub-state violence.\nAs an operations officer with the DIA, Forsyth said he enjoys the ever-changing dynamics of his job, and he's confident in this nation's ability to protect itself against terrorism.\n\"I'm fairly confident we can get most of the bigger threats with the resources we have,\" he said. \"The more advanced aspects of our government are very good at what they do -- I've seen it firsthand.\"\nAmos, Forsyth's former scout leader, says that kind of enthusiasm and confidence should give a level of assurance to the American people.\n\"Steven really believes in what he's doing,\" Amos said, \"and that's one of the things that makes me sleep a little better at night.\"\njtomlin@hpe.com -- 888-3579\nTo see more of the High Point Enterprise, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.hpe.com.
