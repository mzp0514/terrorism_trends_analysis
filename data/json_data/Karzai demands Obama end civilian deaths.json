President Hamid Karzai said airstrikes cannot win the fight against terrorism. \"Our demand is that there will be no civilian casualties in Afghanistan. We cannot win the fight against terrorism with airstrikes,\" Karzai said. \"This is my first demand of the new president of the United States - to put an end to civilian casualties.\" Karzai spoke about the deaths at a news conference held to congratulate Obama on his election victory. Obama has talked about the issue of civilian deaths in the past. In remarks in August that drew criticism from Republicans, he said: \"We've got to get the job done there and that requires us to have enough troops so that we're not just air-raiding villages and killing civilians, which is causing enormous problems there.\" The U.S. military said it was investigating the deaths from bombing of remote Wech Baghtu in the southern province of Kandahar. A villager said American forces had given them permission to bury the dead, which he said included 23 children and 10 women.\n\nLoad-Date: November 6, 2008"
