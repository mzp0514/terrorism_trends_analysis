Pervez Musharraf said Pakistan and Afghanistan face a great danger from fringe groups that preach hate and radicalism. He also admitted that Taliban fighters seek safe haven in Pakistan before crossing the border to launch attacks. \nIn eastern Nangarhar province, which borders Pakistan, a roadside bomb blast killed three U.S. troops Sunday, the governor's spokesman said, bringing to six the number of international forces killed over the weekend. \nThe tribal meeting's closing statement said that a 50-man team of prominent leaders from both countries would hold regular meetings and work to \"expedite the ongoing process of dialogue for peace and reconciliation with the opposition,\" a reference to Taliban militants. \nMusharraf, after landing back in Pakistan, said the committee should \"engage warring forces in Afghanistan to bring the terrorism and extremism to an end.\" Afghan President Hamid Karzai in the past has also encouraged dialogue with Taliban fighters to persuade them to support the government. \nThe White House has been working to broker what in the past has been a very public dispute between the Karzai and Musharraf, two of its close allies. The idea for the meeting, or jirga, came nearly a year ago during a meeting involving President Bush, Musharraf and Karzai.\n\nLoad-Date: August 13, 2007"
