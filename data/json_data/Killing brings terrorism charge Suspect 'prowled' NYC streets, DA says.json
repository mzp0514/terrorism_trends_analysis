    "full text": "A sword-wielding racist who traveled to New York City and allegedly killed a homeless black man was charged Monday with state terrorism charges -- a rarity -- in a crime that prosecutors decried as an assault on personal and racial freedom.\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office filed first- and second-degree murder as an act of terrorism charges against James Jackson, 28. Terrorism charges are typically filed at the federal level and are reserved for suspects who planned mass attacks, anti-abortion killings or eco-terrorism. Among the most famous domestic terror cases are the Unabomber attacks, the Oklahoma City bombing and the Charleston church shooting.\nJackson was originally charged with run-of-the-mill murder charges, but prosecutors upgraded the ante to terrorism Monday. He was depicted in an indictment as an assassin who traveled from his Baltimore home for one simple reason: the scouting and killing of a black person on the streets of New York.\n\"James Jackson prowled the streets of New York for three days in search of a black person to assassinate in order to launch a campaign of terrorism against our Manhattan community and the values we celebrate,\" District Attorney Cyrus Vance wrote in announcing the charges, which  include a count of murder in the second degree as a hate crime.\nStabbed in the attack March 20  was Timothy Caughman. \n\nGraphic\n\n \nphoto AP\n\nLoad-Date: March 28, 2017"
