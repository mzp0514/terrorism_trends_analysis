The Irish government said yesterday it recognized the need for security forces ''to take all reasonable measures to combat terrorism.'' But it said that the government ''was gravely perturbed that three unarmed Irish people should have been shot dead â€¦ when it appears they could have been arrested by the security forces involved.''\n''I'm afraid (the incident) will give rise to a further surge of feeling that they're shooting first and asking questions later,'' said a senior Irish official in London. But, the official said, there is also great relief that the British have prevented another major bombing.\nThe incident took place on Sunday when three unarmed members of the IRA were shot as they were about to return to Spain from Gibraltar.\nThe two men and one woman were known IRA veterans who had been tracked by British and Spanish police for several weeks. They were quickly identified by an IRA spokesman in Belfast as members of a ''service unit'' who died ''in active service.''\nEyewitnesses reported that the three were killed by young men dressed in casual clothes who suddenly began shooting at close range without challenging the terrorists, according to the Independent newspaper. The British press has speculated they were killed by members of an covert antiterrorist unit of the British military known as the Special Air Service Regiment or SAS.\nBritish foreign secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe told Parliament Monday that the car left behind by the group before the shooting contained no bomb but Spanish police later found a car rented in the name of one of the terrorists which contained bomb-making equipment. In a protest over the killings, the Irish Republican Army staged a series of fire bomb attacks in Belfast on Monday night. No injuries were reported."
