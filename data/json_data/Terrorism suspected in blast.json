    "full text": "BERLIN - The German government said yesterday that it believed a truck explosion at a synagogue in Tunisia that killed 14 people, including eight Germans, was a deliberate attack and not an accident as first reports suggested.\nInterior Minister Otto Schily said that, based on the latest information it and the Tunisian government had obtained, it appeared the blast on the resort island of Djerba had been planned.\nA bus carrying a party of German tourists took much of the force of the explosion.\n\"The latest information and indications we have been getting from both inside the country and outside have pointed increasingly toward an attack,\" Schily said in a television interview last night.\nSchily said German federal police were working on the case in Tunisia. He denied a suggestion that the Tunisian government was sticking to an initial theory that the explosion of the gasoline tanker was accidental.\nIsrael has already said it suspects the blast outside the El Ghriba Jewish shrine on Djerba was a terrorist attack.\nBesides the eight Germans, the blast killed a Frenchman, a Tunisian tour guide, a policeman, two Tunisians working at the synagogue, and the driver of the truck, officials said.\nAbout one million German tourists travel to Tunisia for holidays each year.\nA German Embassy spokeswoman said 19 injured Germans had been flown home. Ten seriously injured Germans arrived on a German air force hospital plane late yesterday in Hamburg.\nThe main damage to the ornate synagogue occurred at its entrance, where a painted ceiling was entirely charred and the stained-glass windowpanes blown out.\n\nLoad-Date: April 15, 2002"
