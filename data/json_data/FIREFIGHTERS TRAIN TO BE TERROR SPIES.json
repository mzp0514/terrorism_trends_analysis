The government monitors phone calls and e-mails; people who fly have their belongings searched before boarding and are limited in what they can carry; and some people have trouble traveling because their names are similar to those on terrorist watch lists.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union says using firefighters to gather intelligence is another step in that direction. Mike German, a former FBI agent who is now national security policy counsel to the ACLU, said the concept is dangerously close to the Bush administration's 2002 proposal to have workers with access to private homes - such as postal carriers and telephone repairmen - report suspicious behavior to the FBI.\n\"Americans universally abhorred that idea,\" German said.\nThe Homeland Security Department is testing a program with the New York City fire department to share intelligence information so firefighters are better prepared when they respond to emergency calls. Homeland Security also trains the New York City fire service in how to identify material or behavior that may indicate terrorist activities. If it's successful, the government intends to expand the program to other major metropolitan areas.\nAs part of the program, which started last December, Homeland Security gave secret clearances to nine New York fire chiefs, according to reports obtained by The Associated Press.\n\"They're really doing technical inspections, and if perchance they find something like, you know, a bunch of RPG (rocket-propelled grenade) rounds in somebody's basement, I think it's a no-brainer,\" said Jack Tomarchio, a senior official in Homeland Security's intelligence division. \"The police ought to know about that; the fire service ought to know about that; and potentially maybe somebody in the intelligence community should know about that.\"\nEven before the federal program began, New York firefighters and inspectors had been training to recognize materials and behavior the government identifies as \"signs of planning and support for terrorism.\"\nWhen going to private residences, for example, they are told to be alert for a person who is hostile, uncooperative or expressing hate or discontent with the United States; unusual chemicals or other materials that seem out of place; ammunition, firearms or weapons boxes; surveillance equipment; still and video cameras; night-vision goggles; maps, photos, blueprints; police manuals, training manuals, flight manuals; and little or no furniture other than a bed or mattress.\nThe trial program with Homeland Security opens a clear information-sharing channel - which did not exist before - between the fire service and Homeland Security's intelligence division.\n\"We're there to help people, and by discovering these type of events, we're helping people,\" said New York City Fire Chief Salvatore Cassano. \"There are many things that firefighters do that other law enforcement or other agents aren't able to do.\" He added, \"A normal person that doesn't have this training wouldn't be looking for it.\"\nCassano would not discuss specifics, but he did say that some terrorism-related information has been passed along to law enforcement since firefighters and officers began the training three years ago. \"They've had some hits,\" Cassano said. \"It's working.\"\nSeparately, the fire services in Washington, D.C., Phoenix and Atlanta have also been receiving terrorism-related intelligence training. Los Angeles County provides intelligence training so firefighters and inspectors can spot dangerous chemicals or other materials that could be used in bombs. And the fire service is also represented in at least 13 state and regional intelligence \"fusion\" centers across the country - where local, state and federal agencies share information about terrorism and other crimes.\nIn Washington, the fire service made its first foray into the intelligence world about two years ago, and now D.C. Fire/EMS has access to the same terrorism-related intelligence as the police, said Larry Schultz, an assistant fire chief in charge of operations.\n'We see things'\nD.C. firefighters and EMS providers are in 170,000 homes and businesses each year on routine calls, Schultz said.\n\"So we see things and observe things that may be useful to law enforcement,\" he said. \"We can walk into your house. We don't need a search warrant.\" If an ambulance team shows up at a house and sees detailed maps of the District's public transit system on the wall, that's something the EMS provider would pass along, he said.\n\"It's the evolution of the fire service,\" said Bob Khan, the fire chief in Phoenix, which has created an information-sharing arrangement between the fire service and law enforcement through terrorism liaison officers.\nBecause firefighters are on the front lines, the fire service needs to know about intelligence that could somehow affect what they do, said Gregory Cade, who as head of the U.S. Fire Administration is the nation's top fire chief.\nIf, for example, Washington is hosting an International Monetary Fund meeting where there will be a large group of protesters and a truckload of gasoline has been stolen in Baltimore, firefighters need to know about intelligence from overseas that terrorists are trying to make explosive devices out of gasoline, Schultz said.\n\"Getting appropriate, actionable intelligence is important for a fire chief in deciding what to do and how to allocate resources and to know what's going on,\" Cade said. \"No one is expecting us to be the analyst person who is sitting down, trying to connect all of this stuff together and determining, 'Oh, yes, this looks like a terrorist plot.' \"\n\nGraphic\n\n \nLarry McCormack/The Tennessean/AP Nashville, Tenn., firefighter Tim Holmes is overcome with emotion as he helps unveil a new statue on Tuesday that is part of a memorial to all Nashville firefighters and EMS personnel who have died in the line of duty. Firefighters in some large cities are now being trained as terrorism watchdogs, and their new role is being met with skepticism and concern by several observers.\n\nLoad-Date: November 25, 2007"
