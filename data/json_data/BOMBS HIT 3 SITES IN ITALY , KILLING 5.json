This is an attempt at intimidation. It is vital to save Italian democracy.''\nThe bombs follow May's blast in Florence in which five people died when a car bomb blew up outside the city's Uffizi gallery.\nThe bomb badly damaged the 16th century gallery, sparking fears of a wave of ''cultural terrorism,'' aimed at damaging Italy's matchless wealth of artistic heritage.\nA shadowy Italian group known as the ''Armed Falange'' claimed responsibility for the bombs, Milan's police chief Michele Serra said. It wasn't immediately clear who they are.\nSome officials had blamed the Florence bomb, and another in Rome earlier in May, on the Mafia, which they said was seeking to re-establish itself after a series of setbacks.\nA growing number of informers and police sweeps have led to the capture of several suspected Mafia leaders this year, including Salvatore ''Toto'' Riina, the alleged ''boss of bosses'' who was arrested in Sicily in January after 23 years on the run.\nBut others have pointed to more shadowy conservative forces aiming to derail Italy's drive to clean up politics in the wake of the country's devastating corruption scandal.\nPrime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said today the government would not be intimidated.\n''In the face of repeated attempts to create disorder and panic to slow the country's progress towards renovation, the government reaffirms its determination to guarantee the rights of Italians to democratic progress,'' he said in a statement.\nOne of the first leading officials to reach the St. John Lateran blast was anti-Mafia chief Bruno Siclari, but he declined immediate comment.\n\nLoad-Date: September 20, 1995"
