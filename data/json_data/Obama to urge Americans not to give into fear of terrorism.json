    "full text": "WASHINGTON • In a rare Oval Office address, President Barack Obama vowed Sunday night that the United States would overcome a new phase of the terrorist threat that aims to \"poison the minds\" of people here and around the world, as he sought to reassure Americans shaken by recent attacks in Paris and California.\n\"I know that after so much war, many Americans are asking whether we are confronted by a cancer that has no immediate cure,\" he said, speaking from a lectern in his West Wing office. \"The threat from terrorism is real, but we will overcome it,\" he declared.\nThe president's speech followed Wednesday's shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., that killed 14 people and wounded 21. Authorities say a couple carried out the attack and the wife pledged allegiance to the Islamic State and its leader in a Facebook post.\nObama said that although there was no evidence that the shooters had been directed by a terrorist network overseas or part of a broader plot, \"the two of them had gone down the dark path of radicalization.\"\n\"This was an act of terrorism designed to kill innocent people,\" he said in the 13-minute address.\nIn speaking from the Oval Office, Obama turned to a tool of the presidency that he has used infrequently. His decision to speak in prime time reflected the White House's concern that his message on the recent attacks hasn't broken through, particularly in the midst of a heated presidential campaign.\nHe announced no significant shift in U.S. strategy and offered no new policy prescriptions for defeating IS, underscoring both his confidence in his current approach and the lack of easy options for countering the extremist group.\nObama did call for cooperation between private companies and law enforcement to ensure potential attackers can't use technology to evade detection.\nHe also urged Congress to pass new force authorization for military actions underway against IS in Iraq and Syria, and also to approve legislation to bar guns from being sold to people prohibited from flying on planes in the U.S. for terrorist concerns.\nAnd he implored Americans to not turn against Muslims at home, saying the Islamic State was driven by a desire to spark a war between the West and Islam.\nStill, he called on Muslims in the U.S. and around the world to take up the cause of fighting extremism.\nThe spread of radical Islam into American communities, he said, is \"a real problem that Muslims must confront without excuse.\"\nThe president's most specific policy announcement was to order the departments of State and Homeland Security to review the fiancé visa program that the female shooter in California used to enter the U.S. In his remarks, Obama referred to a visa waiver program that Congress is also reviewing, but the White House later clarified he meant the fiancé program.\nHe also reiterated his call for broader gun control legislation, saying no matter how effective law enforcement and intelligence agencies are, they can't identify every would-be shooter. He called it a matter of national security to prevent potential killers from getting guns.\n\"What we can do, and must do, is make it harder for them to kill,\" he said.\nObama stands little chance of getting the Republican-led Congress to agree to any gun control measures.\nOn Thursday, the Senate rejected legislation barring people suspected by the government of being terrorists from buying firearms. Gun rights advocates say such a ban would violate the rights of people who haven't been convicted of crimes.\nCongress also has been unable to coalesce behind any plan to authorize more force against IS, and the administration's proposal has languished since February.\nObama repeated his long-standing opposition to an American-led ground war in the Middle East and made no mention of the more aggressive action others have suggested, including enforcing a no-fly zone and safe corridors in Syria.\n\"Our success won't depend on tough talk, or abandoning our values or giving in to fear,\" he said.\n\"Instead, we will prevail by being strong and smart, resilient and relentless.\"\nThe president's critics - and increasingly, some members of his own party - have questioned his strategy.\nAfter the speech, the president appeared as previously scheduled at the Kennedy Center Honors tribute in Washington.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n President Barack Obama addresses the nation from the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, Sunday night, Dec. 6, 2016.

The U.S. government's ability to review and analyze five years' worth of telephone records for the married couple blamed in the deadly shootings in California lapsed when the National Security Agency's controversial mass surveillance program was formally shut down, four days before the deadly California shootings. Under a court order, those historical calling records at the NSA are now off-limits to agents running the FBI terrorism investigation even with a warrant.
