Local elections administrators have undergone rigorous training and the National Guard is on call for emergencies.\nOfficials discovered in summer 2016 that a hacker had downloaded information on up 76,000 Illinois voters in what federal authorities allege was a concentrated attack by Russian intelligence agents, but whether they penetrated states other than Illinois has never been determined.\nState officials notified those affected and there's no indication that voting that fall was affected.\n\nLoad-Date: October 20, 2018"
