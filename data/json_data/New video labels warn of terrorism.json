Then they'll reassess the policy.\n\"We're trying to give our customers some more information to decide whether they want to view it or not,\" said Blockbuster spokesman Blake Lugash. \"People have different levels of sensitivity, and we want to make sure we're sensitive to that fact.\"\nDebora Knudsen of St. Petersburg said the move is a \"good extra step.\"\n\"If I had lost someone in the terrorist attacks, I wouldn't want to watch a movie (with) people getting blown up,\" she said.\nA number of independent video stores in the bay area said they have not seen a need to enact similar policies.\n\"I hadn't heard anything about it,\" said Susan Strickland, manager of Video Gallery Super Store in Seffner. \"I don't think it's necessary.\"\nLugash said Blockbuster has labeled several movies and games. Along with John Travolta'sSwordfish, the labels are on The Point Men and Ticker.\nCustomer Judy Simon isn't sure the warnings are needed. \"There's a synopsis on the back of the box,\" she said. \"People can read about the movie before they rent it.\"\n\nLoad-Date: November 17, 2001"
