There seemed to be an inexplicable ignorance about war and cultures, about how these things are never that simple and about the realistic limits of American capability. In short, as a country, we seemed to be dumb, arrogant and irresponsible in how we were about to use our power.\nIt appears that our Congress, news media and citizens bumbled right along with our president's \"plan.\"\nAt the least, the United States owes the world, particularly the innocent civilians of Iraq, and our military an apology and restitution.\nMary Collier\nBeavercreek, Ohio\n'Determination and courage'\nIt is tragic that journalists are sometimes excessively cynical about President Bush's plans for Iraq.\nThe president's leadership style reflects boldness in military actions against international terrorist threats. The media struggle to offer a comprehensive picture of Bush's effectiveness because current events lead journalists to focus on a small slice of his work. The war in Iraq represents a major challenge to the president's legacy because U.S. soldiers continue to die and the region remains unstable.\nBush's idealism in foreign affairs is sometimes misunderstood as being a source of weakness. Instead, it reflects his determination and courage to rebuild Iraq in the midst of extremely difficult circumstances.\nAmericans appreciate having political leaders who are visionary and single-minded in their international policies. There are numerous people who do not like our war in Iraq, but the world is a safer place because of our military presence.\nBrent Muirhead\nAlpharetta, Ga.\n'Hopes and wishes'\nMy outlook for 2005 is shaped by my hopes and wishes.\nAs we embark on a new year in our war in Iraq, I wish that the daily toll in lives, especially those of innocent women and children, declines. I hope the upcoming elections can be held under some semblance of security and legitimacy, and that they will mark the beginning of reconciliation, of law and order, and of peace -- not necessarily of democracy, as we seem to be mandating.\nI hope the Iraqis themselves, assisted by a coalition of the truly willing, not the coerced, will be able to maintain their own security and make it possible for our brave but overstretched troops to begin the journey home.\nFinally, I hope that our leaders will at long last start leveling with the American people on the true reasons, costs and consequences of this and any other contemplated conflict. I hope that they begin to learn from past mistakes, even if they do not admit to ever making any.\nDorian de Wind\nAustin\nMiddle East\nWith the passing of Yasser Arafat and the subsequent void in the Palestinian Authority, the Middle East players have the best chance in recent memory to forge ahead with a renewed peace initiative.\nI'm very optimistic that new Palestinian leadership will err on the side of wisdom by choosing peaceful negotiations rather than the tools of terrorism.\nIt will be a decisive year as new moderate leaders attempt to gain peaceful co-existence with the Israelis while dealing with extremist groups within their ranks, such as Hamas and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade.\nThe year 2005 will be a \"make or break\" year for the Middle East. If things go well between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, it could provide the impetus to deal with the bigger reality of worldwide terrorism.\nIf things do not change and the cycle of violence continues in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, then 2005 will be no different from previous years.\nTensions may initially get worse, but I am optimistic that significant strides to the \"road map to peace\" will begin in 2005.\nPaul Golden\nClarks Summit, Pa.\n'Pivotal' time in struggle\nThe year 2005 will prove to be pivotal in our struggle against terrorism and radicalism in the Middle East.\nAs numerous independent reports have indicated, U.S. policies toward Iraq and Israel have been extremely unpopular throughout the Middle East and have been a boon to radical groups that capitalize on widespread resentment of the United States to find willing recruits.\nThe surest way to curb our unpopularity, stabilize Iraq and prevail over terrorism is to broker a fair solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- one that satisfies basic Palestinian rights to freedom, statehood and restitution.\nWe must end the double standard we have demonstrated through nearly four decades of financing and condoning Israeli occupation and settlement of Palestinian land.\nWe must join with the international community and demand that Israel abandon its illegal settlements and wall in the West Bank and work with Palestinians and Arab states to achieve a comprehensive peace.\nWe cannot afford to continue to allow the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to undermine our efforts to stabilize the region.\nThe success of our troops in Iraq and the triumph over radical ideologies will depend on our ability to demonstrate to the Arab and Muslim world that freedom and human rights are universal principles that apply equally to Palestinians -- not simply convenient slogans used to advance political interests.\nKen Galal\nSan Francisco\nGreat need for peace\nConsidering the links among terrorism, the Middle East and Iraq, I see a great need for an Israeli-Palestinian resolution.\nShould a fair peace, land rights and a reconstruction policy be enacted, much of the wind will come out of the radical Islamists' sails.\nAside from deflating the false charges made by these radicals against the United States, an honest rapprochement of the Israelis and Palestinians with a program for housing, jobs and utilities could spur the disparate ethnic and religious groups in Iraq to cooperate to create a better country.\nThis would stabilize the oil supply in Iraq and weaken Osama bin Laden's invective against production and supply from Saudi Arabia.\nWhy not expect Israel to become an honest broker for a more egalitarian society and a supplier of goods, technology and ideas for its neighbors?\nMitchell Bernard\nAltavista, Va.\nTerrorism\nTerrorism will remain the No. 1 concern in the coming year. Everything else will be subject to it.\nJust the threat of terrorism affects economies, industries, foreign relations and our personal security. And, sadly, the odds are good that many Americans will die from terrorism in 2005.\nTerrorism will be defeated only when those who practice it, and those whom they care for, feel more terror than they convey. Far more international cooperation will be needed to accomplish this. There can be no national, local or family sanctuaries for terrorists.\nUntil terror's defeat, our way of life and each day we celebrate are opportunities for others to do us harm.\nMel Maurer\nWestlake, Ohio\nEconomy\nIt's the economy that will be most on my mind in 2005. Rising oil prices, the falling dollar, inflation, rising interest rates, declining homes sales, high unemployment, layoffs, salary freezes, the flat or falling stock market, the ever-growing national debt and dwindling Social Security are some aspects of the economy that will keep me tossing at night.\nWill I still have a job? Will I be able to afford a house? Will my 401(k) and Social Security be around when I am ready to retire? How high will oil prices and interest rates go? And will Medicare take care of me in my old age?\nI have a lot of questions, and I would like action on these issues. They are intertwined in the economic equation that affects all of us. It's the economy -- it's definitely the economy.\nDiane E. Alter\nLong Branch, N.J.\nU.S. Supreme Court\nWithout a doubt, appointments to the U.S. Supreme Court should be considered the main issue for 2005.\nEmbryonic stem cell research is going to change the future, leading to better medicines, better treatments and the possibility of generating new organs along with spinal-cord-injury repair.\nWhether Roe vs. Wade is changed will undoubtedly be a crucial issue for the next appointee.\nWhile not advocating abortion, I do believe in a woman's right to choose. President Bush should realize that abortions will continue, legally or not. Women facing perhaps the most traumatic decision they'll ever have to make should continue to receive proper medical attention.\nAnd if we, as a society, can help cure such illnesses as Parkinson's disease, diabetes and Lou Gehrig's disease with the use of embryos that would have been discarded, or embryos that will forever be frozen in fertility clinics, then let's take that step into the future.\nI only hope that the first person to benefit from stem cells will be the ailing relative of an ultra-conservative right-winger.\nJeff C.
