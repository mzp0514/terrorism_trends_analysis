Some of those documents -- 17 letters, a number by and to Bin Laden -- were released a year after his death in a May 2012 report by the Combating Terrorism Center at the United States Military Academy at West Point. Others remain classified.\nThe letters involving Mr. Ruqai remain under seal, but prosecutors quoted translated excerpts in their filing on Friday. They have asked permission to use them from Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court.\nThe office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said in a court filing that the letters, dated June 2010 to April 2011, are admissible despite having been written years after the conduct for which Mr. Ruqai was charged. The defendant, also known as Abu Anas al-Libi, faces charges of conspiring in plots that included the 1998 bombings of two American embassies in East Africa, which killed 224 people.\nThe letters show Mr. Ruqai had ''both the means and the motivation'' to communicate directly with Bin Laden, ''then the most wanted man in the world,'' the government said. The letters also reflect his ''personal relationship with, and affection for'' Bin Laden, his knowledge of and position of trust within Al Qaeda, and ''his ongoing commitment to jihad and achieving martyrdom,'' prosecutors said.\nMr. Ruqai's lawyer, Bernard V. Kleinman, declined to comment. He is expected to respond in his own pleading.\nMr. Ruqai had served eight years in prison in Iran. He went there after fleeing Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. The letters showed that immediately upon being freed from Iran, Mr. Ruqai sent his family back to Libya and chose to rejoin Al Qaeda in Pakistan, the government said.\nThe filing also revealed that Mr. Ruqai admitted to law enforcement officials after his arrest that he joined Al Qaeda in 1989, received training in security, bomb-making, intelligence collection and forging passports, and that he served as Bin Laden's ''chief personal bodyguard.'' It said he claimed to be unaware of Al Qaeda's ''intention of targeting the West.''\nIn one of the Abbottabad letters, dated June 19, 2010, Bin Laden's deputy, Atiyah Abd al Rahman al Liby, updated his boss on various Qaeda matters, including personnel, and noted Mr. Ruqai was among ''the last brothers'' to return to Pakistan from Iran. He ''came only a week ago and I met him and sat with him,'' the deputy, known as Atiyah, said.\nAtiyah wrote that he had assigned Mr. Ruqai to serve on Al Qaeda's security committee, and pointed out that he would need assistance from others: ''It is normal for any person after a long absence, especially in jail, that he needs some time to figure out how things work.''\nMr. Ruqai ''asks about you a lot and wants reassurance about you,'' Atiyah told Bin Laden, adding, ''If you can consider sending him a letter, he will really appreciate it.''\nIn a five-page letter from Mr. Ruqai to Bin Laden, dated Oct. 13, 2010, he described how Qaeda ''brothers'' fled to Iran at the instruction of the Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, and were detained, including ''your sons'' and other Qaeda leaders like Sulaiman Abu Ghaith (the Bin Laden son-in-law who was later tried and convicted in New York). ''Your forever lover, Your brother,'' Mr. Ruqai signed the letter.\nAbout a month later, Bin Laden's deputy wrote to Bin Laden and included Mr. Ruqai on a list of people he recommended to take on additional leadership responsibilities. ''You know him,'' Atiyah told Bin Laden, adding Mr. Ruqai was ''determined'' and ''visionary,'' but could be ''difficult somewhat.''\nAtiyah noted that Mr. Ruqai had violated Al Qaeda's security protocols by ''contacting his family in Libya, despite knowing that we don't allow any communications.''\n''He knows that he was wanted by the Americans,'' the deputy wrote to Bin Laden. ''He contacted them via phone repeatedly!''\nIn March 2011, Mr. Ruqai sought permission to return to Libya with others, referring to the Libyan uprising against Muammar el-Qaddafi and saying they must ''move out sooner rather than later'' to avoid becoming prisoners of war.\nThe letter was eventually forwarded to Bin Laden by Atiyah, who himself was in hiding. Atiyah said he granted Mr. Ruqai permission to travel to Libya, adding that Mr. Ruqai was ''a little upset with me for the delay in getting back to him.''\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/16/nyregion/us-seeks-to-use-letters-found-in-bin-laden-raid-in-terrorism-trial.html\n\nLoad-Date: December 16, 2014"
