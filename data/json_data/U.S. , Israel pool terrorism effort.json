Senior U.S. and Israeli officials discussed the details until 3 a.m., and then Deutch and Christopher approved shipments with Peres, who is also Israel's defense minister.\nAt a news conference, Christopher said most of the equipment would be delivered in the next few weeks.\nWhile Israel and the Clinton administration are promoting cooperation with Palestinian police in tracking down terrorists in Gaza and on the West Bank, Peres and U.S. officials said sophisticated U.S. technology would not be shared with the Palestinian Authority.\nPeres has accused Yasser Arafat, chairman of the authority, of not taking strong and swift action against Hamas, the group that claimed responsibility for four suicide bombings in Israel that killed 62 people and shook Israel's confidence in trading land for peace.\n\nLoad-Date: December 9, 1996"
