    "full text": "By the time Fox decided to cancel \"24,\" most viewers with any sense had long ago abandoned the series. Though never the most realistic show on television, the plots became even more ludicrous and baroque in recent years.\nKiefer Sutherland portrays the show's counter-terrorist \"hero\" Jack Bauer like a husky-voiced ghost. There's a deadness in Mr. Sutherland's performance that never deviates until Bauer is screaming into a villain's face at the beginning of a torture session.\nJack Bauer was on the receiving end of torture by Russian gangsters earlier this season, but the rogue counter-terrorism agent has proven himself absolutely Cheneyesque in his ability to dish it out in recent weeks.\nLast week, Bauer used pliers on the nipples of the Russian assassin who murdered his lover. He then applied flame from a blow torch to the killer's face and body.\nDuring the session, the defiant killer refused to give Bauer the information he wanted despite his ordeal, proving what people of conscience already know -- torture doesn't work.\nAt one point, the killer spat in Bauer's face. It isn't every day that an audience's sympathy switches away from the hero and to the guy who was part of a conspiracy to detonate a dirty bomb in New York City hours earlier.\nWithout weighing the morality of his act, Bauer gutted the Russian like a pig to extract a cellphone SIM card he suspected was hidden in the killer's intestinal track.\nAs Jack Bauer picked through the Russian's stomach, it was obvious that those of us who continue to watch \"24\" are about as morally compromised as any television audience has ever been.\nThe previous week, Bauer pursued a double agent who shot several civilians standing between her and freedom. After extracting the information he needed, Bauer shot the now-unarmed woman at close range.\nMonday night, Jack Bauer probably did something unthinkable -- again. I have no idea what it was since this column was written hours before the episode aired. If last week's coming attractions are an indication, Bauer succeeded in kidnapping a former American president with inside knowledge of a Russian plot to murder a Middle Eastern leader and detonate a dirty bomb on American soil.\nDid Bauer torture the Nixonesque former president to get information about the conspiracy? Even that might be a bridge too far for the series most responsible for setting the tone for human rights abuses at Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib during the Bush years, but I wouldn't put it past him.\nThough the paranoid politics of \"24\" became more anachronistic and embarrassing with each year the show overstayed its welcome, some of its most dubious practices have quietly entered the mainstream of American political thought.\nSpooked by criticism from the right that it has been too quick to Mirandize terrorism suspects, the Obama administration has signaled that it is open to taking a harder line against Americans rounded up in terrorist plots. (You never see Jack Bauer reading an American conspirator his Miranda rights, do you?)\nThis follows the Obama administration's cowardly retreat from prosecuting the suspected Sept. 11 conspirators in New York. Pressure is building to prosecute the terror suspects in a military tribunal far removed from American soil -- preferably Gitmo.\nAttorney General Eric Holder insists that the Justice Department hasn't ruled out a civilian trial, but the administration hasn't shown much of a spine when it comes to protecting civil liberties if conservative critics squawk loud enough. More than anything, it wants to look tough -- though not necessarily Jack Bauer tough.\nMeanwhile, there is hardly a ripple of dissent about assigning drones to kill a radical Muslim American preacher in Yemen who inspires hatred and terrorism against the country of his birth.\nIt may be coming to an end on TV in a few weeks, but the odious politics of \"24\" will remain with us for a long time.\n\nNotes\n\nTony Norman: tnorman@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1631./\n\nLoad-Date: May 18, 2010"
