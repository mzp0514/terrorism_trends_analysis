    "full text": "British non-life insurers posted dramatically improved underwriting results in 1992, but insurers still posted an overall loss for the third year in a row.\nU.K. insurers had an overall loss of 707 million pounds ($ 1.07 billion) at year-end 1992, which was equal to 2.3% of total net premiums written of 31.1 billion pounds ($ 47.10 billion), according to the Assn. of British Insurers.\nIn 1991, British insurers posted a 3.3 billion pound ($ 6.17 billion) loss, or 12% of the 27.3 billion pounds ($ 50.91 billion) in net premiums written (BI, June 29, 1992).\nThe improved figures are the result of ''reduced operating expenses, loss-prevention initiatives, lower claims and rating increases,'' the ABI said.\n''The non-life insurance industry has faced major and fundamental challenges over the last three years,'' said outgoing ABI Chairman Ian Rushton, referring to the horrendous losses that U.K. insurers have faced since 1989, particularly for mortgage indemnity insurance claims. ''Insurance companies have taken action to put the industry back on the right track, but we still have some way to go to return to full profitability with an adequate return on capital employed.''\nDeclining investment returns are forcing the industry to significantly reduce underwriting losses over the coming year to ensure a return to profitability, he warned.\nThe ABI late last month tallied the results of its 450 members, which account for 90% of all U.K. insurance business.\nResults showed that premiums for all types of non-life insurance increased last year. Fire and accident net written premiums increased 12.5% to 18.5 billion pounds ($ 28.02 billion); automobile premiums increased 14.1% to 10.4 billion pounds ($ 15.75 billion); and marine, aviation and transport premiums increased 26.2% to 2.3 billion pounds ($ 3.48 billion).\nLess than 10%, or 3.8 billion pounds ($ 5.76 billion), of U.K. insurers' total worldwide non-life net written premiums was generated in the United States, but that is still more than the just-under 3 billion pounds ($ 4.54 billion) generated from E.C. countries. More than half, or nearly 19 billion pounds ($ 28.78 billion), comes from U.K. domestic business.\nMeanwhile, the ABI membership's total ''long-term'' net premiums written rose 10.2% last year to 52.3 billion pounds ($ 79.21 billion). Long-term business includes personal and group life insurance, personal pensions and savings plans. There are 40.8 million personal life policies in force in the United Kingdom and another 45.6 billion commercial life policies.  The total sum insured under these policies is 600 billion pounds ($ 908.1 billion), according to the ABI.\nThere are 6.9 million employees involved in corporate pension programs that are funded by life insurance companies and 16.6 million personal pension plans in force. Over 12 billion pounds ($ 18.17 billion) was paid out by the life insurance industry for pension plans, death claims, lump sums or as refunds last year.\nMeanwhile, the ABI said that two major London bombings in as many years by the Irish Republican Army together will cost insurers an estimated 850 million pounds ($ 1.09 billion) (BI, May 3; April 20, 1992).\nMr. Rushton welcomed the government's decision last December to act as reinsurer of last resort for terrorism coverage. The Reinsurance (Acts of Terrorism) bill was passed in May, authorizing the startup of Pool Re, the mutual reinsurance company backed by government guarantees (BI, May 31; May 17).\n''The aim must be to encourage as big and as wide a takeup as possible of terrorism cover,'' he said.\nMr. Rushton didn't mention the ABI's feud with the government over proposed rate hikes for Pool Re coverage beginning with July renewals (BI, June 28).\nIn its annual report, the ABI also said it awaits a House of Lords decision on which policyholders are eligible for protection under the Policyholders Protection Act before it continues discussions with the Department of Trade and Industry on amending the act (BI, March 29). The act pays ''private policyholders'' holding ''U.K. policies'' 90% of all claims if a U.K. insurer goes into liquidation. This guarantee is paid by a levy on ABI members.\nThe House of Lords is expected in the next few weeks to hand down its decision that will determine whether U.S. professionals are covered under the act."
