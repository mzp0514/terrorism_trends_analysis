    "full text": "WASHINGTON - The Senate plans to push hard to give the FBI tools to \"trap and trace\" Internet plots against the U.S. by Osama Bin Laden and other extremists, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said yesterday.\nSchumer's vow came on the heels of a report in USA Today that Bin Laden has been using Web sites and chat rooms to convey coded messages and photographs of possible terrorism targets to his cohorts.\nBulletin boards carrying pornographic and sports information, which get huge numbers of hits, are among the most popular hosts for extremist groups such as Bin Laden's, said cyberintelligence expert Ben Venzke.\nHe cited the example of a picture labeled \"blond bombshell\" posted on a bulletin board that probably would be downloaded by thousands of users unaware of an encrypted message hidden in the image.\n\"We're doing virtually nothing on this,\" Schumer said.\nHe said he would co-sponsor a bill with Sen. John Kyl (R-Ariz.) to allow the FBI to seek \"nationwide trap and trace authority\" from a single court order.\nThe bill, which he said has broad support, would give law enforcement the authority to track a suspicious online communication from start to finish without seeking separate court orders for each jurisdiction the message travels through, he said.\n\nLoad-Date: February 7, 2001"
