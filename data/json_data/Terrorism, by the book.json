He doesn't want to give potential terrorists his secrets. But he says such training has become a greater need since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in New York and Washington, D.C.\nThe institute seeks to train people what to do once terrorism strikes.\n\"Once it's there, you're stuck with it,\" Dose said recently. \"The more people understand about terrorism and how it works, the less effective it is.\"\nUsing state and federal grants, the 18-month-old institute already has trained thousands of government workers.\nPart of NIC's Work Force Training Center, the institute has offered computer-based training to more than 15,000 Idaho emergency workers who would be the first to arrive at a terrorist incident.\nSeveral churches, which Dose declined to identify, have sent missionaries to the institute's courses on how to survive or escape captivity while working in foreign countries.\nNext month, the institute will begin training about 30 Idaho National Guard personnel in Boise.\nIdaho National Guard Maj. Gen. Jack Kane, the state's homeland security director, called the training invaluable, particularly to Guardsmen being deployed throughout the world.\n\"For the military, anti-terrorism training has become more and more valuable in recent years,\" he said in a statement. \"I think this is some of the best training of this sort to be found in the country, and it's located right here in Idaho.\"\nThe institute already was on the drawing board when terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in 2001.\nDose a former county commissioner, cop, teacher and Department of Defense consultant had an office within a month of the attacks. Two months later, the institute was officially a part of the college.\nAlthough affiliated with NIC, classes are not offered to the public.\n\"We don't teach Terrorism 101 at North Idaho College,\" said Randy Spivey, Dose's security adviser.\nThe courses, which last from 30 minutes to as many as five days, offer corporations and organizations \"a cafeteria plan\" tailored to their security needs and budgets, Dose said.\nCourses are taught at the institute's office in a business park, or at the client's site and can involve as few as a dozen to more than 500 employees at a time.\nFor instance, a course in countersurveillance techniques includes a field trip to downtown Coeur d'Alene, where participants shop and try to detect if they are being followed by law enforcement agents hired by the institute, Dose said.\nHe won't say what the courses cost, but says they are \"very affordable\" when compared to what private security companies charge. The amount is dependent on the level of training sought, he said.\nDose said the program takes information from federal sources and literature on terrorism incidents.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nGregory M.
