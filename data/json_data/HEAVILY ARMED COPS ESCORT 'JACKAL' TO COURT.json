The bombing in Paris was among the lesser of the crimes he is suspected of.\nA day after being secretly flown to France, Carlos was escorted into a\nclosed hearing at the Palais de Justice by five policemen carrying assault rifles and wearing bulletproof vests. Chains stood out against his white pants, beige sweater and brown slip-on shoes.\nWitnesses said he casually talked with his guards about guns and then threw out some quips at the entrance of Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere, France's renowned judge of terrorism cases who travels with a bodyguard and carries a concealed pistol.\n\"Ah, here's the judge, how's it going?\" Carlos said to Bruguiere, speaking French.\n\"And you?\" Bruguiere replied.\n\"Still alive, for a long time to come,\" answered Carlos, whose death had been rumored numerous times in recent years. Then, to his escorts, he added, \"This guy, he's a star.\"\nInitially assigned three court-appointed attorneys, Carlos took on noted lawyer Jacques Verges, who has made a career of defending notorious people, including Gestapo chief Klaus Barbie and Magdalena Kopp, a West German terrorist who reportedly married Carlos after a term in a French prison.\nCarlos was charged with masterminding a 1982 bombing just off Paris' Champs Elysees that killed one person and wounded 63.\nHe will be charged later by a panel of judges with the fatal shooting of two counterintelligence agents in 1975. A French court convicted him in absentia in 1992 and sentenced him to life in prison for those slayings, but under French law he will have to be retried.\nInterior Minister Charles Pasqua, announcing the arrest Monday, said Carlos claims to have killed 83 people around the world. He said Carlos was directly or indirectly responsible for killing at least 15 people in France and injuring 200.\nPasqua said Sudan informed France on Sunday that Carlos was in custody and offered to turn him over to French authorities.\nThe leftist newspaper Liberation said today that in return, French intelligence gave the Sudanese government satellite photographs pinpointing positions of the Popular Army for the Liberation of South Sudan, a rebel group.\nFrance also agreed to use its influence to win permission for Sudanese troops to pass through the Central African Republic and attack the rebels from the south, Liberation said. The newspaper did not cite any sources.\nReponding on French radio, Pasqua said France \"gave nothing in exchange\" for Carlos' extradition.\nBut a defense attorney, Mourad Oussedik, claimed Sudan's government had been harboring Carlos and betrayed him to France.\n\"There was no extradition demand,\" Oussedik said on French radio. \"It was a kidnapping following transactions between the French and Sudanese governments.\"\n\nLoad-Date: October 18, 2002"
