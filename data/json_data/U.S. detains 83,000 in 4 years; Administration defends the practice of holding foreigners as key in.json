    "full text": "The United States has detained more than 83,000 foreigners in the four years of the war on terror, enough to nearly fill the NFL's largest stadium.\nThe administration defends the practice of holding detainees in prisons from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay as a critical tool to stop the insurgency in Iraq, maintain stability in Afghanistan and get known and suspected terrorists off the streets.\nRoughly 14,500 detainees remain in U.S. custody, primarily in Iraq.\nThe number has steadily grown since the first CIA paramilitary officers touched down in Afghanistan in the fall of 2001, setting up more than 20 facilities including the \"Salt Pit,\" an abandoned factory outside Kabul used for CIA detention and interrogation.\nIn Iraq, the number in military custody hit a peak on Nov. 1, according to military figures. Nearly 13,900 suspects were in U.S. custody there that day - partly because U.S. offensives in western Iraq put pressure on insurgents before the October constitutional referendum and December parliamentary elections.\nThe detentions and interrogations have brought complaints from Congress and human-rights groups about how the detainees - often Arab and male - are treated.\nInternational law and treaty obligations forbid torture and inhumane treatment. Classified memos have given the government ways to extract intelligence from detainees \"consistent with the law,\" administration officials often say.\nOn Capitol Hill, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is leading a campaign to ban cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of prisoners in U.S. custody. The administration says the legislation could tie the president's hands. Vice President Dick Cheney has pressed lawmakers to exempt the CIA.\n\"There's an enemy that lurks and plots and plans and wants to hurt America again. And so you bet we will aggressively pursue them. But we will do so under the law,\" President Bush said last week.\nSome 82,400 people have been detained by the military alone in Afghanistan and Iraq, according to figures from officials in Baghdad and Washington. Many are freed shortly after initial questioning.\nIn Iraq, the Defense Department says 5,569 detainees have been held for more than six months, and 3,801 have been held more than a year. Some 229 have been locked up for more than two years.\n\nLoad-Date: November 17, 2005"
