The motive for the attack was not clear.\nPolice said a 19-year-old man was killed and three of the others were in critical condition following what was described as a \"frenzied\" attack.\nThe assault occurred near a subway station in a suburb of Lyon on Saturday.\nThe suspect provided contradictory information to police, but the attack in the town of Villeurbanne did not appear to be terrorism-related, the official told The Associated Press. A second source close to the police said the man had told officers he was an Afghan national. Police are still looking for possible accomplices.\nState health officials issue warning about mosquito-borne disease\nLimit the number of places around your home for mosquitoes to breed by draining or discarding items that hold water. State health officials urged people to stay indoors from dusk until dawn and use mosquito repellent when outdoors.\nThe attack happened at around 4:30 pm (1430 GMT) at a bus stop near the local station.\nPolice, who are yet to confirm the nature of the attack, have sealed off roads near the scene and have asked the public to avoid the area as it is an active crime scene.\nLast May, a parcel bomb in front of a baker's shop in central Lyon slightly injured 14 people.\nLyon, France's third city, had until then remained untouched by the wave of jihadist attacks that have killed 251 people in France since 2015.\n\nLoad-Date: September 1, 2019"
