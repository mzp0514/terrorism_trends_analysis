R. Jayewardene said in an interview.\nSri Lanka Pres J R Jayewardene says his country will not pay ransom to kidnappers of American couple, Stanley and Mary Elizabeth Allen, in area where Tamil rebels are fighting to establish separate state; says 'we will not bargain with terrorists' (S)''No gold, no release of prisoners, no nothing. We don't bargain with terrorists.''\nMeanwhile, Government officials said they did not know whether the American couple, Stanley and Mary Elizabeth Allen of Ohio, were still in the country. The Allens were kidnapped Thursday night from their home in Jaffna in the largely Tamil north by an organization calling itself the People's Liberation Army. The kidnappers said in a note that they wanted $2.5 million in gold and the release of 20 jailed people suspected of terrorism.\nThe kidnappers said the gold was to be given to one of their representatives in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, where the state government has supported the agitation for a separate Tamil state.\nThe kidnappers threatened to kill their hostages if their demands were not met by noon Monday. If the demands were met, the kidnappers said, the couple would be released somewhere abroad. The Allens were working on a water-supply project sponsored by the United States Agency for International Development."
