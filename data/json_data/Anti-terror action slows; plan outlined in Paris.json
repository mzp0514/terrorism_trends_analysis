Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said Clinton won't\nget all the \"controversial provisions\" he wants.\nAnd Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he doubted\nCongress would act this week, as Clinton has asked.\nOne of the issues of contention: Some lawmakers say expanded wiretapping\nauthority could lead to invasions of privacy by the government.\nAs lawmakers in Washington locked horns, representatives from\nthe United States and other nations were planning an international\nresponse to terrorism.\nIn Paris, leaders of eight nations vowed cooperative action against\nterrorism.\nBritain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the\nUnited States agreed:\n-- To police the Internet.\n-- To set global standards for detecting bombs.\n-- To tighter border checks.\nCalling terrorism an attempt to undermine civility, U.S. Attorney\nGeneral Janet Reno said, \"Today we have stood together, resolute\nin our determination not to let this happen.\"\n\nLoad-Date: July 31, 1996"
