''This fact outweighs not only the high cost of maintaining Guantánamo -- which costs more than $114 million a year -- but also provides the same degree of security without the criticism of operating a military prison in an isolated location.''\nThe study said that six Defense Department prisons and 98 Justice Department prisons could take the detainees, but that they probably would need to be modified and that some inmates might need to be relocated.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/29/us/government-report-supports-closing-guantanamo-prison.html\n\nLoad-Date: November 29, 2012"
