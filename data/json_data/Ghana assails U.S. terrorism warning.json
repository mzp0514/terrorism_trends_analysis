    "full text": "ACCRA, Ghana (AP) -- Ghana has criticized U.S. intelligence reports that American facilities here may be terrorist targets, saying they undermine the West African nation's image as a safe haven for foreign investors.\nIn a statement issued late Friday, the Foreign Ministry expressed surprise and dismay at recent reports suggesting African nations such as Ghana or Mozambique -- where security tends to be more lax than in the West -- could be the next targets of suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden.\nThe exiled Saudi millionaire, whom the United States accuses of ordering last year's bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, is said by U.S. intelligence to be in the advanced stages of planning another attack.\nGhana has been committed to working closely with the United States on matters of national security, \"sharing information and adopting measures aimed at combating threats posed by terrorism,\" the Foreign Ministry said.\nIt expressed regret that the announcement undermined Ghana's image of peace, stability and goodwill.\n\"At a time when Ghana is making serious efforts to boost investor confidence in its economy and political arrangements, such wrong impressions as the U.S. State Department statement has sought to create is grossly unfair and goes against the grain of the cooperative ties between the two countries,\" it said.\n\nLoad-Date: June 20, 1999"
