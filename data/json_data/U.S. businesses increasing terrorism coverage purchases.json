    "full text": "U.S. businesses' appetite for terrorism risk insurance is still on the upswing, according to a study released last week by Marsh Inc.\nNew York-based Marsh found about 44% of the more than 600 public and private entities surveyed nationwide that had bought or renewed property coverage in the first quarter of the year also bought terrorism coverage. That compares with 32.7% of respondents to an earlier Marsh survey of entities that bought or renewed property coverage in the fourth quarter of 2003.\nMarsh attributed the increase in 2004 to several factors: a drop in property/casualty rates that freed up money to add terrorism insurance, the willingness of more underwriters to price terrorism coverage at affordable rates and some underwriters' decision to expand coverage for certain terrorism-related losses beyond that required by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act.\nOrganizations with total insured property values of $1 billion or more were the most likely to buy terrorism coverage, at a purchasing rate of 63% of that class during the first quarter of the year. Transportation companies were the industry group most likely to buy the coverage, with 57% of the respondents in that category reporting they had bought terrorism coverage in the first quarter of this year.\nCopies of the report can be requested by e-mail to gail.murray-mccarthy@ marsh.com or by contacting a Marsh office. \n\nLoad-Date: June 23, 2004"
