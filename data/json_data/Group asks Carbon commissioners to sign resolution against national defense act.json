I'm considering signing it,\" he said.\nHe was quickly backed up by Vice Chairman Tom Gerhard, who said he's also considering signing it.\nMinority Commissioner William O'Gurek was asked by Norato if he would sign it.\nHe said no. \"I don't think there is anything in the act that violates the law.\"\nO'Gurek said the intent of the law is to deal with the threat posed to America, and noted that is one of the reasons why U.S. men and women are fighting wars in foreign countries.\n\"I stand behind our troops who are dealing with al-Qaida and the Taliban and any terrorists who are opposing the U.S.,\" O'Gurek said.\nHe said the provisions apply only to non-lawful people connected to al-Qaida and associates, which is in line with what America is trying to do.\nThe detention provisions of the act have been criticized by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Bill of Rights Defense Committee and others concerned about the scope of the president's authority.\nO'Gurek said nothing in the National Defense Authorization Act undermines the rights that Americans enjoy.\n\"I'm in favor of the act and I don't think it is unconstitutional,\" O'Gurek said. \"I also think it stands behind veterans who have fought to defend our country.\"\nO'Gurek said he respects the group's opinion but doesn't agree with them.\nSettlement OK'd\nThe commissioners approved a settlement of a lawsuit against the county and the prison regarding an incident in 2008 involving Leonard Cerami, an inmate at the time.\nCerami will be paid $3,000.\nHe claimed in the suit that he was violently assaulted by another inmate, Patrick Huey, who used a pen to stab Cerami and struck him in the face, causing abrasions and lacerations.\nThe suit named the county, the prison and the warden at the time (Jim Youngkin).\nController Robert Crampsie said the prison board also must approve the settlement before any payment is made.\nContractor hired\nThe commissioners awarded a contract for the installation of ductless heat pump systems at the prison to the low bidder, Master Mechanical Corp., McAdoo, for $22,725.\ntragan@standardspeaker.com\n___ (c)2012 the Standard-Speaker (Hazleton, Pa.)
