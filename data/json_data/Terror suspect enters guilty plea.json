    "full text": "PHILADELPHIA -- A Colorado woman who traveled to Ireland and married a suspected terrorist after conspiring with the Montgomery County woman who called herself \"Jihad Jane\" pleaded guilty to a terrorism charge Tuesday in federal court. \nJamie Paulin Ramirez, 32, of Leadville, Colo., was indicted in April with Colleen LaRose of Pennsburg on a single count of conspiring to provide material support to terrorists planning to \"knock down\" individuals who were harming Islam. \nAmong the people LaRose and others targeted was a Swedish cartoonist, Lars Vilks, who offended Muslims by depicting the Prophet Muhammad as a dog. \nPaulin Ramirez traveled to Ireland in September 2009 with her minor son and married a suspected terrorist identified in court documents only as co-conspirator No. 2. Her attorney, Jeremy Ibrahim, said he's not sure whether his client is still married to the man. \nPaulin Ramirez appeared before U.S. District Judge Petrese B. Tucker wearing a Muslim head scarf and green prison fatigues. She spoke softly when she answered the judge's questions. By pleading guilty, Paulin Ramirez avoids a trial but faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. \nLaRose, 47, pleaded guilty Feb. 1 to four counts, including conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists, conspiracy to kill in a foreign country, making a false statement to a government official in relation to international terrorism and attempted identity theft to aid in an act of international terrorism. She could receive a life sentence. \n\nLoad-Date: March 9, 2011"
