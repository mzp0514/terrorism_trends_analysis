    "full text": "With William Safire on vacation, we might have expected a brief respite from his Amer-centric arrogance. But fellow New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman gallantly stepped in to fill the gap.\nIn his Aug. 25 column (\"Angry Men Confront the U.S.\"), Friedman explained that terrorism is the result of \"super-empowered angry men\" who have \"no specific ideological program\" and are \"driven by a generalized hatred of the United States.\" He goes on to surmise that this hatred is rooted in a fear of globalization.\nJournalists, politicians and much of the American populace seem willfully ignorant of the less abstract motivations of anti-American terror. Osama bin Laden hardly acted alone. He and others of his ilk resent the relegation of Middle Eastern nations to the status of client-states of the United States. They resent the U.S. military presence and its control of the Middle East and its resources. Apparently we have failed to learn the obvious lesson of the 1979 revolution in Iran.\nPeople tend to get angry when a foreign power controls their country. They will lash out both at the foreign power and at the shill government that is its tool.\nUntil we admit that 50 years of American oil-controlling imperialism is the root cause of terrorism - and take some action to rectify it - angry Middle Easterners will continue to lash out against the American Goliath with the only means available.\nAnd let's not forget that when Islamic militants were fighting against Soviet occupation, they were called freedom fighters. How quickly times change.\n\nLoad-Date: September 9, 1998"
