And last year, in the heated political environment that led to Charlottesville, Va., deaths caused by white supremacists doubled year over year. Right-wing extremists were directly responsible for 20 of the total 34 extremist-related murders in 2017.\n  While the federal government builds walls and pours more resources into fighting the violent threat posed by foreign extremists, less attention is being paid to the reality of right-wing violence.\n  JONATHAN A. GREENBLATTNEW YORK\n  The writer is chief executive and national director of the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/21/opinion/terrorism-immigration.html\n\nLoad-Date: January 22, 2018"
