    "full text": "Memories of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 are burned deeply into the nation's consciousness, and Americans today are as fearful of becoming a victim of terrorism as they are of losing their job or having their home burglarized.\nIn a measure of the trauma of that day, an Associated Press poll found that 98 percent remember exactly what they were doing three years ago when hijackers flew jetliners into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, killing almost 3,000.\nThose memories can resurface with the most routine cues, a plane flying overhead, a siren from a passing ambulance or news about the ongoing war in Iraq.\n\"I hardly go to Manhattan any more,\" said Andre Garcia, a 20-year-old student from the Bronx borough of New York City. \"I don't call it a fear, I call it 'me being safe,' I don't want to be over there when it happens.\"\nFor most, the dominant feeling about that day was deep anger that anyone would commit such an act against this country, the poll conducted for the AP by Ipsos-Public Affairs found. Republicans and Democrats were equally likely to say they felt that way.\nAbout four in 10 Americans say they worry about becoming a victim of terrorism. That's about the same level of concern people have about getting burglarized or losing their job.\nWomen were more likely than men to worry about being victimized by terrorists, but they were also more likely to worry about other things such as a burglary or having a car accident.\nWhen people are asked who they blame for the terrorist attacks, most name the terrorists, but seven in 10 said they blame the CIA and almost that many faulted the FBI and airline security.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPoll concerning terrorism fears\n\nLoad-Date: September 10, 2004"
