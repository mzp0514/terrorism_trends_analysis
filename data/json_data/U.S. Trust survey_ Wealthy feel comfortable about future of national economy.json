    "full text": "Though terrorism still weighs heavily on the minds of the affluent, a higher percentage of the wealthy set feels comfortable about the future of the national economy, according to a U.S. Trust survey released Tuesday.\nThe U.S. Trust Survey of Affluent Americans found that 77 percent believed terrorism would hurt the economy. That's the same percentage that worried about terrorism last year. Also, 56 percent of the 150 people surveyed said terrorism threatened their personal security.\nAt the same time, 83 percent said their kids will have it tougher financially, making that the biggest worry of the affluent.\n\"That's been the case since the inception of the survey 25 years ago,\" said William J. Porter Jr., regional president and managing director of U.S. Trust on Long Island.\nThe overall outlook was rosy. For instance, the Affluent Investor Index hit 63, well up from 48 in 2005.\n\"Ninety-one percent said their portfolio went up,\" Porter said. \"Last year, 81 percent said their portfolio went up. Only 3 percent said it went down this year. \"\nAs for the typical affluent investment portfolio, 21 percent of investments are in domestic blue-chip stocks, followed by 15 percent in cash and 15 percent in real estate investments.\n\nLoad-Date: June 6, 2006"
