He is now under arrest. His lawyer in Brussels did not return calls seeking comment.\nEric Van Der Sypt of the Belgian federal prosecutor's office said by telephone on Monday that releasing the identities of the two dead suspects in Verviers would jeopardize the investigation, but did not elaborate. He cautioned that the extradition from Greece of the detained Algerian, who is wanted in connection with the Belgian terror case, could take weeks if he fights Belgium's request in court.\nMr. Reynders and other ministers called for the establishment of a European system for exchanging passenger information, similar to one introduced in the United States after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\nProposals for such a program in Europe were put forward years ago but were stalled because of opposition from the European Parliament, where many lawmakers worried about violating citizens' privacy.\nUnder the program, information about seat numbers, flight reservation dates, payment methods and travel itineraries would be exchanged. Mr. Reynders suggested that such a system could have helped prevent an attack in May on the Jewish Museum in Brussels that left four people dead. The main suspect in that case, Mehdi Nemmouche, traveled from France to Syria before returning to Belgium, Mr. Reynders said.\n''If we don't know the route, if we don't have the chance to follow people step by step, we can't make progress,'' he said.\nShortly after the shooting in Brussels last year, the French authorities apprehended Mr. Nemmouche during a routine customs check as he arrived by bus in Marseille from Brussels still carrying an assault rifle and a revolver.\nMs. Mogherini, the foreign affairs chief, said the European Union would also step up efforts to block the financing of terrorism, another program inspired by measures taken by the United States but long stalled by privacy and other concerns.\nShe said European officials would meet in the coming days with officials from the United States, Canada, Japan and other nations to discuss ways to counter the financing of the militant group the Islamic State.\nSeveral thousand young European Muslims have traveled to Syria and Iraq to join the Islamic State and other extremist groups, a jihadist pipeline that has helped spread extremist views inside Europe and raised fears that fighters will return home to carry out terrorist attacks.\nAmedy Coulibaly, a Paris gunman of African descent who killed four hostages at a kosher supermarket on Jan. 9, said he was acting on behalf of the Islamic State. The Belgian authorities have said that the plot they disrupted last week involved several people who had returned from Syria.\nThe foreign ministers' meeting was the first of senior European Union officials since the three-day rampage that killed 17 people in Paris and raised worries across Europe that Muslim extremists may be gearing up for more attacks.\nConcerned about potential attacks on Jewish sites, embassies and other possible targets, Belgium on Saturday deployed 150 paratroopers in Brussels, the capital, and in Antwerp, a diamond-trading center with a large Orthodox Jewish population. It was the first time troops had been used for domestic security in more than 20 years.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/20/world/europe/europe-foreign-ministers-security-terrorism.html\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO: From left, Foreign Affairs Minister Laurent Fabius of France, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond  of Britain and Federica Mogherini, the European Union's foreign affairs chief, in Belgium.
