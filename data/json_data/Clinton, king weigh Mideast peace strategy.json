    "full text": "Declaring that Mideast leaders should show a \"zero-tolerance\" for terrorism, President Clinton said Tuesday that violence should never be used to further political goals.\n\"What we have to do is to restore the environment of security and confidence,\" Clinton said at the start of a White House meeting with King Hussein of Jordan.\n\"It's an urgent thing for me and for the whole peace process.\"\nWith new violence today in Gaza, Clinton said he did not believe \"there is any excuse for terrorism in any case.\"\n\"Terrorism is wrong,\" he said.\nClinton said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had taken some steps to discourage violence against Israel, but said an unambiguous declaration against terrorism was a precondition for reopening peace talks.\nIsrael must have security to go ahead with peacemaking and the Palestinians must have confidence the outcome of the talks was not being predetermined.\nIn this vein, Clinton again criticized Israel for going ahead with a housing project in east Jerusalem. The United States opposed two U.N. resolutions condemning the Israeli action because the wording tended to prejudge the outcome of the talks.\n\"This is a difficult time for the peace process, and we've got a lot to talk about,\" he said. Praising Hussein as a courageous peacemaker, Clinton said a comprehensive peace in the area was impossible without him.\nClinton said he held extensive meetings with American mediator Dennis B. Ross, on Monday and again today. Ross met separately last week with Arafat and with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanuyahu.\n\"Unambiguously, a precondition for going forward is a commitment for zero-tolerance for terrorism,\" Clinton said.\n\nLoad-Date: April 7, 1997"
