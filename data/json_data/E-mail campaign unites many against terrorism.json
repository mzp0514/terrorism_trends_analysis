    "full text": "It started out as just someone's idea: Go outside and light a candle tonight at 7.\nThanks to e-mail and the Internet, the idea spread across the country in a matter of hours.\nFrom the rubble-strewn streets of New York City to the West Coast, with electronic stops along the way in Philadelphia and its suburbs, the e-mail moved along, urging hundreds, perhaps thousands of people to join in a candle-lighting on the day also declared a day of prayer and remembrance by President Bush.\n\"How it started, I don't know,\" said Alexander E. Shin, owner of Sir Speedy printers in Center City. \"But we've got to do something just to participate.\"\nShin got the e-mail from his sister in New York. Their brother was trapped in one of the World Trade Center towers for an hour before he escaped, Shin said.\n\"Friday Night at 7:00 p.m. step out your door, stop your car, or step out of your establishment and light a candle,\" the e-mail said. \"We will show the world that Americans are strong and united together against terrorism.\"\nShin, for one, sent the message to hundreds more and printed and posted flyers urging people to participate.\n\"I'm going to take one home and hang it on my street,\" said Roddy Bock of the Archway Pizza & Sandwich Shop on North Eighth Street. \"Everyone's American and they should be proud to show they're Americans at a time like this.\"\nJoanne Wallace of Horsham said she got the e-mail and bought 350 candles to pass out at her son's Horsham Hawks football game tonight.\n\nNotes\n\nA Day of Terror: The Aftermath\n\nLoad-Date: October 31, 2001"
