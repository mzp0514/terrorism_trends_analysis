    "full text": "An estimated $15.5 billion worth of commercial real estate projects that stalled as developers scrambled to find terrorism insurance in the wake of Sept. 11 might get off the ground with Congress agreeing to back the insurance.\nDuring its last day in session for the year, the U.S. House of Representatives approved the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, a bill that calls for the government to step in and cover 90 percent of losses stemming from an act of terrorism that causes more than $10 billion in claims.\n\"This bill is absolutely necessary to the well-being of the American economy,\" House Financial Services Committee Chairman Michael G. Oxley, an Ohio Republican, told reporters after the vote. \"We need this backstop now.\"\nTerrorism insurance charged into the national spotlight after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks that caused an estimated $70 billion worth of claims, destroying the reinsurance market and making it nearly impossible for some developers to get coverage.\n\"The reality is no one is offering terrorism insurance in Maryland,\" Debbie McKerrow, a spokeswoman for the Maryland Insurance Administration, said earlier this year after the administration approved 270 requests from insurance providers looking to drop their terrorism insurance.\nAs the insurance market dried up, lending institutions tightened purse strings. It all meant down time for developers and an estimated 300,000 jobs were halted indefinitely.\nAccording to the Real Estate Roundtable, a Washington-based industry advocate, $15.5 billion worth of commercial projects in 17 states were put on hold. The results came from a survey of its members.\n\"The one-year anniversary of Sept. 11 has come and gone and thousands of U.S. business owners are still finding themselves uninsured or underinsured against potentially catastrophic economic losses from future terrorist attacks,\" said Roundtable President and COO Jeffrey D. DeBoer. \"We need a federal backstop on terrorism insurance to protect our nation's economic security, and we need it now.\"\nDeBoer's request appears to have been answered. Senate leadership vowed to move on a companion bill to the House-passed act. Both houses of Congress had passed versions of the bill earlier this year, but no compromise on its terms was reached until after the elections made it clear that Republicans would control Congress next session.\nBut the compromised bill might not be the godsend it was once hoped to be.\nIt only covers claims that exceed $10 billion, and, at the time this article went to press, it was unclear whether bioterrorism or chemical attacks would be covered.\nFor the national real estate community, the coverage is a paramount issue. And although local real estate professionals supported the bill, Baltimore is not as high a risk as some \"tier one cities with trophy buildings, like Chicago and the Sears Tower,\" said Building Owners and Managers Association Baltimore President Peter Stanford, a principal at Colliers Pinkard.\n\"We do feel this is an important issue, but obviously not as critical as some of the tier one cities,\" he said. \"We still have a legitimate [central business district] with tall buildings that are a high risk, like the Legg Mason tower, 100 E. Pratt St., and the World Trade Center.\"\nThe risk extends into Baltimore's suburbs as well, where a strong defense-related presence might raise the concern of insurance underwriters.\n\"A generic suburban office product is less risky, but if someone like [Corporate Office Properties Trust] has a nice office park next to the [National Security Administration], you have to think that some insurance carriers are going to say 'You guys could be problems just because of your neighbors,'\" Stanford said.\nAll that could boil down to a less attractive acquisition market in Central Maryland. A lack of coverage, or coverage rife with holes, could be a turnoff for potential buyers and their investors.\n\"The longer term benefits of this act is on the disposition of properties. If there is no comprehensive insurance available, transferring commercial real estate could get very tough. That's the hidden jewel of this bill: preserving the ability to have a viable disposition market,\" Stanford said.\nThe only question remaining is if whether the Congressional act will spur carriers to make terrorism insurance less costly and more comprehensive.\n\nLoad-Date: November 24, 2002"
