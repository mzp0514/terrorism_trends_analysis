    "full text": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Il pledged to keep a moratorium on missile tests until 2003, but said there would be no inter-Korean summit as long as Washington is reviewing its policy on the North, a European delegation said Thursday.\nThe promise to adhere to a moratorium that began in September 1999 was an advance in a process that has stalled amid U.S.-North Korean tension.\nWhile Kim feted European Union head Goeran Persson and his entourage with toasts, his government was reacting furiously to the release this week of a U.S. State Department report that again listed North Korea as a sponsor of terrorism.\n\"Washington had better mind its own business,\" KCNA, the North's foreign news outlet, said in a commentary that characterized U.S. airstrikes on Iraq as an example of terrorism.\nIt said the United States would be \"well advised\" to wash \"its own terrorists' hands stained with blood â€¦ before taking issue with others.\"\nThe mood was more cordial during five hours of talks between Kim and Persson, the Swedish prime minister who traveled to one of the world's most secretive countries to try to energize efforts to end the decades-old enmity on the Korean peninsula.\n\"Kim Jong Il said that the moratorium on testing would last until 2003,\" said Persson, the first Western European leader to visit the totalitarian North. After that, he said, the North \"would wait and see.\"\n\"My firm impression is that the North wants a new summit,\" said Persson, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency. \"But they are careful about the timing today and that is because of the policy review in the U.S.\"\n\nLoad-Date: May 4, 2001"
