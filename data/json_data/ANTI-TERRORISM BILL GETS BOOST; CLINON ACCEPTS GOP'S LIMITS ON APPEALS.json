    "full text": "Anti-terrorism legislation inched toward a Senate vote after President Bill Clinton reversed his position and accepted the GOP goal of including in the bill limits on appeals by death row inmates.\nThe Senate had planned to vote on the full bill Tuesday night, but it scheduled a vote for this morning on ending the debate.\nClinton's move was his second conciliatory gesture this week regarding the legislation, which was inspired by the Oklahoma City bombing on April 19. Earlier, he had urged both Democrats and Republicans to \"curb politics\" and stop trying to amend the legislation.\nBut the accommodating words from Clinton were not enough to prevent an outbreak of partisan hubris on the Senate floor and a renewed threat by Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., to withdraw the legislation unless Democrats cut back their proposed amendments further.\n\"We're not going to continue this game,\" said Dole, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination. \"The time is running out for this bill to be on the floor, make no mistake about it.\"\nNoting that the Democrats had proposed several amendments related to gun laws, Dole said: \"It's an effort by Democrats to bring up all the gun amendments they've been keeping in their closet. . . . I think it's time for them to start supporting their president. They ought to get behind President Clinton on this bill.\"\nSenate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., retorted: \"We care just as deeply as anybody else about what happened in Oklahoma City. . . . We will stay in all night long if we have to, to do it.\"\nIf Dole withdrew the measure, Daschle said, the Democrats would append it to the coming telecommunications bill and \"every other bill\" in coming weeks.\nDaschle said the Democrats still had 15 or 16 proposed amendments as of Tuesday afternoon, down from more than 60 when senators returned from their weeklong recess Monday morning. Democrats pared their original list down to about 20.\nThe House has yet to schedule hearings or a vote on its version of the bill, but Republican leaders have pledged floor action by the end of the month.\nAs recently as May 25, Clinton told Dole that he did not want to address limits on death penalty appeals in the anti-terrorism bill. Although he supported revisions that would ensure swifter resolution of capital cases, Clinton said, he preferred to deal with it in separate legislation.\nBut Monday night, Clinton said in a CNN interview with Larry King that the issue should be included in the bill \"so that it would apply to any prosecutions brought against anyone indicted in Oklahoma.\"\n\"We need to cut the time delay on the appeals dramatically . . .,\" he said. \"It ought to be done in the context of this terrorism legislation so that it would apply to any prosecutions brought against anyone indicted in Oklahoma. And I think it ought to be done.\"\nOne of the Democrats' gun-related amendments, offered by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., was adopted by voice vote Tuesday. The provision would increase the statute of limitations on certain gun crimes - including making fully automatic machine guns, possessing sawed-off shotguns and making homemade silencers or bombs - to five years from three.\nBoxer said her amendment was supported by 46 police chiefs, including Oklahoma City's. \"It would give prosecutors a badly needed tool,\" she said. \"More time.\"\nThe overall bill, written by Dole and Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, encompasses many of the proposals that Clinton put in the $ 1.5 billion anti-terrorism package he submitted to Congress a week after the bombing. But it does not give law enforcement as much authority for electronic surveillance as Clinton's plan.\nRepublicans and civil libertarians alike have criticized Clinton's proposals, saying they could erode constitutional protections.\nThe Senate bill would authorize the hiring of 1,000 new federal law enforcement personnel, increase federal penalties for terrorist crimes as well as conspiracies involving explosives, establish streamlined procedures for deporting aliens believed to be terrorists, give the FBI access to credit reports and telephone records in foreign terrorism cases and ban U.S. aid to countries that assist terrorist nations.\n\nLoad-Date: June 8, 1995"
