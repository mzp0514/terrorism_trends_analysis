    "full text": "\"Progressives\" have been making much hay about America's rising poverty rate. Odd, but we don't seem to hear much from this crowd about how it has increased despite the government spending $16 trillion to supposedly eradicate it. Wonder if \"progressives\" will ever link the two? Nah, they don't have the capacity. ... Those same \"progressives\" will blame \"spending cuts\" for increasing poverty levels. Odd, but the Congressional Budget Office says in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, overall spending increased 4.2 percent, paced by a 16.7 percent increase in interest costs -- to cover all that deficit spending. ... That thousand-for-one prisoner swap between Israel and Hamas returned more than a few terrorist killers to the fray. Odd, but the New York Post is forced to recount the words of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in \"Fighting Terrorism,\" his 1995 book: \"Prisoner releases only embolden terrorists. ... Worse, by leading terrorists to think such demands are likely to be met, they encourage precisely the terrorist blackmail they are supposed to defuse.\" ... Pennsylvania's casinos are reporting record takes. Odd, but we wonder if anybody has bothered to explore if that means gamblers are recording record losses. \n\nLoad-Date: October 20, 2011"
