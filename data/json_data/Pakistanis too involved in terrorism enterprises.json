    "full text": "In last week's U.S. missile strikes on the terrorist camps in Afghanistan, many Pakistanis were killed.\nThis was proof that Pakistan is actively involved in arming, training and sustaining terrorists.\nMost of these were terrorists who operated in Indian Kashmir. This particular Pakistani terrorist group - Harkat ul Mujahideen - has now vowed revenge on America and the Jews.\nPakistan has consistently supported a reign of death and terror in Indian Kashmir for the past decades. The violent public reaction in Pakistan against the latest U.S. strikes aimed at Islamic terrorists is an indication of the reality. The extremist Taliban government of Afghanistan is solely dependent on Pakistan.\nThe fact is that Pakistan has been using U.S. and other aid to further its Islamic agenda. The nuclear status of Pakistan lends a dangerous dimension to the Islamic terrorist scenario.\nRamzi Yusuf - the World Trade Center bomber - was from Pakistan.\nMir Aimal Kansi - the killer of two CIA employees - was from Pakistan.\nNot long ago four U.S. Embassy employees were gunned down in Pakistan.\nThe first Kenya Embassy bombing suspect was arrested in Pakistan.\nThe plot to murder the pope while he was visiting Philippines a few years back was hatched in Pakistan.\nPakistan has been secretly buying North Korean military technology, thus sustaining the outlaw regime of North Korea.\nPakistan supports, controls and directs the policies of the radical Islamic Afghan government, which is a breeding ground of terrorists.\nWhat's more, Pakistan in collusion with China has completely undermined the nuclear nonproliferation regime by obtaining the banned technology from China.\nIf terrorism is to be eliminated, Pakistan needs to be effectively checked.\nMohana Kher\nBloomington\n\nLoad-Date: August 31, 1998"
