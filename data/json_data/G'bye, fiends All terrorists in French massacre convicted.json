    "full text": "All 14 defendants charged in the terrorist attacks against French newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a Paris kosher store were found guilty Wednesday, nearly six years after the massacres left 17 people dead and shocked the world.\nThree of the defendants were tried in absentia, including the fugitive widow of ISIS gunman Amédy Coulibaly, who was killed at the end of a hostage crisis inside a Jewish supermarket - two days after gunmen stormed the headquarters of Charlie Hebdo, a satirical publication that has long angered religious extremists.\nISIS and Al Qaeda jointly claimed responsibility shortly after the attacks in early January 2015.\nThe 11 men who were present at the three-month trial received sentences ranging from four to 30 years in prison.\nTwo defendants who helped Coulibaly's widow, Hayat Boumeddiene, flee to Syria after the attack are believed to be dead but were sentenced to life in prison just in case. Boumeddiene (inset) is thought to still be alive.\nThe verdict ends a tense court proceeding marked by new terror attacks and a wave of COVID-19 infections among the defendants. It also ends a painful chapter in France as the country tries to recover from the horrific attacks.\nThe bloodshed in 2015 began during an editorial staff meeting at Charlie Hebdo's offices, where brothers Chérif and Saïd Kouachi opened fire in an act of revenge for the paper's cartoon portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad.\nOne of the survivors, cartoonist Corinne Rey, took the witness stand at the trial and recalled how she watched the pair kill 12 of her colleagues.\n\"I was not killed, but what happened to me was absolutely chilling, and I will live with it until my life is over,\" she told the special terrorism court.\nAs a manhunt was underway in the city over the next few days, Coulibaly fatally shot a police officer and then stormed a Jewish store armed with explosives, pistols and an assault rifle.\n\"You are Jews and French, the two things I hate the most,\" Coulibaly said as he took the terrified customers hostages before killing four of them.\nCoulibaly and the Kouachi brothers were ultimately cornered and shot dead by police.\nIslamic extremists terrorized France again as the trial got underway this fall.\nIn late September, a radicalized Pakistani man wounded two people with a butcher's knife just outside the former Charlie Hebdo headquarters. Weeks later, a Chechen refugee beheaded a French teacher who had shown caricatures of Muhammad to his students.\nOn Oct. 30, a knife-wielding Tunisian man carrying a copy of the Koran and shouting \"Allahu akbar\" - God is great - attacked worshipers in a church in Nice, killing three, including a woman who was decapitated.\nWednesday's verdicts closed one chapter of terror.\n\"This is the end of a trial that's been crazy, illuminating, painful but which has been useful,\" said Richard Malka, a lawyer for Charlie Hebdo.\n\nLoad-Date: December 17, 2020"
