    "full text": "World leaders began signing a global treaty yesterday making it a crime to possess radioactive material or weapons with the intention of committing a terrorist act or to damage a nuclear facility.\nThe Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism was the 13th antiterrorism treaty to be adopted by the General Assembly but the first since the Sept. 11 terror attacks on the United States.\nRussian President Vladimir V. Putin, whose country sponsored the seven-year effort leading to the treaty's adoption by consensus in April, was the first leader to sign the document yesterday morning at a desk in a makeshift hall on the sidelines of the U.N. summit.\nPresident Bush signed next, followed by French Premier Dominique de Villepin, as the first of more than 50 leaders who were expected to sign by the end of today. The treaty must be ratified by 22 countries to take effect.\nCanadian Prime Minister Paul Martin, who was the fourth to sign, said it was important that the document be followed quickly by a broad treaty covering all aspects of terrorism - an effort that has been blocked for years by disagreements over defining terrorism and other concerns.\n\"With the other signatories we have taken an important step forward in reducing the risk of nuclear terrorism,\" Martin said. \"That being said, if we are to make the world a safer place, clearly we need a more comprehensive approach to disarmament and proliferation, and we must get on with it.\"\n\nLoad-Date: September 22, 2005"
