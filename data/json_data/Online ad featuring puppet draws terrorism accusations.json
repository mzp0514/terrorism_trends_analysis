    "full text": "CAIRO - Prosecutors have questioned officials in one of Egypt's largest telecommunications companies over an online advertisement featuring a puppet, which a controversial blogger has accused of delivering a coded message linked to the Muslim Brotherhood group, the company said Wednesday.\nThe accusations made against Vodafone Egypt's ad starring well-known puppet Abla Fahita come shortly after the government designated the Brotherhood a terrorist organization. The government accused the Brotherhood of orchestrating a series of attacks by Sinai militants, but has provided little evidence to prove the connection. The Brotherhood denies the accusations.\nAhmed \"Spider,\" a self-style youth activist known as a strong supporter of ousted President Hosni Mubarak, says code about an upcoming attack is included in the details of the puppet ad.\nFahita and her daughter Karkoura search for her deceased husband's sim card, while explaining to her friend over the phone about another character \"Mama Touta.\" In the background, a radio anchor explains how to make \"stuffed turkey\" for Christmas while sitting next to a cactus from which ball ornaments were dangling. She says she asked the building guards to get a sniffer dog of a shopping mall to search for missing things and gets money in return.\nSpider explained the alleged code on the Al-Tahrir network on Tuesday night: The mall and the dog refer to the planned site of the attack, and \"Mama Touta\" is the Brotherhood's secret name.\nA statement by Vodafone described the accusations as \"irrational.\"\n\nLoad-Date: January 2, 2014"
