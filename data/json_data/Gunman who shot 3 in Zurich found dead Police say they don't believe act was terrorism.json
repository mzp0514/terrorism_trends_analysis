They said that he had no known links to terrorist groups, but that he was already wanted for the fatal stabbing of a friend whose body was found Sunday at a playground in Zurich.\n\"We don't believe it was a terror act,\" Christiane Lentjes Meili, the chief of police for the canton of Zurich, said of the attack Monday. \"We have no evidence of a connection to terrorism.\"\nThree men were wounded in the attack, two of them seriously; all are in stable condition.\nThe attack occurred around 5 p.m. at a prayer center used mostly by Somali and Eritrean refugees, just south of the city's main train station. Hours after the attack, the police found the body of a man on the Gessner Bridge, near the city center and a short walk from the Islamic center.\nWitnesses to the attack reported that the gunman, dressed in dark clothes and a woolen cap, had escaped on foot. The police in Zurich, the largest city in Switzerland, used tracker-dog units to hunt the gunman.\nOn Tuesday morning, Peat Jost, a spokesman for the Zurich police, confirmed in a phone interview that the gunman was the man whose body had been found.\n\"Our investigation says the dead man is the shooter,\" he said.\n\nLoad-Date: December 21, 2016"
