Admission for the seminar is $5 for the general public; $1 for students with school ID; and $2 for students without school ID.\nThese students say they are tired of being referred to as the bad students of Dubuque.\n\"Central (Alternative High School) opens doors instead of shutting them,\" said student Ronnie Sanders.\nSanders, along with his classmates at Central, will open the doors to the world of global terrorism when they welcome three guest speakers to Dubuque for a seminar.\nThe students' project will culminate in the seminar that will begin at 7 p.m. Wednesday, April 23, at the Best Western Midway Hotel in Dubuque.\nRandall Laughead, an FBI intelligence analyst; Werner Hellmer, an attorney; and Todd Sharkey, a recruiter for the 133rd Iowa Army National Guard, will discuss global terrorism during the seminar.\nThe students in teacher John Adelmann's history class have worked together and researched specific issues on the sometimes-controversial topic of global terrorism.\n\"In a sense, they become experts in the area,\" Adelmann said. \"This has almost become part of who they are.\"\nThe students have spent countless hours of research and have conducted numerous interviews about their global-terrorism topic. They will combine their individual work to create a book that will be sold during the seminar.\n\"They're using their text, and we're writing them,\" said student Jacob Ginter about the difference between other history classes and Central's class.\nThroughout the process, Adelmann has teamed up with teacher Tim Ebeling and paraprofessional Carol Cross.\n\"I waited my whole life for a school like Central,\" said student Tonya Davis-Goesse. \"The staff here at Central think the way they wish they could be.\"\nDavis-Goesse partnered with Sanders to give presentations about their global terrorism topic at local clubs and organizations. The speeches helped Davis-Goesse prepare for Wednesday night, when she will be the master of ceremonies.\nThe process of researching, interviewing, drafting and compiling a book about global terrorism for one of their classes has instilled a sense of pride in these students.\n\"It proves that Central is not a school for bad students,\" said student Shanethra Stephenson. \"It gives students a chance.\"\n\nLoad-Date: April 19, 2008"
