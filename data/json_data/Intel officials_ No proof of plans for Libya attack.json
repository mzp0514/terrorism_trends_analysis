    "full text": "WASHINGTON -- U.S. intelligence officials said on Friday that no evidence has surfaced to indicate that the Sept. 11 assault on an American diplomatic outpost in Libya was planned in advance, a conclusion that suggests the attack was spontaneous even if it involved militants with ties to al-Qaida. \nThe description represents the latest shift in the government's evolving account of an attack that claimed the life of the U.S. ambassador to Libya, as well as three other Americans, and has become entangled in the politics of the presidential campaign. \n\"There isn't any intelligence that the attackers pre-planned their assault days or weeks in advance,\" an intelligence official said. \"The bulk of available information supports the early assessment that the attackers launched their assault opportunistically after they learned about the violence at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo.\" \nThat emerging consensus among analysts at the CIA and other agencies could lend new support to the Obama administration, which has struggled to fend off Republican allegations that it has been reluctant to admit that the attack in Benghazi was an act of terrorism. \nThe latest assessment indicates that the timing of the attack in Benghazi was triggered by protests, but supports subsequent accounts by Obama administration officials describing the siege as a terrorist assault. \nThe violence in Benghazi appears to have involved militants with ties to al-Qaida in North Africa, but no evidence indicates that it was organized by al-Qaida, or timed to coincide with the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States, officials said. \n\nLoad-Date: October 29, 2012"
