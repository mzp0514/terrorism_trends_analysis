    "full text": "ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia -- Defendants in one of the world's most widely followed press-freedom cases were acquitted of terrorism charges on Friday.\nNine bloggers and journalists, most of them contributors to Zone 9, a blog critical of the government, were arrested in April 2014 and charged under Ethiopia's sweeping antiterrorism law. Another was abroad and charged in absentia. \n  The case became a rallying point for critics of Ethiopia's government, which has been accused of stifling free speech.\n  Five defendants were unexpectedly released in July. On Friday, judges in a court in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, decided that for those still imprisoned, ''the documents presented by the prosecutor were not sufficient to prove the alleged terrorism,'' said Ameha Mekonnen, a defense lawyer in the case.\n  One defendant remains on trial under separate charges of provoking violence.\n  Press freedom advocates welcomed the news. ''We are elated that the terrorism charges against the Zone 9 bloggers are dropped,'' Tom Rhodes, the East Africa representative of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said in a statement. He urged the authorities to abandon its prosecution of the remaining defendant.\n  ''Ethiopia should be listening to critical voices to strengthen democracy and development, not jailing them,'' Mr. Rhodes said.\n  This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.         \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/17/world/africa/ethiopia-zone-9-defendants.html\n\nLoad-Date: October 17, 2015"
