    "full text": "Muslim nations' role in refugee crisis?\nThe refugee situation in Europe is a tragic crisis that requires both reactive responses to assist refugees and proactive planning to try to prevent future crises.\nThus, I pose the following questions.\nWhat are Muslim countries, particularly wealthier Gulf States, doing to assist and accept refugees from Syria and other Muslim countries?\nWhat are the long term and short term economic, social and cultural costs — for both receiving people and the refugees themselves — of migration, particularly when refugees move to nations with a culture that is very different from their own?\nWhat are Muslim religious leaders doing to educate fellow Muslims and sanction those who distort Islam in order to perpetrate terrorism thereby causing an increase of people fleeing their homelands?\nWhat are Internet service providers doing to shut down websites that promote hatred and seek to recruit terrorists?\nWhat are arms dealers and nations doing to prevent the sale and or transfer of weapons to state and nonstate terrorists?\nInstability and terrorism, both state-sponsored and by nonstate actors, are complex problems that require all political and religious leaders to cooperate and contribute to solutions that address both immediate needs and long term issues.\nKim Freitag\nElgin\n\nLoad-Date: September 14, 2015"
