    "full text": "WASHINGTON-As expected, the Treasury Department's conclusion that the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act should be not be extended in its present form drew a mixed response on Capitol Hill.\nAlthough the initial enactment of TRIA was a bipartisan effort, and although as recently as last September, the House Financial Services Committee unanimously passed a bill that would have extended TRIA through the end of 2007, reactions to Treasury's report broke on party lines.\nIn fact, Financial Services Committee Chairman Mike Oxley, R-Ohio, issued a statement praising the report, saying ``a simple extension of the program is not in the best interests of American consumers or the economy.'' After calling for greater private sector involvement and narrowed federal involvement, he added, ``I am confident that we can achieve a comprehensive, fiscally responsible solution to deal with terrorism insurance by the end of this year.''\nBut Democratic members of the committee made public a letter they sent to Rep. Oxley. They disagreed with Treasury's call for a narrower program and instead called for expanding TRIA's backstop to include group life insurance. In fact, they called on the chairman to ``schedule a hearing and markup on H.R. 1153, which we sponsored, as soon as possible.'' H.R. 1153 would extend an expanded TRIA through the end of 2007.\nEnactment of the measure, however, is a long shot at best. It has only one Republican co-sponsor.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nArt Credit: Rep.
