U.S. health officials said there was no evidence of terrorism but promised \"a very intense investigation.\"\n\"There's no need for people to fear they are at risk, whether in Florida or North Carolina or elsewhere,\" said Dr. Jeffrey P. Koplan, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. \"There is absolutely no need for panic.\"\nThe unidentified, 63-year-old Lantana, Fla., man checked into a Lake Worth hospital on Tuesday after a visit to North Carolina and was reported to be gravely ill.\nAnthrax has been developed by some countries as a possible biological weapon. But the disease can be contracted naturally; the bacterial spores can be found in soil and are often carried by livestock. Officials said the Florida victim is an avid outdoorsman.\nThe most recent previous U.S. case of anthrax was earlier this year in Texas. But that case was the skin form of the disease, not inhalation anthrax, an especially lethal and rare form in which the disease settles in the lungs.\n\"We will develop a very intense investigation of this case,\" Koplan said. \"We are in a period of heightened risk and concern in this country. It's our responsibility to make sure people know what is going on and we control it as quickly as possible.\"\nKoplin said CDC investigators had been dispatched to both Florida and North Carolina. The FBI also is investigating.\nInhalation anthrax, which results from breathing the spores, is exceptionally rare. The last reported U.S. case was in 1976.\n\nLoad-Date: October 5, 2001"
