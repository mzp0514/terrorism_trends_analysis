    "full text": "The changing face of terrorism was made plain Friday in Tanzania\nand Kenya, and it looks like this: Bigger, more malevolent, more\ncruel than before. Given that the terrorist wars can never be\nwon outright, the news out of Africa is a powerful reminder that\nthe heights of terrorism are rising fast.\nNot long ago, terrorism was predominantly a weapon of groups with\nproclaimed political goals. And to promote their agenda, they\navoided excess collateral damage, to borrow one of modern warfare's\nmore horrible terms of art. When Palestinians attacked the Olympics\nin 1972, their victims were Israelis. When bombers killed 241\nAmericans in a barracks in Lebanon in 1983, the scale was bigger,\nbut the victims were still politically relevant.\nNot so in Africa. In Dar es Salaam and Nairobi, the United States\nwas the target. But relatively few Americans died, while hundreds\nof Africans were killed. To a degree rarely seen before, the killers\ndemonstrated a total disregard for third-party victims.\nBigger bombs and less discriminate targeting: You can imagine\nwhere this leads. The killers in Africa were doubtless operating\nthrough a sophisticated transnational organization, perhaps with\nthe sponsorship of a terrorist state, which may or may not be\ninclined to share technology or weapons of mass destruction. Add\nto that the willingness to attack general populations, and the\nstage is set for a truly national or even global catastrophe.\nThere have been hints of this future before. The bombing of the\nWorld Trade towers in New York showed a willingness to kill thousands.\nAttempts to release nerve gas in Tokyo's subway showed a willingness\nto use chemical weaponry. As political terrorism is subsumed by\nreligious radicalism, the chances someone will use such a weapon\nimprove. If paradise depends on a body count, nothing prevents\na fanatic from pulling the trigger.\nThat argues for keeping the technology under control to begin\nwith, through treaties and other tools. And it suggests, where\npossible, improving our record of preventing terrorism and bringing\nterrorists to justice.\nBy Sunday, Washington was awash with promises to prosecute Friday's\nbombers. But even if justice can be obtained, the terrorist bar\nhas been raised another malevolent notch. What can prevent that\nrising standard from jumping another rung? There's no answer yet,\nnot in Africa nor any place else.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO, B/W, , Khalil Senosi, AP\n\nLoad-Date: August 10, 1998"
