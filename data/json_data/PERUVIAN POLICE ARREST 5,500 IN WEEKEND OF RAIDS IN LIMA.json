The operation was carried out under a state of national emergency declared by President Fernando Belaunde Terry after stepped-up guerrilla attacks in central Peru and the Lima area.\n \nPrepare for Independence Day\nThe civil guard said the mass arrests were ''to clear away criminal and terrorist elements'' in preparation for July 28 Independence Day crowds.\nThe Government last week canceled the traditional parade of an estimated 6.2 million students across the nation to mark Peru's independence from Spain in 1821.\nBut in Ayacucho, the state capital 350 miles southeast of Lima, where the guerrilla fight is centered and where Mr. Belaunde Terry sent 4,000 soldiers and policemen to fight the rebels, school officials said students would parade as usual.\nThe police in Ayacucho said the guerrillas cut power in the city of 80,000 for 45 minutes Saturday night by dynamiting a power substation. The police said more than 200 people without documentation were arrested in Ayacucho over the weekend."
