    "full text": "KABUL, Afghanistan - The United States envoy negotiating with the Taliban for an end to nearly 18 years of fighting in Afghanistan was departing Tuesday for Qatar to resume talks, the State Department said, amid concerns about a growing threat by an Islamic State affiliate.\nZalmay Khalilzad also will visit with the Afghan government, which has been sidelined from the talks, to discuss the \"peace process and encourage full preparation for intra-Afghan negotiations,\" the U.S. said.\nIn Washington, President Donald Trump told reporters he believes the Taliban insurgents are eager to stop fighting and that they could \"very easily\" prevent Afghanistan from being a breeding ground for terrorism. The U.S. will, nonetheless, keep a close eye on Taliban influence, he said, even as it thins its troop presence.\n\"That's what we have to watch. And we'll always have intelligence, and we'll always have somebody there,\" Trump said.\nThe new talks in Qatar, where the insurgent group has a political office, come after a horrific suicide bombing at a wedding in Kabul that killed more than 63 over the weekend. The blast, claimed by an IS affiliate, led outraged Afghans to question whether a U.S.-Taliban deal would mean peace for long-suffering civilians.\n\nLoad-Date: August 21, 2019"
