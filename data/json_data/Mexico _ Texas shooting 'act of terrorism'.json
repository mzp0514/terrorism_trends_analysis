Just minutes before the rampage, U.S. investigators believe, the shooter posted a rambling online manifesto in which he railed against a perceived \"invasion\" of Hispanics coming into the U.S. He then allegedly targeted a shopping area in El Paso that is about 5 miles from the main border checkpoint with Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.\n\nLoad-Date: September 10, 2019"
