    "full text": "Japan arrested on Saturday four fugitives expelled from the Middle East and vowed to keep up pressure on an elusive comrade of the terrorist Japanese Red Army who stayed behind.\nThe four were deported from Lebanon after serving 3-year prison terms fo r illegally entering that country.\nPolice said they were taken into custody at Tokyo's main international airport less than an hour after they arrived.\nJapan has long wanted to try the fugitives on charges stemming from bloody attacks around the world, including a shooting at Israel's Ben Gurion airport in 1972 in which 24 people were killed.\nThe Red Army members are considered heroes by many in Lebanon and the Arab world for championing the Palestinian cause and opposing Israel, which occupies a border zone in southern Lebanon.\n\"It is significant they are now in the hands of our country's legal system,\" Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was quoted by Kyodo News agency as saying in a statement. \"It's a good example to show there is no place in the world where terrorists can enjoy a peaceful life.\"\nAfter refusing to extradite them, Lebanon deported the four Friday on to Jordan, diplomats in Amman said. Masao Adachi, 59, Haruo Wako, 50, Kazuo Tohira, 46, and the only woman, Mariko Yamamoto, 58, were handed over to Japanese diplomats for escort back to Japan.\nKozo Okamoto, who participated in the attack in Israel, remained at large. The Lebanese government granted him asylum, saying he still suffered \"from physical and psychological injuries sustained while in Israeli prisons.\"\n\nLoad-Date: March 19, 2000"
