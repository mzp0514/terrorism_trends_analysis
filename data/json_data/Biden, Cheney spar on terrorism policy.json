    "full text": "WASHINGTON - Ping-ponging across the airwaves, Vice President Joe Biden and his predecessor, Dick Cheney, bickered on the Sunday TV talk shows over terror trials and interrogations, credit for success in Iraq and the long-running effort to contain Iran's nuclear program.\nBiden called Cheney \"misinformed or he is misinforming\" on current national security strategies. Cheney said President Obama wasn't taking the al-Qaida threat seriously. But, in a marked change of tone, the former vice president acknowledged that the Bush White House struggled with how to bring suspected terrorists to justice.\nOn NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Biden struck first, declaring that Cheney's attacks on Obama's commitment to fighting terrorism ignored the facts.\n\"We've eliminated 12 of their top 20 people. We have taken out 100 of their associates,\" said Biden. \"They are in fact not able to do anything remotely like they were in the past. They are on the run. I don't know where Dick Cheney has been. Look, it's one thing, again, to criticize. It's another thing to sort of rewrite history. What is he talking about?\"\nCheney did not answer directly, instead insisting that Biden was \"dead wrong\" to assert that a fresh Sept. 11-style strike was unlikely, calling a nuclear or biological attack by al-Qaida \"the biggest strategic threat the United States faces today.\"\n- The Associated Press\n\nLoad-Date: February 16, 2010"
