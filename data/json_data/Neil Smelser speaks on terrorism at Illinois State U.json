His scholarship has had a significant and defining impact on many areas of our discipline, more recently, the study of terrorism,\" Nick Maroules, chair of the Department of Sociology & Anthropology, said.\nThe College of Arts and Sciences along with the Department of Sociology and Anthropology hosted a lecture concerning terrorism by Smelser. The lecture was titled \"Why Are Terrorists Beliefs So Powerful?\"\nSmelser has been a visiting professor of sociology at Illinois State University this semester.\nHe is currently teaching a graduate seminar and an upper division undergraduate course.\n\"He has recently published two books on the subject, and I asked him if he would be willing to give a public lecture on the topic, and he agreed,\" Maroules said.\n\"Terrorism is a universal ideology,\" Smelser said.\nAccording to Smelser there are several ideologies that influence a terrorist's thinking. These ideologies included cultural mysticism, diagnosis, assignment of agency, vision and strain and consistency.\n\"[These ideologies] suggest and demonstrate belief systems. They constitute such powerful ingredients which derive influence,\" Smelser said.\nSmelser explained how each ideology contributed to some common beliefs of terrorists.\n\"Ideology of diagnosis identifies what is wrong with the world,\" he said.\nHe used as an example the Ku Klux Klan and Nazis and added that groups similar to these will not accept any other explanation of what is wrong with the world except other people not like themselves.\n\"Ideology of assignment of agency has the tendency to target one set of people who have a long history of antagonist belief systems,\" Smelser said.\nAlso, according to Smelser, with the assignment of agency there are three tendencies. These tendencies include converting the negative stereotype of a group into the absolute enemy and assimilating that most nearby people are the enemies.\nHe said these tendencies are used as justification to unjust treatment toward a group.\n\"If the group is seen as a less than human agent, then this will justify inhumane treatment,\" Smelser said.\nAs the lecture came to an end, he addressed the ideology of strain and consistency.\n\"The ideology of strain and consistency vows that things fit together,\" Smelser said.\nAfter he was done with his presentation a short question and answer session continued.\nSmelser has served as a member of the Committee on Science and Technology to Counter Terrorism for the National Research Council, and he has chaired the panel on Understanding Terrorists to Deter Terrorism for the NRC.\n\"We are incredibly fortunate to have someone of his stature with us for a semester,\" Maroules said.\nGary Olsen, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, said he was pleased with the turnout.\n\"I am thrilled to see such a large turnout,\" he said.\n(C) 2006 The Daily Vidette via U-WIRE\n\nLoad-Date: April 5, 2006"
