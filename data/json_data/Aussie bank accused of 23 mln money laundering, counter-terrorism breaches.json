The 93-year-old woman, during a conversation with The Daily Mail , said she didn't like that program too much.\nAUSTRAC chief executiveNicole Rose said Westpac had engaged in \"serious and systemic non-compliance\".\nWestpac said it was reviewing AUSTRAC's claim, adding it had informed the regulator of its failure to report the payments.\nHartzer said he accepted most of the regulator's assertions but \"at a senior executive level, for the board, for me personally, in no way have we been indifferent on this\".\nThe Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), an Australian government financial intelligence agency set up to monitor financial transactions to identify money laundering, organised crime, tax evasion, welfare fraud and terrorism, alleges Westpac Banking Corp failed to report more than 19.5 million global funds transfer instructions it received over a period of five years.\nThe dirty money watchdog alleges almost 3,000 transactions indicative of child exploitation payments - totalling about $480,000 - were made by 12 Westpac customers.\nFourth-ranked lender Australia and New Zealand Banking Group declined to comment on whether it was under investigation by AUSTRAC, while National Australia Bank, the third-largest, was not immediately available for comment.\nASB Bank's Australian parent, the Commonwealth Bank, was fined $AU700,000 a few years ago for similar anti-money laundering breaches.\nThe country's banking sector has also been the subject of a royal commission - Australia's highest form of public inquiry - that earlier this year exposed widespread wrongdoing in the industry.\n\nLoad-Date: November 23, 2019"
