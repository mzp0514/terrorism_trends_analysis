Roosevelt was in the White House.\nTwo thousand two closed with the Dow Jones industrial average down 16.8 percent for the year and 27.5 percent since Dec. 31, 1999. Analysts said a slide in the last days of December showed that investors, demoralized by three years of losses, were not willing to make major bets on a turnaround in the new year.\n\"It's been a terrible year, particularly on top of 2000 and 2001 being down years,\" said Mike Kayes, chief investment officer at Eastover Capital in Charlotte, N.C.\nThe Dow rose 8.78, or 0.1 percent, yesterday to close at 8,341.63. The broader market finished mixed. The Nasdaq composite index fell 4.03, or 0.3 percent, to 1,335.51. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.43, or 0.1 percent, to 879.82.\nBoth the Dow and the S&P suffered their first three-year declines since 1939-1941, and the Nasdaq posted its first three-year loss since the exchange's inception in 1971.\nA disappointing report on consumer confidence yesterday further dampened the buying enthusiasm typically seen at year's end.\nThe Conference Board said its consumer confidence index dropped to 80.3 in December from a revised 84.9 in November, offering a disappointing outlook for consumer spending. Analysts had expected a December reading of 88.0.\nWall Street historically has seen strong gains during the last two weeks of December on hopes of better prospects for the new year. But investors have shied away from major stock commitments on worries that rising oil prices and tensions with Iraq and North Korea would stall the economic recovery.\nIndeed, the Nasdaq finished its worst December ever, with a 9.7 percent drop, while the Dow and S&P 500 had their poorest December since 1931, with declines of 6.2 percent for the Dow and 6 percent for the S&P 500.\nFor 2002, the Dow dropped 16.8 percent, the Nasdaq dropped about 31.5 percent, and the S&P declined 23.4 percent.\n\"Investors are closing this year in much of the same mood they endured the last 12 months, one of discouragement and concern about factors that are way beyond our control,\" said Charles G. Crane, strategist for Victory SBSF Capital Management.\nKayes, the Eastover Capital chief investment officer, said: \"Investors have been hurt by the combination of accounting scandals, the lingering effects of the war on terrorism, and the lack of market leadership. It just takes a long time for things to unravel after the really historic bull market run of the 1990s.\"\nIt was not supposed to be this way. Investors began 2002 with optimism, hoping the economy could rebuild after the Sept. 11 attacks. But then accounting scandals at companies ranging from Enron to WorldCom to ImClone left investors distrustful.\nWorries about a war with Iraq and, more recently, tensions with North Korea also weighed heavily on the market, negating much of the October-November rally. The concerns also dashed hopes of a traditional year-end rally.\nStill, analysts cautioned against drawing too many conclusions from recent declines, explaining that volume has been weak because of the holidays.\nThey also urged investors to keep the losses of 2002 in perspective.\n\"Real money has been lost in the stocks, and that is not a good thing,\" Crane said. \"On the other hand, if we pull the camera back and look at the balance sheets in total, value has been created in real estate, and bond portfolios have experienced gains.\"\nGainers yesterday included Tyco, which rose $1.73 to $17.08 after the diversified company said its former managers pushed the limits of accounting regulations to inflate profits, but did not break the rules.\nHoneywell climbed $1.53 to $24, while IBM gained $1.25 to $77.50.\nConsolidated volume on the New York Stock Exchange was light at 1.39 billion shares, slightly higher than the 1.34 billion traded Monday.\nThe Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks rose 0.86, or 0.2 percent, to 383.09.\nFrance's CAC-40 rose 1.3 percent, and Britain's FTSE 100 gained 1 percent. The stock exchanges in Japan and Germany were closed yesterday.\n\nLoad-Date: January 1, 2003"
