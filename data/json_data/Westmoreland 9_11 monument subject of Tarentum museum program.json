Several supporters and veterans will talk about the monument's purpose, location, site concept, fundraising efforts, design and volunteer opportunities. They also will be accepting donations.\nThe group said more than 5,000 Westmoreland County residents have served in the war on terrorism, and 14 have been killed in action in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nThe monument is expected to cost about $350,000. The group anticipates that most of the cost will be covered by grants and corporate sponsors.\nThe group wants to place the monument at Twin Lakes Park in Hempfield, and dedicate it on Sept. 11, 2021. In March, the group placed a \"future home\" sign at the location at Georges Station Road and Streetpark Loop at the entrance to Peach Plaza.\nThe group is pursuing nonprofit status. In the meantime, Westmoreland Human Services is acting as its nonprofit fiscal sponsor.\nBrian C. Rittmeyer is a Tribune-Review staff writer.
