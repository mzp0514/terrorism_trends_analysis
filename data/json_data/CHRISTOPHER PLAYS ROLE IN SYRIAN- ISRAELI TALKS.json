    "full text": "Secretary of State Warren Christopher met with Syrian President Hafez Assad on Saturday to discuss Israeli proposals to break a deadlock in peace talks between the two nations.\nChristopher delivered to Assad a proposal for Israel to withdraw in stages from the strategic Golan Heights and security plans to ensure the area is not used for attacks on Israeli villages.\nChristopher also carried a list of complaints. They included two perennial topics - terrorism and human rights. The Clinton administration credits Syria with an improved record on both counts, but keeps Syria on a list of seven countries promoting terrorism.\nChristopher also is seeking a detailed account from Assad and Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa of a new arms deal concluded last week with Russia.\nThe Israeli proposals are likely to fall short of Assad's expectations because they did not include a pledge to relinquish all of the Golan Heights, as Assad demands.\nIsrael is offering to withdraw from the Golan Heights, but is not prepared to spell out how much it might yield of the land it captured in the 1967 Middle East war.\nDespite a campaign pledge not to \"go down\" from the Golan, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin already has told Syria he would be willing to exchange part of the border buffer zone in a peace treaty.\nRabin wants most of all to guard against cross-border attacks.\n\nLoad-Date: September 1, 1994"
