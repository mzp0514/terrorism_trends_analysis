    "full text": "To the Editor:\n Your April 10 editorial ''Iran on the Rebound'' included a number of assertions for which there is no evidence.  You stated flatly that the Iraq Government is ''faltering.''\nYour April 10 editorial ''Iran on the Rebound'' included a number of assertions for which there is no evidence.This is indeed a strange conclusion: not a single report of the many that have recently been sent from Baghdad, some by American correspondents, gave any indication whatsoever that the Government of Iraq was in danger.\nhe reason is clear: The Iraqi people's support of their leadership is so manifest that no reporter on the scene can make the assertion you made.\nYou also stated, without any qualification, that ''no great issue of principle'' was involved in the (Iraqi-Iranian) war, totally ignoring the record of the Khomeini regime in fomenting terrorism and subversion throughout the Persian Gulf region and its repeated acts of aggression against Iraq, acts which were documented in numerous official Iraqi protests to Iran.\nSeveral principles are indeed involved, among them violations of international law by Iran. One would think that you could reflect on the facts rather than on unsupported statements.  KAMAL ISSA Press Counselor, Iraqi Interests Section, Embassy of India Washington, April 14, 1982"
