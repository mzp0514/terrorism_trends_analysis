Mr. Siraj, who was arrested in August 2004, was led to believe the police informant would supply the explosives required to carry out the attack, according to court documents.\nAn assistant U.S. attorney, Todd Harrison, indicated that he will not likely dwell on any political beliefs held by Mr. Siraj in the coming trial.\n\"This has nothing to do with politics,\" Mr. Harrison said yesterday in court. \"This case has nothing to do with the war in Iraq. Frankly, there are no allegations of terrorism. ... We are not alleging he was part of Al Qaeda.\"\nThe trial is scheduled to begin April 24 in the courtroom of Judge Nina Gershon at the U.S. District Court in Brooklyn.\n\nLoad-Date: February 16, 2006"
