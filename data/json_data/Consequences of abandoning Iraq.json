Having lived through two world wars and several lesser ones, all of which had their mistakes, this level of impatience surprises me.\nIraq's new government is struggling with compromises like our own new government faced; e.g., it took us decades to resolve the slavery issue. Their internal strife is nothing compared to our Civil War and is not the main problem. Terrorism is.\nIf we leave prematurely, Iraq's brief taste of liberty will end. After the terrorists subdue the new government, attacks on the United States and other democracies will resume, possibly with weapons of mass destruction. Terrorism will flourish as never before.\nSo far, we have lost about 4,000 Americans in Iraq. In World War II, it was about 400,000. I believe the threat to America today is far greater than one percent of the threat we faced in 1941; our civilian casualties already exceed those in World War II (excluding Merchant Marines).\nIn 1961, President Kennedy proclaimed: \"We shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty.\" He did not add \"- unless we lose our patience.\"\nWilliam O. Jewett\nWillow Street\n\nLoad-Date: June 21, 2007"
