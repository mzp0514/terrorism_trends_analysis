The only official Pakistan-India border crossing point for persons who are not citizens of India or Pakistan is in the province of Punjab between Wagah, Pakistan, and Attari, India, the advisory said.\nUrging its citizens not to travel to PoK, the State Department said militant groups are known to operate in the area.\n\"The threat of armed conflict between India and Pakistan remains. Indian and Pakistani military forces periodically exchange fire across the Line of Control,\" it added.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MetroVaartha English.
