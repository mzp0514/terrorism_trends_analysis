One of his detectives was in the dark despite being assigned to the unit that investigated Tsarnaev, Davis said.\n\"They tell me they received no word about that individual prior to the bombing,\" Davis said.\nDavis said he would have liked to have known but conceded that it might not have prevented the attack. The commissioner said his detectives would have wanted to interview Tsarnaev.\n\"The FBI did that, and they closed the case out,\" he said. \"I can't say I would've come to a different conclusion based on the information at the time.\"\nThe House Homeland Security Committee hearing came less than three weeks after Tsarnaev died in a police shootout. His brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, was arrested and faces federal terrorism charges.\nThe committee chairman, Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said the hearing will be the first in a series to review the government's initial response, ask what information authorities received about the brothers before the bombings and whether they handled it correctly.\nThe hearing began laying the groundwork for an expected push for more counterterrorism money. Both Davis and Kurt Schwartz, the Massachusetts homeland security chief, praised federal grants that for years have kept cities flush with money for equipment and manpower.\n\"People are alive today\" because of money for training and equipment, Schwartz said.\nMcCaul and Rep. Bennie Thompson, the top Democrat on the committee, also spoke of the importance of federal money, as did former Sen. Joe Lieberman, one of the founders of the Department of Homeland Security, who took a new seat as a congressional witness.\nLieberman said it would have been possible, albeit difficult, to have prevented the bombing. He said the U.S. should have shared threat information with state and local law enforcement.\n\"When you're dealing with homegrown radicals, the community around them is going to be your first line of defense,\" Lieberman said. \"State and local law enforcement will always have a better knowledge of the neighborhood, the institutions the people are going to be involved with.\"\nFinish line warning\nFive days before two bombs tore through crowds at the Boston Marathon, an intelligence report identified the finish line of the race as an \"area of increased vulnerability\" and warned Boston police that extremists may use \"small scale bombings\" to attack spectators and runners at the event.\nThe 18-page report was written by the Boston Regional Intelligence Center, a command center funded in part by the Department of Homeland Security that helps disseminate intelligence information to local police and first responders.\nThe \"joint special event assessment\" is dated April 10. It notes that at the time there was \"no credible, specific information indicating an imminent threat\" to the race.\n\"The FBI has not identified any specific lone offender or extremist group who pose a threat to the Boston marathon,\" the report reads.\nTsarnaev buried\nThe body of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev has been buried in an undisclosed location outside the city of Worcester, where it had been held for a week at a funeral home, police said Thursday.\n\"As a result of our public appeal for help, a courageous and compassionate individual came forward to provide the assistance needed to properly bury the deceased,\" Worcester police said in a statement.\nMeanwhile, Tsarnaev's widow continues to face questions from federal authorities and has hired a criminal lawyer with experience defending terrorism cases. She has not been charged with a crime.\nKatherine Russell added New York lawyer Joshua Dratel to her legal team, her attorney Amato DeLuca said Wednesday. Dratel has represented a number of terrorism suspects in federal courts and military commissions.\nThe Tribune Washington Bureau contributed to this report.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n A poster board with photos of those who died in the Boston Marathon bombing is put away during the House Homeland Security Committee at a hearing on \"The Boston Bombings: A First Look,\" on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, May 9, 2013.
