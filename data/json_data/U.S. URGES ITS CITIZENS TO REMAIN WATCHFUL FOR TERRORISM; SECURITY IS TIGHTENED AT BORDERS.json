He said 300 would be added through overtime or by shifting people to high priority stations.\nThe additional inspectors will allow the Customs Service to question more people entering the United States at airports, seaports and road crossings, Kelly said.\nAbout 460 million people come into the United States each year through 301 points of entry.     \n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Photo - Cars wait to enter Blaine, Wash., at the U.S.-Canada border Monday after an increase in security ties up traffic.
