Air France gave the flight numbers as 68, 69 and 70.\nThe three other flights were scheduled to leave today - two from Los Angeles and one from Paris. Air France listed those flight numbers as 68, 69 and 71.\nThe airline said it was working to arrange accommodations for stranded passengers.\n\"These flights have been canceled for security reasons. It comes out of a disposition given by American authorities in France,\" said Anna Laban, deputy press attache at the French consulate in Los Angeles.\nIn recent days, Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge had personally been involved in security briefings with French officials, as well as officials from other nations, spokesman Brian Doyle said.\nHe would not name other countries that had been contacted.\n\"We're talking to our counterparts in other countries about security concerns,\" Doyle said.\nSecurity at Los Angeles International Airport had already been tightened to its highest level in two years.\nWith 2.6 million travelers expected to use the airport between Dec. 19 and Jan. 4, airport officials on Wednesday searched cars bound for terminals and prohibited curbside dropoffs and pickups.\n\nLoad-Date: December 25, 2003"
