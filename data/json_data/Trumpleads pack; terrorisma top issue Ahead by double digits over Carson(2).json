His 33% support gives him a double-digit advantage over his closest rival in the crowded GOP field, Ben Carson.\nWhile those surveyed said former Florida governor Jeb Bush has the \"best experience,\" Trump is the candidate Republican voters trust most to deal with terrorism, with 42% preferring the current front-runner. Bush was second with 18%.\nAnd in New Hampshire, whose Feb. 9 primary election is the first in the nation, terrorism has surpassed the economy as the top issue. Again, those surveyed said Trump was best able to handle the issue.\nTrump's response to the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks has been controversial. He's proposed conducting surveillance on mosques and signaled support for a database of Muslims who could be terrorists.\nTrump says that's exactly the point.\n\"Everyone else is coming out with polls saying I'm leading because people are sick and tired of stupid and incompetent people leading our nation,\" Trump said on ABC's This Week.\n\"We have incompetent people.\"\nTrump also embraced enhanced interrogation techniques\n- \"I think waterboarding is peanuts compared to what they'd do to us.\"\nTrump leads the field in the Granite State with just 22%.\nBut with other voters split among a half-dozen competitors, \"Donald Trump's loyal 22% goes a long way in New Hampshire,\" says David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center in Boston.\n\nLoad-Date: November 23, 2015"
