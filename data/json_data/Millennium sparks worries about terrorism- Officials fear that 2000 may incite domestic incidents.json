We're still pursuing any leads we get in.\"\nMore than 50 agents initially worked on the case, Crowley said. The\nagency still has more than 10 people, including analysts, working on\nit, he said.\n\"We have not ruled out going back down there, if we get a substantial\nlead based on the analyses we've received,\" he said.\nIn that case as well as others, federal officials are working with\nlocal police agencies to investigate terrorist activity.\n\"As we get closer to 2000, we'll probably see more people coming out\nof the woodwork,\" Blitzer said. \"Some of these groups have an\napocalyptic vision, and they may go violent.\"\nMany have already come out of the shadows. At a three-day\n\"Preparedness Expo\" here to plan for the coming clashes,\nconventioneers sold books and pamphlets, hawked camping equipment and\nsurvivalist gear and offered up ammo cans, hunting knives and the\nnewest rage: blowguns that fire poisoned darts.\nAll of it, they say, represents the basic necessities for outlasting\nthe millennium, when many who were here believe that the government\nwill attack American citizens. Others predicted that 2000 will see the\ntakeover of the United States by a \"new world order\" of foreign\ndespots.\nStill others claimed that the projected Y2K, or Year 2000, computer\nmeltdown is government hokum to enslave the people.\nAll of them - anti-government militias, hate groups, white\nsupremacists, right-wing Christian zealots - warned that it is time\nfor a second revolution to take back America.\n\"Who is the Antichrist? It's Uncle Sam hiding behind the American\nflag, and all we can see are his eyes,\" said Tom Halverson, who drove\n1,600 miles from Guthrie, Minn., to sell airtight canisters that he\nsaid can keep perishable food safe even in the event of the end of the\nworld. \"I believe that we are coming into a time of worldwide\nmartyrism.\"\nTo gauge the potential threat represented by these predictions,\nBlitzer said, the FBI early next year will launch an ambitious\nnationwide assessment to determine what to expect on, before and after\nJan. 1, 2000.\nThe threat of domestic terrorism has been on the mind of West\nVirginia's public safety experts ever since the bombing of the federal\nbuilding in Oklahoma City, said Otis Cox, state Public Safety\nsecretary.\n\"April 19, 1995, was a rude awakening,\" Cox said.\nThe Mountaineer Militia's plans for a bombing at the FBI Fingerprint\nCenter in Clarksburg in 1996 also heightened awareness of the threat\nof terrorism.\nA number of the departments - from the State Police to the National\nGuard to the Division of Corrections - incorporate anti-terrorism\nactivity into their training and programming.\nCox expects now that security at the Capitol has come under his\npurview, an even greater emphasis will be put on awareness of the\nterrorism threat.\n\"It will most certainly have that focus,\" Cox said. \"I want to make\neveryone in state government aware of this.  Everyone needs to have\na watchful eye.\"\nFor authorities, the threat comes in two forms, and both are difficult\nto track.\nThe first lies behind closed doors, most likely from within some\nChristian compound like those that have arisen in areas around the\nOzarks, the desert Southwest and the Pacific Northwest. There, members\npractice guerrilla war tactics, are often heavily armed and study\nunder the spell of self-styled prophets who warn of a coming\nconfrontation with the federal government.\nThese fortresses are often impregnable to law enforcement undercover\nagents. And the militancy of the rhetoric of such extremists becomes\nclear only when they choose to expose themselves to the outside\nworld.\n\nLoad-Date: August 28, 1998"
