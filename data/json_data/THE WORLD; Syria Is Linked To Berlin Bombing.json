    "full text": "The purported Syrian connection to terrorism was explored again in court testimony in Europe last week.\nAhmed Nawaf Mansour Hazi, a Jordanian and Farouk Salameh, a Palestinian, went on trial in West Berlin and admitted responsibility for an explosion that injured nine people last March at an Arab social club in Berlin.\nBefore the trial, Mr. Hazi said he had obtained the bomb at the Syrian Embassy in East Berlin from a man named Abu Ahmed. In court, he said his pretrial statement had been made under duress - the judge suggested that a threat to expel him to Jordan may have swayed him - and he would not say where the bomb had come from.\nThe Palestinian, Mr. Salameh, said he had accompanied Mr. Hazi's brother, Nezar Hindawi, to Damascus, where they met a man identified as Haitem Said, the name of a senior Syrian intelligence official.\nMr. Hindawi was convicted in London last month of trying to blow up an Israeli airliner. The testimony in his trial also implicated Syria, and Britain broke diplomatic relations with Damascus immediately after the guilty verdict.\nThe United States has also imposed diplomatic and economic sanctions against Syria, which insists it is not sponsoring terrorism.\nMr. Hazi, who has admitted that he went to Libya with Mr. Salameh and Mr. Hindawi, who was seeking support, was arrested in April after the West Berlin discotheque bombing in which two American servicemen and a Turkish woman were killed and 230 people wounded.\nBut he was not accused of responsibility for that attack.\nThe United States blamed Libya and launched an aerial raid on the North African country. Last week, the United Nations General Assembly voted, 79 to 28, with 33 countries abstaining, to condemn the United States attack.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPhoto of Ahmed Hazi (Reuters)"
