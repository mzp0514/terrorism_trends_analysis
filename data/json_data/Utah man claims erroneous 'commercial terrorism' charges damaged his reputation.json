He said he had no interest in advertising in the same lobby, but was bothered that the brochures remained there without authorization from the three-member HOA board.\n\"I don't know if I technically did anything wrong,\" he said. \"In a sense, it's as if someone was to leave a couch on your front doorstep. At some point, they shouldn't be surprised to see it tossed.\"\nEckersley said when he initially saw the brochures, he confirmed with his HOA representative at the Zermatt Resort that the company did not have authorization to put them there. When the brochures weren't removed, he decided to throw them away and left an HOA declaration document in its place, which highlighted the building's restrictions on signs and advertising without permission.\nThe next day, the fliers were back. So again, he threw them away and left a copy of the HOA agreement.\nThe third time he saw the brochures return to the rack, Eckersley said he got fed up and threw the entire cardboard rack in the trash.\nWeeks later, police officers came to his church and arrested him, Eckersley said. He was booked into jail, and charged in 4th District Court with four counts of second-degree felony commercial terrorism and one count of third-degree felony prescription or use of a controlled substance.\nEckersley said he was surprised that the term \"commercial terrorism\" was used in charging documents, because the state legislature amended the wording of the charge to \"commercial obstruction\" during the 2010 session. The charge itself was initially intended to target animal-rights activists who disrupt businesses while protesting, according to previous news accounts.\nHe said the drug charge stemmed from a single prescription pill in his pocket, and said once he could show police the prescription bottle at home, the charge was dropped.\nBut Eckersley, a federal immigration attorney, said the damage was done: The initial charges labeled him \"a terrorist, a drug user and a felon,\" and his businesses suffered.\nWasatch County prosecutor Case Wade said \"there was no calculated decision\" to use the word \"terrorism\" in Eckersley's charging documents, but said it was the wording inserted by the computer program used by prosecutors to draft charges.\n\"We had multiple charges that could potentially fit,\" Wade said. \"We felt like a class A misdemeanor would be a good plea result.\"\nBut Wade said that in order to reach that desired resolution, prosecutors normally would charge a crime only one step higher. However, because there is no third-degree felony crime dealing with commercial obstruction, Wade said Eckersley was charged with the second-degree felonies instead.\n\"It wouldn't have been a slam-dunk case at trial,\" Wade said. \"... We always intended to come down [on the charges].\"\nWade said there was some confusion about whether the brochures were authorized by the Zermatt's HOA to be in the lobby because there are three HOAs that govern various parts of the property.\n\"We charged what we had available to us,\" Wade said. \"When we get a plea deal, we try to get the right plea deal that was just. We weren't thinking he was a terrible guy out there running amok ... It seemed like it was an emotional, ill-thought-out response. We could understand some of his confusion.\"\nBut Eckersley insists that the HOA for his building did not authorize the brochures to be there at that time ccc though the company has since gotten proper approval.\n\"We worked really hard to get that [plea] deal,\" Eckersley said. \"I don't think I did anything wrong. Regardless, there's not anyone in their right mind who is going to fight that or leave it up to 12 jurors [at trial.]\"\nEckersley said he has since lost a number of clients, and is considering filing a defamation suit against police and prosecutors for making untrue statements about the case to the media and labeling him a \"terrorist.\" He doesn't believe criminal charges were warranted, given the situation.\n\"I don't think this was an instance where tax payers dollars needed to be used,\" he said. \"Where the time and docket space needed to be used and one of the community's residents needed to be dragged through the mud. ccc This was a civil remedy from the beginning. This really had no reason to be caught up in the criminal [system.]\"\nEckersley's pleas were held in abeyance, meaning that if he does not commit any other crimes and follows other conditions set by the court, his case will be dismissed in 18 months.\njmiller@sltrib.com\nTwitter: @jm_miller\n\nLoad-Date: September 9, 2015"
