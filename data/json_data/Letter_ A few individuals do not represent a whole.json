    "full text": "In response to Meredith Walker's Sept. 26 letter to the editor, \"Islam: a not so peaceful religion.\"\nIt is truly disheartening to see an individual holding to a warped ideology. I am very interested in what Quran texts Meredith has read that would imply that Islam is anything but a religion that highly values peace among themselves and others. It is not a manual for terrorism, but rather a spiritual text encouraging piety and tolerance.\nAs the philosopher, law professor and Christian anarchist Jacques Ellul described, \"It is impossible to judge the Islamic world in a general way: A hundred different cultures have been absorbed by Islam. It is impossible to study all the doctrines, all the traditions, and all their applications together. Such a study can only be undertaken if one limits oneself to the study of specific questions, disentangling what is true from what is false.\"\nDo not let a very small percentage of the population serve as a representation for the 1.6 billion men, women, and children who define themselves as Muslim.  In addition, there is a significant amount of unrest and political corruption within the Middle East and as such the citizens are not under the same regulations as we.\nI would like to offer reflection that every religion has extremism, but generalities should not be based on the radicals.\nFriederike Doerstling\nGraduate Student\nWant to join the conversation?
