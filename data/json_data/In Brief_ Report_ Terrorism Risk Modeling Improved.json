    "full text": "The ability of private insurers to protect against huge losses from\nterrorism has improved since the Sept. 11 attacks, but a federal backstop\nenacted after the attacks makes market assessment difficult, according to a\nBush administration report.\nThe report, which the President's Working Group on Financial Markets\nreleased Monday, said that insurers have gotten better at modeling risk\nexposure; reinsurance capacity has increased; insurers have shown willingness\nto underwrite additional terrorism risk insurance; and there is more buyer\ndemand for coverage.\nCongress put the backstop in place in 2002, setting a three-year deadline\nfor private insurers to start offering their own coverage without government\nsupport. Congress later extended that deadline by two years, and insurers\nhave asked for even more time.\nThe report indicated that the terrorism risk insurance market is in a\ngood position to survive on its own.\n\"While there are inherent difficulties in evaluating the long-term nature\nof the terrorism risk insurance market with a government program in place, a\nnumber of positive developments have occurred,\" the report said. \"Further\nimprovements in insurers' ability to model and manage terrorism risk ... will\nlikely contribute to the long-term development of the terrorism risk insurance\nmarket.\"\nhttp://www.americanbanker.com            http://www.sourcemedia.com\n\nLoad-Date: October 3, 2006"
