    "full text": "The United Nations Security Council, after ducking the issue for years, voted unanimously last week to condemn hostage-taking. Earlier attempts to deplore terrorism ran afoul of third world and Communist sympathy for self-described liberation movements and insistence on including ''state terrorism'' - a reference to punitive Israeli raids in Arab territory and United States support for Nicaraguan rebels.\nBut after Soviet officials were taken hostage in Lebanon in October, Moscow changed its mind, and other countries followed suit. The Security Council urged members of the United Nations to step up national efforts to prevent and punish hostage-taking and get hostages released.\nThe United States initiated the measure as part of its worldwide battle against terrorists, particularly in the Middle East, where Americans have been frequent targets. At least four American hostages are being held in Beirut; Terry Waite, a special envoy of the Church of England, returned there last week in hopes of arranging their release. Secretary of State George P. Shultz pounded the table when terrorism came up last week at a news conference in Belgrade. ''There must be no place to hide for people who do that sort of thing,'' he said, angered by Yugoslav ambivalence. Yugoslavia (like Italy) ignored American demands in October for the detention of Mohammed Abbas, who is believed to have directed the hijacking of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro."
