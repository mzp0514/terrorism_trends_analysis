I realize they have a job to do, and a responsibility to us citizens to report the news.\nHowever, in my opinion they seem more worried about ratings, and getting a scoop, than in our nation trying to mourn and deal with the loss of family, and loved ones lost in New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington.\n#WEAV.N26RYNF#\nWe are still trying to recover from the events of Sept. 11. Why must the media keep reliving that day, and causing our emotions to unravel and send us riding that emotional roller coaster all over?  When is enough enough?\nIf the media would report the news in a rational way, without giving subjective commentaries, I think that we Americans could rest a little easier. I'm sure everyone would agree that we need a break from all the bad and negative publicity happening around us.\nWhat happened to the times, not so long ago, when you would watch the news to learn about the good things happening to the people in your neighborhood (like someone reaching a ripe old age), or fun and spontaneous interviews with everyday people and where an exciting place to hang out that night was going to be? That rarely ever happens now.\nI thought we were supposed to be getting back to \"business as usual.\" I don't see how that is possible if the media keep making us relive that nightmare.\nI would like to say how proud I am of all Americans in their support to all who were affected on Sept. 11. They are angels sent from above to those in need. Thank you all, and may God bless you like he has the United States.\nDeborah Weaver\nRonks\n\nLoad-Date: November 27, 2001"
