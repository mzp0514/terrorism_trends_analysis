President Fernando Balaunde Terry, attempting to show that democracy can work after 12 years of military dictatorship, has resorted to emergency measures that some leftists have criticized as anti-democratic.\nPeru's democratic government leader, President Fernando Balunde Terry, resorts to emergency measures in attempt to stop increasingly frequent attacks from tenacious group of terrorists\nThe terrorism has been laid to a guerrilla group called Sendero Luminoso, or Lighted Path, and generally described as Maoist.  Operating over a wide area, they sabotaged power lines to Lima, the capital, and a dozen other cities the week before last, then last Sunday attacked a police station in Vilcashuaman in the central Andean state of Ayacucho. Six civil guardsmen and at least 20 terrorists died in the bloodiest battle since civilian rule was restored in Peru in 1980.\nDespite a state of emergency decreed both in Lima and the Ayacucho region and the roundup of 314 persons in the capital, the guerrillas managed to plant a bomb in a Lima newspaper plant and to attack a police post in another town in Ayacucho last week. Since January, the Government reported, 18 policemen and 32 civilians, including 23 alleged guerrillas, have died in the violence. As the police tried to cope, rightists increased their demands that the military step in."
