It's not a matter of \"if,\" but \"when.\" It is a threat from individuals and organizations, including commercial competitors, both foreign and domestic, not just hostile governments.\nAccording to Mark M. Polite from the FBI Laboratory in Washington, cyber-terrorism is \"the premeditated, politically motivated attack against information, computer systems, computer programs, and data which result in violence against noncombatant targets by sub national groups or clandestine agents.\"\nA notice has been posted at the FBI's InfraGard Web site (http://www.infragard.net/), a partnership organization between private companies and government cyber-cops, warning owners of communications infrastructure including commercial and enterprise networks and data centers to be in a state of heightened alert against potential cyber-attacks. Security experts are expecting a tidal wave of cyber-terrorism and hacker activity once the U.S. military retaliates for the terrorism that occurred September 11, although cyber-attacks weren't launched right after the disaster.\nWhat seems to be a recent awareness of cyber-terrorism is, in fact, not so new.\nA 1991 National Research Council report warned of the terrorist threat to and through computers systems. Cyber-terrorism often accompanies and is used in support of traditional terrorist activities. Where detailed planning and intelligence gathering is critical to the success of an organized terrorist activity, cyber-terrorism can play a crucial role.\nThis is not unlike the \"hacktivism\" used by many activist groups to \"hack\" into a system. But it goes beyond the mere threat of taking over a Web site.\nThe 21st century has arrived and, with it, a new electronic world that poses significant business risks. Cyber-terrorism and electronic espionage threatens the security of nations, commercial enterprises and organizations as well as individuals. It must be understood that where there is an information systems presence, there is exposure to risk.\nGlobal terrorists know that winning a physical conflict with major world powers is near impossible. They have now discovered that the critical commercial infrastructure is highly vulnerable to a logical attack, thus jeopardizing our society and way of life. The list of potential targets includes power grids, banks, airlines, air traffic controls systems, trucking and transportation companies, chemical and petrochemical facilities, food manufacturers, retailers, hospitals, and local governments.\nMany of these organizations do not have the necessary controls to detect and repel a serious penetration attempt as proven repeatedly by two experts from Ajilon, LLC, a leading international provider of IT services based in Towson, Md. Jason Taule, Ajilon's national director of Information and Systems Security, and Randy Meyers, Ajilon's national director of Network Security Services, are two of a team of six high-level consultants at Ajilon, LLC (http://www.ajilon.com), who combined have over 121 years experience in Information Systems Security (ISS).\nTaule, who has provided computer security consulting services to civilian and military agencies of the federal government including the Pentagon, DOE, DOD, VA, BIA, and NASA, says, \"We have never been unsuccessful in breaking into or hacking into an information system. We are frequently engaged to test the security of an organization's information systems with the express intent of finding and exposing areas of vulnerability. We have a 100 percent success rate in penetrating and infiltrating.\"\nAjilon, a $1.3 billion IT Consulting firm, is presently working to respond to this threat on behalf of clients in the financial services, insurance, state government, health care, and manufacturing industries. One of Ajilon's clients was headquartered in the World Trade Center. Taule and his colleagues had prepared their information systems recovery and disaster contingency plan, and were in the process of performing their annual risk assessment prior to the terrorist attack. So for those of us living and working in the Digital Harbor, what can be done?\nProtection tips\nHere are few key things to remember to help protect your organization from cyber-terrorism:\n1. All accounts should have passwords and the passwords should be unusual, difficult to guess.\n2. Change the network configuration when defects become known.\n3. Check with vendors for upgrades and patches.\n4. Audit systems and check logs to help in detecting and tracing an intruder.\n5. If you are ever unsure about the safety of a site, or receive suspicious email from an unknown address, don't access it. It could be trouble.\n6. The greatest area of vulnerability is often not with technology, but with personnel. Make sure that you have the appropriate personnel security controls, measures, and training in practice.\nWes Shaffer is senior counselor for Cornerstone, a Baltimore based marketing communications firm, and chairman of the Baltimore County Technology Council, an organization made up of government, education and private business representatives who have an interest in sustaining the growth of the region's high-tech community.
