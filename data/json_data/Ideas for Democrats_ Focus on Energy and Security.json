As Thomas L. Friedman and others have noted, we are financing both sides of the war on terrorism. \n  It seems like a no-brainer that we need political leadership that recognizes this fact and that will lead us to the use of alternative fuels. \n  We can help our economy, we can strike a major blow to terrorism, and we can help the environment.\n  This may not be the only issue that's important in the coming election, but it is an issue that touches many bases. \n  Perhaps Democrats can gain control of Congress based on Republican incompetence and the downward spiral of the war in Iraq. But what are they going to do once they have that victory? \n  Not having a meaningful plan for energy independence would be a missed opportunity of the highest magnitude.\n\nBurt Liebowitz\nRockville, Md., Oct. 8, 2006\n\nTo the Editor:\n  Re ''How the Democrats Can Win: Competence Sells'' (Op-Ed, Oct. 8):\n  Hear, hear, for Rahm Emanuel's advice to the Democratic Party. \n  National security should be the focus of the Democrats' message in November. Not scandal, not blame, and not the tried-and-lost promise of advocacy on behalf of the average hard-working American (as compelling and morally important as it might be).\n  Taking a page from Karl Rove's book and flipping the terrorism issue that the Republicans see as their core strength against them is the only way Democrats can win.\n\nAlex Cho\nDurham, N.C., Oct. 8, 2006\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: October 13, 2006"
