    "full text": "When U.S. officials were trying to gain access to a key al-Qaida operative detained in Yemen, Vice President Dick Cheney picked up the phone and called Saudi Arabia's crown prince.\nThe U.S. ally intervened with the Yemeni president, and the suspect was quickly sent to a friendly third country where U.S. intelligence could question him.\nU.S. and Saudi officials, in rare interviews discussing joint intelligence operations, have told The Associated Press that Saudi Arabia has secretly provided the United States with several diplomatic and intelligence favors in the war on terrorism.\nThe contributions, they said, have gone unacknowledged in part because of concerns that public disclosure might alienate a Saudi citizenry wary of cooperation with America or affect diplomatic relations with other Middle East countries.\nThe confirmation of more than a half-dozen acts of assistance by the Saudis comes when the longtime U.S. ally is trying to counter criticism that it was soft on terrorism before Sept. 11, 2001.\nOfficials said the Saudi desire to counter that criticism, along with a heightened alert inside the kingdom after May 12 terrorist bombings in Riyadh killed 35 people, have freed both sides to discuss previously secret cooperative efforts.\n\"Since Sept. 11, 2001, the two countries have exchanged more than 3,500 memorandums dealing with counterterrorism efforts,\" said Adel al-Jubeir, the crown prince's foreign affairs adviser. \"This represents more than six memos per day and is a clear example of the intensive cooperation.\"\nBoth sides say intelligence sharing has been imperfect but is improving.\n\nLoad-Date: October 19, 2003"
