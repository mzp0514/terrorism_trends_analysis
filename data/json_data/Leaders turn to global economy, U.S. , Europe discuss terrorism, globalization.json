The rift was especially deep between Bush and Chirac, who led the opposition to the U.S.-led war.\nBush, who had a one-on-one session with Chirac today, said he wanted to seek Chirac's advice as he headed later today to the Middle East for a new round of peace negotiations.\nBush said that G-8 discussions had reinforced his belief that joint cooperation between the United States and Europe was critical to resolving global problems.\nBritish Prime Minister Tony Blair told reporters that part of today's discussion was devoted to the efforts being made by European countries such as France and Germany to institute economic reforms that will lead to higher growth. Increased competition due to globalization was forcing all countries to accept the need to do so, he said.\nThe leaders also were preparing an action plan to confront fears that terrorists could use shoulder-mounted missiles to bring down commercial jetliners.\nThe opening day of the G-8 summit Sunday had been devoted to discussions among a much larger group of 11 of the world's major developing countries including China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Malaysia joining a number of African nations.\n\nLoad-Date: June 3, 2003"
