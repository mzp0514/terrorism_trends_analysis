    "full text": "To the Editor:\nTerrorism is the world's war of 1986, and each and every person is a participant. That war's battles are fought with threats and guns.\nIn the televised confrontation with Abu Abbas, the self-proclaimed mastermind behind the hijacking of the Achille Lauro and the murder of Leon Klinghoffer, NBC contributed to the loss of a major battle by airing the Abbas statements.\nNBC gave Abbas the ideal forum. In the past, terrorists have had to kill, hijack or take hostages to get attention. Abbas used this unchallenged forum to threaten to kill Americans on their own shores. On behalf of the P.L.O., he challenged all America and won the contest for chief terrorist of the year, thus increasing his influence to call the shots and his ability to carry out his threats.\nNBC had within its grasp a wanted murderer who has been indicted in three countries. It made a deal to let him get away. NBC could have worked with authorities and put Abbas behind bars instead of consorting with a known felon and helping further his cause.\nOn behalf of our foundation and for all who would strike a blow against terrorism, we ask that this act, masquerading as a news event, be examined by the State and Jus-tice Departments to determine if there are any criminal implications relative to aiding and abetting a known and wanted international criminal. JERRY ARBITTIER Chairman, Leon and Marilyn Klinghoffer Memorial Foundation New York, May 9, 1986"
