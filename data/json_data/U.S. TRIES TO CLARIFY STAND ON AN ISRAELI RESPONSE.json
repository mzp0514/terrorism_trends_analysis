At the same time, State Department officials in Washington said that no such messages had gone out.\nLack of Coordination Blamed\nPhone calls went back and forth on Saturday night and this morning between Washington and Los Angeles to resolve the apparent contradiction, which several officials here said was the result of poor coordination, not a disagreement on policy.\n''We have always been opposed to an escalating cycle of violence which contains the seeds of broader and more devastating hostilities,'' a senior official said today, seeking to clarify the policy. ''In that context, we have urged and will continue to urge all states to avoid taking actions which only feed that cycle.''\n''At the same time, it has been and remains our firm policy that terrorism cannot go unanswered,'' he said. ''We have always retained the right to respond to terrorist acts in an appropriate, measured and focused way.''\n \n'We Have the Option'\n''We want to avoid a widening of conflict and hostilities and the dangers that poses,'' he said. ''But terrorists should know that we have the option of responding in a direct and focused manner to their barbaric acts.''\nHe said that the ''we'' in the policy statement included Israel, as well as the United States.\nOne official said the concern here was that Israel might decide that, because of the Rome and Vienna attacks, there should be an attack on Syrian antiaircraft missile sites in Lebanon without waiting for American diplomatic efforts aimed at having the missiles pulled back to Syria. Thus, the official said, the United States would advise Israel that whatever steps it takes be seen as proportionate to the attacks in Rome and Vienna and not be of the kind that could provoke a major conflict in the region.\nThe Israelis have reserved the right to respond to the Rome and Vienna attacks, but Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, appearing on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press,'' stressed today that Israel viewed the Rome and Vienna attacks as only one development in ''an overall struggle against terrorism.'' Mr. Rabin also said that if the Syrian missiles were not withdrawn, Israel reserved the right to take action against them at a time of its own choosing.\n \nConcern for Peace Process\n''We have heard the message from Washington,'' he said. ''We'll do what we consider to be vital to our interest in this prolonged war against terrorism.''\nRobert B. Oakley, the head of the State Department's counterterrorism office also appeared on that program, and said, ''What we're talking about, I believe, is not allowing terrorists to produce a major disruption of an ongoing process'' toward Middle East peace talks. He cited the example of 1982, when the Israeli Government of Prime Minister Menachem Begin put into motion steps that led to the invasion of Lebanon after Palestinian gunmen shot the Israeli Ambassador to Britain.\nMr. Oakley also said the United States wanted the surge of terrorism to be dealt with by the wider international community, not just by individual nations. This year, the United States obtained passage in the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council of resolutions condemning terrorism, and an Administration official said an effort was under way to sound out other nations on passage of a resolution condemning the Rome and Vienna attacks and nations that give support to those terrorists.\n \n'Not by One Alone'\n''We believe terrorism must be combated,'' Mr. Oakley said. ''It must be combated by many different governments, not by one alone.''\nMr. Oakley said that the United States, at this stage, did not know who carried out the Rome and Vienna attacks. He added, however, that the United States had indications that Libya was ''very much involved'' in the hijacking last month of an Egyptair plane that ended up in Malta. He said the hijacking had been carried out by a renegade Palestinian group whose leader is Mazen Sabry al-Banna, also known as Abu Nidal.\n''This is a very serious problem which we must deal with,'' he said.\nThe Reagan Administration has been seeking broad backing for a policy of trying to isolate the Libyan Government, which it regards as a major supporter of worldwide terrorism. Some officials have expressed the hope that if evidence is found that conclusively links Libya to the Rome and Vienna attacks, momentum will be created to take some kind of international action against Libya. Italy, which controlled Libya before World War II, and Austria have both had extensive relations with Libya, despite the American call for action against the Libyans.\nThe Soviet attitude will be crucial to any international moves against those supporting terrorists, since Moscow has a veto in the Security Council. American officials recently expressed satisfaction that the Soviet Union had gone along with the antiterrorist resolutions. Last fall, a Soviet diplomat was killed in Beirut and three members of the Soviet Embassy staff were held for a month by kidnappers before being released.\nThe Soviet Union supports Mr. Arafat and his allies in the P.L.O., but has also had good ties with Libya. Thus, any action that was seen as anti-Libyan would probably be blocked by the Russians, American officials have said."
