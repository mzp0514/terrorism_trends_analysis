Whatever the truth, the hundreds of foreigners held without charges at Guantanamo Bay have rights under the U.S. Constitution, the Supreme Court says.\nAnd, considering that many have been imprisoned at the Cuban camp for six years, they should be able to exercise those rights quickly and ask civilian judges to force the government to justify their detention, the court ruled Thursday.\nThe court, though deeply divided, issued a strong rebuke to President George W. Bush's anti-terrorism policies. It was the third time the justices have repudiated the president on the detainees, though they still have not made it through the courthouse door.\n\"It's a total loss for the government,\" said former federal prosecutor Andrew McBride, who disagreed with the court's ruling.\nBush said he, too, disagreed and suggested he might seek yet another law to keep terrorism suspects locked up at the prison camp, even as his presidency winds down and Democrats control Congress.\nJustice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the 5-4 high court majority, acknowledged the terrorism threat the U.S. faces - the administration's justification for the detentions - but he declared, \"The laws and Constitution are designed to survive, and remain in force, in extraordinary times.\"\nIn a blistering dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia said the decision \"will make the war harder on us. It will almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed.\" \nBush has argued the detentions are needed to protect the nation in a time of unprecedented threats from al-Qaida and other foreign terrorist groups. The president, in Rome, said Thursday, \"It was a deeply divided court, and I strongly agree with those who dissented.\" He said he would consider whether to seek new laws in light of the ruling.\nSen. Christopher \"Kit\" Bond, R-Mo., criticized the Supreme Court's decision, which he said gives \"foreign terrorists the same rights as Americans.\"\n\"It is disappointing that the Supreme Court rejected precedent going back to World War II and chose to give foreign terrorists the constitutional rights and privileges of U.S. citizens,\" said Bond, who is vice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.\nBut Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said the decision \"will better protect American security and values.\"\n\"The Supreme Court has just disarmed the terrorists of one of their most powerful weapons against us. They can no longer claim that the United States is all talk when it comes to justice and the rule of law,\" Skelton said.\nIn the opinion, Kennedy said federal judges could ultimately order some detainees to be released, but he also said such orders would depend on security concerns and other circumstances. The ruling itself won't result in any immediate releases.\nRoughly 200 detainees have lawsuits on hold in federal court in Washington. Chief Judge Royce C. Lamberth said he would call a special meeting of federal judges to address how to handle the cases.\nDetainees already facing trial are in a different category.\nJustice Department spokesman Peter Carr said Thursday's decision should not affect war crimes trials. \"Military commission trials will therefore continue to go forward,\" he said.\nThe lawyer for Salim Ahmed Hamdan, Osama bin Laden's one-time driver, said he will seek dismissal of the charges against Hamdan based on the new ruling. A military judge had already delayed the trial's start to await the high court ruling.\n---\nTalk\nSTLtoday.com/current Do you agree with the ruling?
