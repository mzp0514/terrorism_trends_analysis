On the opposite corner of the desk rests a blue frame surrounding a picture of a commissioning an officer. Another photo is bordered by thick brown plastic of the ship he once commanded, the USS Simpson.\nIf it weren't for the keepsakes on his small, tidy desk, one might not know Bowdish was once a Navy captain who hunted down smugglers, weathered 75-foot waves or was involved in the obliteration of an Iraqi service fleet.\nMany could see him as another Midwestern man, and he probably wouldn't mind.\nThe ex-officer now teaches Political Science 398 at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, a class he helped develop.\nThe first part of the course examines insurgency and guerilla warfare. The second part focuses on past and present terrorism.\nHis blue jeans, scruffy beard and relaxed posture are evidence of his laid-back natureÂ­ -- not exactly the buzz cut and crisp attire expected from a retired military leader.\n\"It's my last defiance against winter,\" Bowdish said of his overgrown facial hair.\nThe self-proclaimed \"action junkie\" traded in his military suit for blue jeans in 2006 after realizing he wanted to learn more about the scientific methodologies of warfare and to inform students about terrorism.\n\"I love the teaching aspect,\" Bowdish said. \"I love giving back ... by helping to educate this generation about insurgencies, guerilla warfare and terrorism.\"\nThe course is only in its second semester at UNL, but it's becoming more popular.\nThe course started with 34 students this semester, but Bowdish had a problem with telling people no.\n\"So now we have 42,\" he said. \"And no drops. We must be doing something right.\"\nConnor Horn, a junior political science major, enrolled in the course after enjoying another class taught by Bowdish.\n\"He's really interesting,\" said Horn. \"He's done so much. He's been the captain of a warship, and he's got a master's degree. I wonder how he's had so much time to do all of it, and he doesn't look too stressed.\"\nHorn appreciates Bowdish's sense of humor and his ability to relate to college students.\n\"He's really good at putting real world analogies into context,\" Horn said. \"He'll use humor. Instead of saying something's difficult, he may say it's like 'pissing up a rope.'\"\nBowdish's stories are intriguing because of their humor and outlandish nature, but his humility shines through when he talks about his former command.\n\"It's never about me,\" Bowdish says. \"When I commanded, it was about my crew.\"\nHe suggests focusing on the young men and women serving our country today rather than talking about \"old bearded men\" like him.\n\"When you get 18-year-old kids out there, it's amazing what these kids can do,\" he said. \"They do amazing things, and their responsibilities are incredible.\"\n(C) 2008 Daily Nebraskan via U-WIRE\n\nLoad-Date: February 26, 2008"
