    "full text": "In the isolation of a heavily guarded mountain retreat, world leaders challenged President George W. Bush's call for Yasser Arafat's ouster at a summit shaken by new economic tumult Wednesday.\nBush found scant outright support among Group of Eight leaders as he renewed his demand that Palestinians \"make right decisions\" and elect a new leader. Bush has \"given up hope\" on Arafat, a White House spokesman said.\nBritish Prime Minister Tony Blair came closest to the U.S. position - \"there has been an attitude toward terrorism\" under Arafat - while other leaders steered far clear of denouncing Arafat as they gathered in secluded serenity at a Canadian Rockies resort.\n\"With regards to the head of the Palestinian Authority it is, naturally, for the Palestinian people - and them alone - to choose their representatives,\" French President Jacques Chirac told reporters.\nThe Mideast crisis consumed the leaders' one-on-one talks, and more discussions were planned at a private dinner for the eight leaders. Ca nadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien had hoped to keep the focus on African aid, the global economy and terrorism.\nIn a grim reminder of terrorism's threat, camouflaged soldiers, tanks and anti-aircraft missiles stood guard over the green valleys and craggy peaks encircling the resort where Bush and his counterparts met.\nThey released a three-page counterterrorism agreement to improve transportation security. The accord makes no immediate advances but commits the nations to work together on initiatives such as reinforced cockpit doors and travel ID documents including fingerprint or face or iris scans.\nThe leaders sought vague agreement on African aid and help for Russia to manage its nuclear stockpile.\nThe sluggish U.S. economy also squeezed its way into the talks after Bush said corporate scandals have weakened American markets.\n\"There are some concerns about the validity of the balance sheets of corporate America - and I can understand why,\" Bush said. \"We've had too many cases of people abusing their responsibilities.\"\nHe spoke after world markets shook with news that telecommunications giant WorldCom Inc. misstated its earnings by $3.8 billion.\nKept more than 60 miles from the summit site, anti-globalization protesters were less violent and turned out in smaller numbers than at past summits.\nIn relative solitude, the leaders tinkered with an African relief plan they expect to release today. A senior German official said there was still debate over the percentage of overall foreign aid that each nation should dedicate to the continent.\nSome countries want the bar set at 50 percent - a goal that others might find unrealistic.\nOn the Middle East, Chirac called for an international peace conference, a position at odds with Bush, who has dropped talk of a conference until violence ebbs. European leaders, traditionally more sympathetic to the Arab position, openly questioned Bush's policy against Arafat.\nBush advisers said the president doesn't disagree with Chirac and others who say that Palestinians - not America or its allies - must choose their own leaders.\nU.S. officials said Bush won't interfere with Palestinian elections next year.\nBut in a departure from most allies, Bush is linking his support for statehood to the Palestinians' willingness to oust Arafat.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO; (1) Photo by THE ASSOCIATED PRES - Demonstrators occupy an intersection Wednesday in Calgary, Alberta, in an attempt to disrupt traffic during the Group of Eight summit.
