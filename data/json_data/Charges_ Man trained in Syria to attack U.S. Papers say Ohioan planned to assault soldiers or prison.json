Attacking the prison was part of a backup plan, the charges state.\nThe indictment also says Mohamud's brother, Abdifatah Aden, fought with Jabhat al-Nusrah, a State Department-designated terrorist group, until he was killed in battle in Syria in June.\nMohamud, 23, of Columbus, was charged with supporting terrorism, supporting the same terrorist group and lying to an Ohio FBI agent by saying he was in Istanbul when authorities say he was in Syria. He also is charged with making a false statement involving international terrorism.\nThe government charged Mohamud under the laws most commonly used since the Sept. 11 attacks to prosecute terrorism suspects. He faces up to 38 years in prison if convicted.\nMohamud was arrested in Columbus in February on state terrorism and money laundering counts. Thursday's charges were expected, and Mohamud is expected to plead not guilty at an arraignment today, his attorney said.\n\nLoad-Date: April 17, 2015"
