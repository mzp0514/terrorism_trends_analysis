Indian authorities blamed Pakistan for cross-border attacks in the state of Jammu and Kashmir,\" the report said.\nIndia, the report said, continued to apply sustained pressure to detect, disrupt and degrade terror operations within its borders.\nOver the course of 2017, India sought to deepen counter-terrorism cooperation and information sharing with the US, including through the first-ever Designations Dialogue held in Delhi in December, it said.\nIn the same year, India and the US pledged to strengthen cooperation against terrorist threats from groups, including Al-Qaida, ISIS, Jaish-e-Mohammad, Lashkar-e-Taiba and D-Company, it said.\nDuring a June 2017 summit, President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi directed officials to establish a new mechanism for cooperation on terrorist designations.\nThe report further said the Indian government closely monitored the domestic threat from transnational terrorist groups like ISIS and Al-Qaida.\nThe State Department praised India for its significant counter terrorism actions.\nCiting an example of a significant counter-terrorism law enforcement action by India, it said the police arrested Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) leader Mohammad Idris from a hideout in Kolkata on March 8.\nIdris was allegedly involved in the July 2016 Holey Artisan Bakery attack in Bangladesh capital, Dhaka.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MetroVaartha English.
