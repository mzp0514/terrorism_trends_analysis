    "full text": "Innocence took a heavy toll this week.\nMore than 50 people died Thursday in London when terrorists exploded buses and trains, reducing innocent victims to strewn and unidentifiable body parts in the name of an extremist cause.\nEarly Saturday morning, it hit closer to home. In an apparent gesture of revenge for those gruesome acts, someone set a Bloomington Mosque on fire.\nWhile there were thankfully no deaths nor massive damage here, these two acts are rooted in the same misguided anger and monstrous action. Those killed on the subways in Great Britain did nothing to deserve death and their lost lives only provoke a vicious cycle of violence that promises to kill countless more on every side.\nLikewise, firebombing a Bloomington Mosque does no justice to any cause. It merely punishes the innocent and extends the same cycle of hatred and anger.\nTerrorism is terrorism. If it's an expression or a response to one, it is just as wrong. If it's a bloodbath or a building set ablaze, it needs to be stopped.\nWe as a community need to come together now more than ever. We need to understand each other, learn about our differences and celebrate them rather than focus our anger upon them. These are trying times; terrorism has entered our backyard. We must not tolerate it.\nEnough innocence has been lost already.\n(C) 2005 Indiana Daily Student via U-WIRE\n\nLoad-Date: July 11, 2005"
