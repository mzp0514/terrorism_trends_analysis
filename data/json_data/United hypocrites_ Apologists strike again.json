    "full text": "In pathetically predictable fashion, the high commissioner for human rights at the United Nations wants an explanation and details from the U.S. on whether it \"lawfully\" killed Osama bin Laden. \nSo much for that \"watershed moment in our common global fight against terrorism,\" as proclaimed by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The fact is, Turtle Bay hasn't yet fully defined \"terrorism\" almost 10 years after Mr. bin Laden's al-Qaida executed the 9/11 attacks. \nU.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay says the U.S. needs to account for ridding the world of its most-wanted scoundrel. Oh, she admits bin Laden was a \"very dangerous man\" but questions whether he had to die. \n\"The United Nations has consistently emphasized that all counterterrorism acts must respect international law,\" Ms. Pillay said. \nThat is, as defined by the U.N. \nAnd this, from a Human Rights Council that perpetually blasts Western nations for so-called abuses but remains mute on the most reprehensible offenses by the world's worst human-rights abusers -- some of whom enjoy all the privileges of the council's membership. \nWill a U.N. bin Laden probe, if undertaken, along with more criticism from these cretins change the Obama's administration's rosy view of World Hypocrites Central? Probably not. \n\nLoad-Date: May 11, 2011"
