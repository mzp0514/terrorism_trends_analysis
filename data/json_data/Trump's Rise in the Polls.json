One big reason, I believe, is how the candidates have framed their policy proposals. There is little doubt that creating jobs and combating terrorism are the two central themes in this election. Where do the candidates stand?\n  Well, on jobs, Mr. Trump will slash taxes, slash regulations and rewrite all trade deals. Hillary Clinton -- I'm not so sure. On terrorism, Mr. Trump will build a wall, limit immigration and engage in ''extreme vetting.'' Mrs. Clinton -- I'm not so sure. Therein lies the problem.\n  I do not believe in Mr. Trump's proposals, I don't think they will work, but, at least in theory, I know what they are. With Mrs. Clinton, I do not feel that I really know, and I am a supporter. Mrs. Clinton, you must give the voters a positive reason to vote for you. We know the reasons you cite to vote against Mr. Trump. People want more, people need more.\n  KEN DEROW\n  Swarthmore, Pa.\n  To the Editor:\n  Re ''When a Crackpot Seeks Office,'' by Nicholas Kristof (column, Sept. 15):\n  One of the problems with the idea of the media calling out Donald Trump on his numerous lies is that the first thing someone like Mr. Trump does is to convince his followers that the media are liars and he is the only source of truth. The more they attack him -- that is, accurately and vigorously report on him -- the deeper the true believers dig in.\n  JOHN GREER\n  Lacey, Wash.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/17/opinion/donald-trumps-rise-in-the-polls.html\n\nLoad-Date: September 17, 2016"
