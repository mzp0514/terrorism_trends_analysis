    "full text": "Hitting a city block like a meat cleaver, a car bomb razed a busy Jewish community center in Buenos Aires last week, killing 46 people in the worst attack on Jews outside of Israel since World War II.\nStriking at the heart of Latin America's largest Jewish community, the bomb reduced to jagged masonry a building that for 50 years housed the social welfare and political organizations of Argentina's 250,000 Jews. More than 200 people were injured; dozens more are still missing. The explosion also destroyed archives that documented one century of Jewish life in Argentina.\nMonday's bomb exploded two years after a similar unsolved car bomb exploded 16 blocks away, destroying the Israeli embassy and killing 30 people. On Friday a Lebanon-based Islamic group, the Partisans of God, took responsibility for the latest bombing as well as the bombing of a plane in Panama on Tuesday that killed 21 people, most of them Jewish businessmen.\nFollowing the blast, a series of telephoned bomb threats to Jewish organizations kept Buenos Aires on edge. With school vacation ending tomorrow, parents and teachers are forming security teams to protect Jewish kindergartens and schools. \"On Monday, our schools will open,\" Alberto Krupnicoff, president of the bombed Jewish mutual aid association, told 150,000 people who braved a cold rain Thursday to rally under the slogan, \"Standing Up To Terror.\"   JAMES BROOKE\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPhoto: Victims of bombing in Buenos Aires.
