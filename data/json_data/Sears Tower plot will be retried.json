    "full text": "MIAMI (AP) - In a stinging defeat for the Bush administration, one of seven Miami men accused of plotting to join forces with al-Qaida to blow up Chicago's Sears Tower was acquitted Thursday, and the case against the rest ended in a hung jury.\nFederal prosecutor Richard Gregorie said the government planned to retry the six next year, and the judge said a new jury would be picked starting Jan. 7.\nThe White House had seized on the case to illustrate the dangers of homegrown terrorism and trumpet the government's post-Sept. 11 success in infiltrating and smashing terrorism plots in their earliest stages.\nLyglenson Lemorin, 32, had been accused of being a \"soldier\" for alleged ringleader Narseal Batiste. He buried his face in his hands when his acquittal was read.\nLemorin, a legal U.S. resident originally from Haiti, was subject to an immigration hold and would not be immediately released, his lawyer said.\nThe jury gave up on the other defendants after nine days of deliberations on four terrorism-related conspiracy charges that carry a combined maximum of 70 years in prison. The jury twice sent notes to the judge indicating they could not reach verdicts but were told to keep trying.\nU.S. District Judge Joan Lenard declared a mistrial after their third note, which she quoted as saying: \"We believe no further progress can be made.\"\nProsecutors said the \"Liberty City Seven\" - so-named because they operated out of a warehouse in Miami's blighted Liberty City section - swore allegiance to al-Qaida and hoped to forge an alliance to carry out bombings against America's tallest skyscraper, the FBI's Miami office and other federal buildings.\n\nLoad-Date: December 14, 2007"
