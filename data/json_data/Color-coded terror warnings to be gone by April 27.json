    "full text": "WASHINGTON - By the end of April, terror threats to the U.S. will no longer be described in shades of green, blue, yellow, orange and red, The Associated Press has learned.\nThe nation's color-coded terror warning system will be phased out beginning this week, according to government officials familiar with the plan. The officials requested anonymity to speak ahead of an announcement scheduled Thursday by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano.\nThe Homeland Security Department and other government agencies have been reviewing the Homeland Security Advisory System's usefulness for more than a year. One of the most notable changes to come: The public will no longer hear automated recordings at U.S. airports stating that the threat level is orange.\nThe Obama administration will take the next three months to roll out a replacement, which will be called the National Terrorism Advisory System.\nThe new plan calls for notifying specific audiences about specific threats.\nIn some cases, it might be a one-page threat description sent to law enforcement officials describing the threat, what law enforcement needs to do about it and what the federal government is doing, one of the officials said.\nWhen agency officials think there is a threat the public should know about, they will issue an announcement and rely on news organizations and social media outlets to get the word out.\nThe five-tiered color-coded terror warning system, created after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, was one of the Bush administration's most visible anti-terrorism programs. Criticized as too vague to be useful in communicating the terror threat to the public, it quickly became the butt of late-night talk show jokes.\nThe government hasn't made changes in the colored alert levels since 2006.\n-The Associated Press\n\nLoad-Date: January 27, 2011"
