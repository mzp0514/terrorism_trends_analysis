Booth St.\n As Americans, we should be encouraged by the recent success of the military campaign in Afghanistan, but we should also recall the president's previous statement that the war against terrorism must be waged on many different fronts.\nIt is, then, most unfortunate that neither the Bush administration nor Congress have utilized one of the most important weapons in our war against terrorism - energy conservation.\nMandating an increase in the fuel efficiency of vehicles and pursuing the development of renewable energy sources would enable the United States to free itself from dependency on the oil reserves of countries such as Saudi Arabia.\nThis supposed ally of the United States is not only notoriously corrupt, but also the leading exporter of the kind of Islamic fundamentalism exemplified by the Taliban. Our national security would be greatly strengthened if we could detach ourselves from this country instead of showering it with military aid and protecting it with our troops.\nUnfortunately, however, the energy policy proposed by the Bush administration last summer and reaffirmed as recently as a month ago is one that, to paraphrase Vice President Cheney, recognizes energy conversation as a private virtue, but not a public policy.\nApparently, the former oil tycoons in charge of our country believe that most Americans feel that although blood may be thicker than water, oil is even thicker than blood.\n\nLoad-Date: December 17, 2001"
