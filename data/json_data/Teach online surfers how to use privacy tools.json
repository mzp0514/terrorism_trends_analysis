However, I do not think that we need to get the government involved. What we need is to educate users that they can stop this tracking by using features provided by their Web browsers (\"Push to limit tracking of Web users threatens ads,\" Cover story, News, Monday).\nMicrosoft's Internet Explorer has a feature called InPrivate browsing. This feature  can block a website from depositing cookies on your machine and  prevent a history being kept of the sites you visit. It also has a feature to limit  what kind of cookies are stored so you can choose the amount of anonymity you want.\nFirefox also has a feature called private browsing.\nHow about writing an article that shows users how to use these features?  Let's tell the government to forget about more regulations and start working on balancing the budget.\nGene Madsen\nFort Collins, Colo.\n'Do Not Track' makes sense\nLet's put the  call for a \"Do Not Track\" plan to a real-life scenario. We wouldn't want someone following us around while we drove to and from work, were at school,  shopped or went on vacation, would we?\nPlacing this debate into perspective  would allow even proponents to second-guess their support of maintaining the status quo of self-regulation of the online advertising industry.\nMark Perry\nPhoenix\nA cost to add lawmakers\nUSA TODAY's article  about  a lawsuit in favor of increasing the number of U.S. representatives to create congressional districts with more equal sizes  ignored or disregarded a couple of key issues (\"Size matters, lawsuit says of U.S. House,\" News, Monday).\nThe Founding Fathers were aware of the potential  imbalances of representation, so they created two legislative houses. The argument could be made that those states with  smaller populations are overrepresented in the Senate.\nAnother poignant question:  What is the taxpayer burden for adding each representative,  his or her staff, and their government benefits, expenses and pensions?\nDon't the purveyors of this lawsuit, our justices and the government have anything better to do with their time?\nGeorge Irrgang\nChadds Ford, Pa.\nAvoid bias or help FBI?\nCommentary writer Tom Krattenmaker's piece \"Soul-searching in Portland\" about the attempted bombing at the Christmas tree-lighting ceremony was very sympathetic to Portland, Ore., and its over-the-top efforts to avoid discrimination (On Religion, The Forum, Dec. 6).\nWhile he gave credit to the FBI for stopping the terrorism,  he was rather duplicitous in  failing to mention that the Portland City Council voted in 2005 to withdraw from participating in the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force.\nI guess Portland was lucky that the FBI stuck to its task.\nJack James\nVilas, N.C. \n\nGraphic\n\n \nGRAPHIC, B/W\n\nLoad-Date: December 16, 2010"
