    "full text": "BEIRUT, Lebanon -- President Bashar al-Assad denied Sunday that the Syrian government played a role in the massacre in the village of Houla, using his first speech in five months to reiterate his line that foreigners were fomenting the violence in Syria.\nAddressing a Parliament just selected under a new Constitution, Mr. Assad said that the election was ''a slap'' against those questioning the reforms in Syria, that the country's problems were rooted in terrorism rather than lack of political change, and that dialogue with the opposition remained possible.\nMr. Assad, speaking for about an hour at an ornately carved wooden podium, described himself as horrified by the Houla massacre, saying that ''even monsters couldn't perpetrate what we have seen.''\n''Our hearts bled and our anger was indescribable when we saw the painful scenes on television,'' he said. ''The Arabic language and human language cannot describe the scenes we witnessed at Houla.''\nHe noted that government forces had initially been accused of causing the deaths by artillery shelling, but that the claim was later revised. The president lumped together the Houla case with what he called the general assault that Syria had faced for 15 months.\nThe May 25 attack at the village left 108 people dead, 49 of them children. Most were shot at close range or stabbed. Villagers said their assailants were shabiha, or armed militiamen controlled by the government, who came from nearby villages and are from the same minority Alawite sect as the president.\nWhile stopping short of blaming Syria directly, the United Nations found indications that the shabiha had carried out the attack, and the Security Council criticized the Syrian government for using heavy artillery against civilian areas.\nActivists were dismissive of Mr. Assad's speech, both for his denying any military role in the deaths at Houla and his comments that the Syrian military was defending the country against foreign powers.\n''We have eyewitnesses from the massacre, and they know who did it,'' said Salim Qabbani, an activist in the Homs area. ''It was the shabiha who are supported and encouraged by the Syrian Army. The one waging war on the Syrian people is the regime, which is using its heavy weapons to attack civilians and to destroy entire cities.''\nMr. Assad said Syria was under assault from outside because of its long history of backing the ''resistance,'' a term used to describe standing up to Israel in particular and the West in general. ''It is about the role of Syria, the militant role of Syria, Syria's support for resistance,'' he said Sunday. ''They want to harm this role, they want to crush it, they want to divide this nation.''\nKofi Annan, the envoy to Syria for the United Nations and the Arab League, said last week in a visit to Syria that the government should begin enacting the six-point United Nations peace plan that Syria accepted in March. It includes a cease-fire and a political dialogue with the opposition. He said the onus was on the government as the stronger power to get the plan moving.\nMr. Assad did not directly address Mr. Annan's suggestions, saying he wanted to speak about the domestic aspects of the crisisrather than the international ones.\n''The crisis is not internal,'' Mr. Assad said. ''Rather it is a foreign war with internal tools, and everybody is responsible for defending the homeland.''\nHe repeated that his government was ready to talk to its opponents as long as they were not beholden to foreign governments.\nThe Houla massacre raised international concerns that diplomatic efforts were failing and that regional sectarian war might be nearing, reviving some debates on intervention.\nRussia and China -- whose votes would be crucial to any United Nations action -- have reiterated their opposition to Western military action since the Houla massacre. On Monday, the Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper laid out its case again.\n''The Syrian question should be resolved by the Syrian people,'' said the commentary in People's Daily. ''Outside powers do not have the right to stick their hands in.''\nThat position echoed remarks by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who said on Friday that while he saw worrying signs of an emerging civil war in Syria, he was opposed to Western intervention. ''You cannot do anything by force,'' Mr. Putin said.\nAt least 10,000 civilians have died by United Nations count, and the Syrian government says more than 2,600 members of the security services have been killed.\nThere has been some evidence of foreign jihadists fighting in Syria, but most of the violence involves clashes between the military and the Free Syrian Army, a patchwork of local militias formed by the opposition.\n''We should fight terrorism so that it will not dissuade us from our path,'' Mr. Assad said. ''Terrorism has nothing to do with the political process.''\nUsing language reminiscent of the leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Mr. Assad said his critics hated that idea that reform was moving ahead in Syria. ''Holding the elections for the people's assembly as scheduled slapped those who wanted Syria to close in on itself, to drown in the blood of its people,'' he said.\nMr. Assad has the reputation for speaking like a stilted university professor, and this address was no exception. It drew somewhat limited applause from a Parliament with a history of rigorous clapping for presidential speeches.\nMr. Assad, 46, inherited the presidency from his father in 2000 and has been promising to open up the political system ever since. He repeated that promise on Sunday.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO: President Bashar al-Assad of Syria addressing the Parliament in Damascus on Sunday.
