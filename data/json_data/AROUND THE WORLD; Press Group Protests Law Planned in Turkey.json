    "full text": "The International Press Institute, representing nearly 2,000 editors and publishers around the world, has protested a press law being prepared by the military Government of Turkey, saying the matter should be left to the government formed after the election promised for November.\nThe protest was made in a message from Peter Galliner, director of the institute in Zurich and London, to Turkey's head of state, Gen.  Kenan Evren.\nThe International Press Institute, representing nearly 2,000 editors and publishers around the world, has protested a press law being prepared by the military Government of Turkey, saying the matter should be left to the government formed after the election promised for November.Since the military took power in 1980 to stem a wave of terrorism and unrest, the once lively Turkish press has been subdued by the threat of prosecution and suspension of publication.\nMr. Galliner termed the new bill ''an outright violation of press freedom and freedom of expression'' and reminded General Evren of his Government's commitments under international agreements.\n''The proposed increase in penalties, the responsibilities put onto editors, writers and publishers alike,'' he wrote, ''the increased threat of prison sentences and fines, the suggested prosecution of even unpublished naterials, all these make a mockery of official statements which you and your Government have made since the referendum on the re-establishment of a free press.''"
