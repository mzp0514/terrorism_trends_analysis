Terrorist bombs, exploding in two London parks one midday last week, served as the grimmest reminder in nearly three years that if Britain does not consider itself at war, the Irish Republican Army does.\nTerrorist bombs exploded in two London parks last week\nEight soldiers were killed outright - two died later - and more than 50 people were injured. One bomb sent four- and six-inch nails ripping through a detachment of the Queens Household Cavalry in Hyde Park and a second one, two hours later in Regent's Park, went off under a bandstand as the Royal Greenjackets performed. Six of the dead were band members, some literally blown to bits. Seven cavalry horses were killed or had to be destroyed.\nThe I.R.A., which seeks the reunification of Ireland, acknowledged planting the bombs. The group said it is ''now our turn to properly invoke Article 51 of the United Nations statute,'' which deals with a nation's right of self-defense. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher frequently mentioned it during the Falkland war.\nIt was the I.R.A.'s most costly violence since August 1979, when the outlawed organization assassinated Lord Mountbatten and killed 18 British soldiers. Some speculated that bombings were linked to the conviction the week before of an Irish nationalist. Others noted that James Prior, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, was coincidentally visiting the United States in an effort to stem sympathizers' gifts to the I.R.A. In any case, police said the bombings might signal a new round of terrorism.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nIllustrations: photo of injured musician"
