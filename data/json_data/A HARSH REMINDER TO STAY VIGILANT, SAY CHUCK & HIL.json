Chuck Schumer said.\n\"It also shows that the threat of homegrown terrorism is undoubtedly on the rise.\"\nAs security around the U.S. was cranked up following the discovery of two cars loaded with gasoline and nails, New Yorkers were once again reminded of their vulnerability in the face of those determined to wreak havoc. Police patrols were increased across the country and Sen. Hillary Clinton urged residents to be on the lookout for anything suspicious.\n\"Today's news reminds us that we must remain vigilant and direct our limited homeland security resources to the most vulnerable areas of our country,\" she said.\n\"It's important to remain steadfast here and abroad and not become complacent when it comes to our homeland security.\"\nDespite the increased police presence, the White House said there were no immediate plans to raise the U.S. national threat level, which is currently at yellow.\n\"There is no specific or credible evidence of any threat of any kind against the United States of America . . . nor are we changing the terror alert,\" said White House press secretary Tony Snow.\ncboyle@nydailynews.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \nNYPD sends squad cars to streets near the United Nations building yesterday, just hours after two cars loaded with deadly explosives and set to blow were found in a crowded part of London.
