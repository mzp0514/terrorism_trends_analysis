They include leaning on Internet companies and social media to help in the fight, creating an improved database of suspected extremists, and increasing intelligence-gathering on jihadis and other radicals - in part by making it easier to tap phones. The government will hire 2,600 counterterrorism officers, 1,100 of them specifically for intelligence services.\nMeanwhile, at the European Union headquarters in Brussels, new efforts are being made to overcome privacy objections and make the sharing of air passenger information easier. But continental leaders warned about going too far, at the risk of undermining individual rights that are a cornerstone of the European way of life.\n\"The last thing\" is for Europeans \"to change the nature of our open societies as a reaction to this threat. Because then, we would play into the hands of these terrorists,\" EU Vice President Frans Timmermans said.\nSome calls have emerged for a European equivalent of the USA PATRIOT Act, which was passed within weeks of the Sept. 11 attacks, to strengthen the hand of authorities to prevent terrorism. Some of its components were controversial (and some unconstitutional) - such as the unprecedented authority to search, seize, detain or eavesdrop in pursuit of suspected terrorists.\nIsabelle Falque-Pierrotin, head of France's national data protection agency CNIL, said her agency would insist that any additional snooping privileges for France's intelligence services should be allowed only if they were matched by greater protections for personal data.\nFrance has repeatedly strengthened its counterterrorism laws over the years, including a measure passed in November that focused on preventing extremists from joining fighters abroad. One measure, set to be activated in the coming weeks, would allow authorities to ask Internet service providers to block sites that glorify terrorism.\nDespite rights concerns, the EU feels it can move forward on several fronts, and the first stop is airports.\nUp to three new measures to better screen and detect electronic devices carried onto flights are in the pipeline, said an official involved in drawing up the EU's new security strategy.\nAuthorities across the continent are concerned about more than 3,000 Europeans who have traveled to fight in Syria and Iraq, and have noted the difficulty in tracking them. The three gunmen in the Paris attacks claimed allegiance to the Islamic State group and al-Qaida in Yemen.\nRecently France and Belgium have deployed soldiers in the streets, particularly around public buildings, but defending soft targets such as supermarkets or sports events is the big challenge. French President Francois Hollande's office announced Wednesday a reduction in military job cuts to better fight terrorism.\nSome nations are even considering taking passports away from suspects because it is almost impossible to establish whether they might be joining the free Syrian rebels or Islamic State group.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n French Prime Minister Manuel Valls unveils new security measures at the Elysee Palace in Paris, Wednesday, Jan. 21, 2015.
