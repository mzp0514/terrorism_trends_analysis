    "full text": "Americans appear to be echoing Washington's concerns about Olympic security.\nA new survey showed that 61 percent of Americans are at least somewhat concerned that the Games could be a target for terrorists.\nOlympic officials say that more than 20,000 federal, state and local law enforcement officers and private security guards will make Atlanta the \" safest place in the world\" during the summer.\nBut terrorist attacks in Oklahoma City and at the World Trade Center in New York, as well as strikes in the heart of security-conscious Israel, have raised fears that no amount of preparation may be enough.\n\"Americans actually have a long memory of Munich,\" said J. Walker Smith, managing partner of Yankelovich Partners, the marketing research firm that conducted the survey.\n\"Enough dreadful things have occurred in the last couple of years, it is a re asonable concern. People just don't feel the Olympics are immune from these kinds of things,\" Smith said.\nThe survey also indicated that Americans believe Olympic athletes such as Carl Lewis and Michael Johnson are better role models for children than professional athletes.\nOf those polled, 47 percent rated Olympic athletes as the best role models, as opposed to 28 percent for pro athletes and 17 percent for college athletes.\nThe telephone poll of 1,000 Americans had a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.\n\nLoad-Date: July 17, 1996"
