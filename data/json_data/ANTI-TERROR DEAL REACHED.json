    "full text": "WASHINGTON Congressional leaders yesterday agreed on a compromise anti-terrorism bill and the House and Senate are expected to send it to President Clinton's desk by Friday.\nThat is the first anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing, which killed 168 people.\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said the bill \"adds important tools to the government's fight against terrorism and does so in a temperate manner that is protective of civil liberties.\"\nBut Rep. Charles Schumer (Brooklyn), the ranking Democrat on the House crime subcommittee, called the legislation \"half an anti-terrorism bill.\"\nThe final version worked out by House-Senate negotiators allows courts to deport suspected terrorists using classified evidence not disclosed to the suspect.\nLeft out of the bill is language allowing for \"multi-point\" wiretapping of terrorist suspects. Attorney General Janet Reno argued that criminals can easily change cellular phones while law enforcement agents must get court orders to wiretap every single phone line.\nThe bill requires taggants, or markers, on plastic explosives to help identify bombers, but asks for only a study of the need for taggants on powder or chemicals such as the fertilizer used to make the Oklahoma City bomb.\n\nLoad-Date: April 17, 1996"
