    "full text": "SAN FRANCISCO - A federal judge who oversaw a secret U.S. spy court almost shut down the government's domestic surveillance program designed to fight terrorism after he \"lost confidence\" in officials' ability to operate it, documents show.\nThe documents were released Tuesday as part of a lawsuit by Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties group. They relate to a time in 2009 when U.S. spies went too far in collecting domestic phone data and then misled the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court about their activities.\nU.S. District Judge Reggie Walton issued a blistering opinion in March 2009 after discovering government officials had been accessing domestic phone records for nearly three years without \"reasonable, articulate suspicion\" that they were connected to terrorism.\nWalton said the government's excuse that the program was complicated \"strained credulity,\" and he ordered the National Security Agency to conduct an \"end-to-end\" review of its processes and policies while also ordering closer monitoring of its activities.\nLater in 2009, a Justice Department lawyer reported to the spy court a \"likely violation\" of NSA surveillance rules. The lawyer said that in some cases, it appeared the NSA was distributing the sensitive phone records by email to as many as 189 analysts, but only 53 were approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to see them.\n- The Associated Press\n\nLoad-Date: September 11, 2013"
