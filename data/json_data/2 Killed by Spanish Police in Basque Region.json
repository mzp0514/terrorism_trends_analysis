    "full text": "The police killed two Basque rebels in a shootout in the northern city of Bilbao today and later arrested 12 other members of a Basque commando unit, the Interior Minister, Jaime Mayor Oreja, said in a nationally televised news conference.\nThe two gunmen fired first as uniformed officers closed in on them on a narrow street, the minister said. The gunmen were about to enter a car that the police had kept under surveillance after it was used in a terrorist attack last May, he said.\nIt was the most dramatic police action against the Basque separatists since last July, when officers rescued a prison guard held hostage for 17 months by the rebels. But the Interior Minister predicted that Spain's fight against terrorism was far from over.\n\"There is no reason to rejoice,\" he said. \"It's a long battle that will require the unity of all,\" apparently referring to political bickering over how to neutralize the Basque separatist group E.T.A., whose initials stand for Basque Homeland and Freedom.\nMillions of Spaniards marched against terrorism in July after the rebels killed a young town councilman. All political parties, except the one linked to the rebels, vowed then to maintain a united front against E.T.A.\nBut leaders of the opposition Socialist Party have since accused the minority conservative Government of grandstanding in the fight against terrorism. And the political parties have not agreed on new measures they promised would swiftly crack down on the rebels and their supporters.\n\nLoad-Date: September 25, 1997"
