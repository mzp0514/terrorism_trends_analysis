    "full text": "To the Editor:\nRalph A. Brooks's Sept. 20 letter (''McHenry's Slur'') underscored the concern I had when I first read your Sept. 13 news story, reporting my remarks on the reprehensible murder in Queens of an attache at the Cuban mission.\nAt a press conference on Sept. 12, I had responded to a question about the New York City Police and the course of its investigation of Omega 7 by saying the following:\n''The problem as I understand it is that we are dealing with a very tight-knit group of fanatics. And it is very difficult for the F.B.I. to crack that group since it is so small and is so tight-knit. I think that their (the F.B.I.'s) efforts have improved over the last several months, but I wouldn't be satisfied until they apprehend those who have committed these acts. Their actions stain not only the cause which these people profess to be pursuing, but they also stain the United States.\nAN-A\nAnd they doubly damage us therefore.'' My point, which both the article and the headline distorted, was that the misguided actions of those who have claimed responsibility for performing a series of vile acts not only damage the group's purported ''cause'' but also, by contributing to an atmosphere of violence, damage the country in which they live.\nI hope this clears up the question in Mr. Brooks's mind. Please note that in my remarks I was not referring to a ''random act'' but to a pattern of acts by this group over several years. As I said in a statement issued after this particularly tragic event, ''This is a country of justice and of respect for law. Lawlessness and terrorism have no place. A thorough investigation â€¦ will be pursued vigorously.''\nDONALD F. MCHENRY, United States Representative to the United Nations, New York, Sept. 26, 1980"
