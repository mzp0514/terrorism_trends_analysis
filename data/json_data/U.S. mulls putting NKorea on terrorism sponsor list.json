The comedy involves a plot to assassinate North Korea's leader.\nObama is promising to respond \"proportionately\" to an attack that law enforcement blames on North Korea. \"We're not going to be intimidated by some cyberhackers,\" he said.\nThe president said the U.S. would examine the facts to determine whether North Korea should land back on the terrorism sponsors list.\n\"We're going to review those through a process that's already in place,\" Obama told CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\nWhile raising the possibility of a terrorism designation, Obama also asserted, \"I don't think it was an act of war. I think it was an act of cybervandalism that was very costly, very expensive. We take it very seriously.\"\n\nLoad-Date: December 22, 2014"
