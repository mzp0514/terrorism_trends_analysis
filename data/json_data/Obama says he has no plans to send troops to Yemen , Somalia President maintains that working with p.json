However, he said, \"in countries like Yemen, in countries like Somalia, I think working with international partners is most effective at this point.\"\nTerrorism concerns are rising in Yemen, at the bottom of the Arabian peninsula, and in Somalia, critically situated along key global shipping routes to Mideast oil fields. U.S. officials say they believe the suspect in the Detroit airliner attack received al-Qaida training in Yemen.\n\"I have no intention of sending U.S. boots on the ground in these regions,\" Obama said.\nPeople magazine released on Sunday a transcript of the interview conducted Friday.\nIn San'a, Yemen, on Sunday, Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh said he was ready to talk to al-Qaida members who renounce violence, suggesting he could show them the same kind of leniency he has granted militants in the past despite U.S. pressure to crack down on the terrorist group.\nYemen is moving cautiously in the fight against al-Qaida, worried over a potential backlash in a country where anger at the U.S. and extremism are widespread. Thousands of Yemenis are battle-hardened veterans of past \"holy wars\" in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Chechnya and Iraq, and though most are not engaged in violence now, they preserve a die-hard al-Qaida ideology.\n\"Any movement against al-Qaida will lead to the fall of the Yemeni regime,\" warned Ali Mohammed Omar, a Yemeni who fought in Afghanistan in 1990-92 and says he met Osama bin Laden twice in that time.\nIf the U.S. or its allies become directly involved, \"the whole (Yemeni) people will become al-Qaida. Instead of 30 or 40 people, it would become millions,\" he said in an interview.\nYemeni forces recently launched their heaviest strikes and raids against al-Qaida in years, and Washington has praised San'a for showing a new determination against al-Qaida's offshoot in the country.\nThe United States has increased money and training for Yemen's counterterrorism forces, calling al-Qaida in Yemen a global threat after it allegedly plotted a failed attempt to bomb a U.S. passenger jet on Christmas Day.\nBut Saleh's comments raised the possibility that he could continue a policy that has frustrated U.S. officials in the past - releasing al-Qaida militants on promises they will not engage in terrorism again.\nSeveral have since broken those promises and are believed to have returned to al-Qaida's ranks.\n\"Dialogue is the best way ... even with al-Qaida, if they set aside their weapons and return to reason,\" Saleh said in an interview with Abu Dhabi TV aired late Saturday.\nHe said Yemen would pursue those who continued violence, but, \"We are ready to reach an understanding with anyone who renounces violence and terrorism.\"\nIn the past, Yemeni officials have defended the reconciliation policy as a necessity, saying force alone cannot stop al-Qaida.\nSaleh's government has been weakened by multiple wars and crises. It has little authority outside a region around the capital, and tribes dominate vast areas of the impoverished mountainous nation - many of them bitter at the central government for failing to develop their regions.\n\nLoad-Date: January 16, 2010"
