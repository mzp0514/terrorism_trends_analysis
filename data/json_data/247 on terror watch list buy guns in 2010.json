(AP) - More than 200 people suspected of ties to terrorism bought guns in the U.S. last year legally, FBI figures show.\nThe 247 people who were allowed to buy weapons did so after going through required background checks as required by federal law.\nIt is not illegal for people listed on the government's terror watch list to buy weapons. For years, that has bothered Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., who is trying again to change the law to keep weapons out of the hands of terrorists.\nThe secret, fluid nature of the terror watch list has made closing what Lautenberg calls a \"terror gap\" in the nation's gun laws a challenge. About the same number of people suspected of ties to terrorism also successfully purchased guns in the U.S. in 2009. The FBI provided the new numbers to the Government Accountability Office, Congress' investigative arm, and the figures were obtained by The Associated Press.\nThe government can only prevent people from buying guns for any of 11 reasons. Convicted felons and illegal immigrants, for example, cannot buy weapons. But the terrorist watch list is different. People become convicted felons only after a court process and an opportunity to defend themselves. The watch list is secret and generated at the government's discretion. It is not a list of people convicted of terrorism crimes.\n\nLoad-Date: May 20, 2011"
