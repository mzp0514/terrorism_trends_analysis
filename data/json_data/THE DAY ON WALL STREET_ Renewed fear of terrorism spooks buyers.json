Dow Jones News Service said Dana's board is evaluating the new offer.\nAnd Sun Microsystems announced plans for a partnership with chip maker Advanced Micro Devices, designed to help the companies compete better against larger producers such as Intel.\nIn earnings news, Lowe's shares fell 72 cents to $57.91 despite a 33 percent rise in third-quarter profits that also beat analyst expectations by 3 cents a share. Larger rival Home Depot fell 72 cents to $35.47.\nOn the economic calendar, the Commerce Department said America's businesses boosted their stockpiles of unsold goods in September for the first time in six months. Analysts took that as a sign that companies may be more confident about the economic recovery. Economists were expecting inventories to be flat in September.\nAn economic index compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed a much bigger than expected rise in industrial activity in the New York region in November.\nOnly three of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average posted gains: aerospace giant Boeing by 1.3 percent, aluminum maker Alcoa by 0.7 percent and consumer products company Procter & Gamble by 0.3 percent.\nThe Dow fell as much as 139 points during the session, but late buying trimmed the loss to 57.85 points.
