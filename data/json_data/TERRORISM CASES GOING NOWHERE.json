    "full text": "WASHINGTON -- The FBI has been seeking prosecution of international terrorism cases at six times the rate it did before Sept. 11, but more than half of those cases considered by federal prosecutors never made it to court, Justice Department records show.\nIn the year before the attacks on New York and Washington, FBI agents sent 10 international terrorism cases a month to U.S. attorneys for prosecution, according to the records obtained by Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. In the first six months after the attacks, they sent 59 a month.\nThe records reflect the intense FBI focus on anti-terrorism investigations after Sept. 11, but they also show prosecutors declined to file charges in 60 of the 98 FBI anti-terrorism cases they considered from last October through March. The prosecutors did not reach a decision during the period on all of the more than 350 cases referred to them.\nIn half the cases not prosecuted, U.S. attorneys said there was a \"lack of evidence of criminal intent\" or no evidence a federal crime had been committed.\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, say they are troubled by both the high rate of declined prosecutions and the reasons prosecutors cite for not pursuing the cases.\nThe lawmakers asked Attorney General John Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert Mueller in a letter Friday to explain why so many FBI terrorism referrals are not being prosecuted.\nFBI officials say the referral of a case to a U.S. attorney is not the equivalent of an FBI recommendation for prosecution. In anti-terrorism cases in particular, the officials said, much of the effort to prevent terrorist attacks does not result in prosecutions.\nDespite assertions by Ashcroft and Mueller that the FBI was focusing more on terrorism prevention, the records show that bank robberies, drug violations and bank frauds accounted for more than a third of all FBI referrals in the first six months after Sept. 11. That's roughly the same level as in the previous five years.\nLeahy and Grassley said the FBI's continuing focus on bank robberies, drug violations and bank fraud raises \"troubling questions about whether the FBI and Department of Justice are devoting sufficient resources to counterterrorism efforts.\"\n\"Director Mueller has to put more agents on the trail of al-Qaida and other terrorists and leave the Bonnie and Clyde investigations to local authorities,\" Grassley said.\n\nLoad-Date: June 17, 2002"
