That hostage, Haruna Yukawa, was shown as purportedly killed in an earlier video.\nThe fates of Goto, 47, a freelance journalist, and the Jordanian pilot, Lt. Muath Kaseasbeh, had been linked by the militants, but Saturday's video made no mention of the airman.\nJordan's government spokesman, Mohammed al-Momani, declined to comment.\nLast week, Jordan had offered to free an al-Qaida prisoner for the pilot, but a swap never moved forward.\nSaturday's video, highlighted by militant sympathizers on social media sites, bore the symbol of the Islamic State group's al-Furqan media arm.\nThough the video could not be immediately independently verified, it conformed to other beheading videos released by the extremists, who now control about a third of both Syria and neighboring Iraq in a self-declared caliphate.\nThe video, called \"A Message to the Government of Japan,\" featured a man who looked and sounded like a militant with a British accent who has taken part in other beheading videos by the Islamic State group.\nGoto, kneeling in an orange prison jumpsuit, said nothing in the roughly one-minute-long video.\n\"Abe,\" the militant says in the video, referring to the Japanese prime minister, \"because of your reckless decision to take part in an unwinnable war, this knife will not only slaughter Kenji, but will also carry on and cause carnage wherever your people are found.\n\"So let the nightmare for Japan begin.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \n ED NOTE: GRAPHIC CONTENT - This image made from a video released by Islamic State militants on Saturday, Jan. 31, 2015, purports to show a militant standing next to Japanese journalist Kenji Goto before his beheading by the militant group.
