    "full text": "William R. Hawkins' ''Haiti revives Monroe Doctrine'' in the Oct. 26 State Journal was so full of disinformation and distortion that one hardly knows what to make of the conclusions he alleges to draw. His assertion that the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua was linked to international terrorism is completely unsubstantiated probably because it is a flat-out lie.\nMark Keating, Madison\nExactly where and when were ''hostile foreign troops'' allowed to set up bases in Nicaragua? There never were any, unless we count the American financed and trained Contras who specialized in massacring rural health workers, agronomists and innocent civilians. In touting the Roosevelt Corollary as proof of the United State's support for free elections, is the author forgetting the role the CIA played in overthrowing constitutionally elected governments in Guatemala in 1954 and Chile in 1973?\nThe stupidity and arrogance of the author's Cold War mentality would be laughable in a Dr. Strangelove sort of way were it not for the high price paid in blood by genuine freedom fighters throughout the Americas. Courageous Haitians are struggling to restore their elected leader, and when they take a policeman's bullet in the head for their effort, Hawkins' callously wonders what it all means to ''U.S. national interests.''\n\nLoad-Date: July 19, 1995"
