    "full text": "New federal rules to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism go into effect today, prompting concerns that they could undermine financial privacy.\nFor many years, banks have had systems for reporting suspicious activity that could indicate money laundering.\nNow, the first phase of the USA Patriot Act requires a broader range of financial services companies to implement anti-money-laundering programs, including mutual fund companies, credit card networks and check cashers.\nThe law is intended to protect Americans from terrorist attacks. But critics on both the left and the right say it is an ineffective way to try to stop money laundering and terrorism, at the expense of personal privacy.\nInstead of just expanding the current system to make more companies responsible for monitoring financial transactions, the government needs a better targeted money-laundering law, says J. Bradley Jansen, deputy director of the Center for Technology Policy.\nOther critics complain that banking groups are using their anti-terrorism mandate to try to dissuade states from enacting tougher financial privacy laws. \"You can have security and privacy too,\" says Ed Mierzwinski at U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\nThe Treasury Department says that it is helping honest businesses prevent corruption by money launderers and terrorists. It is for now deferring application of the law to industries such as pawnbrokers and insurance companies, while it tailors requirements to each.\n\nLoad-Date: April 24, 2002"
