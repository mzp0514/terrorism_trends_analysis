    "full text": "Leaders of the world's seven major industrial democracies wrapped up a two-day summit Monday, pledging to take  action on global problems ranging from climate change and economic  volatility to terrorism and the conflict in Ukraine.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, the host of the Group of Seven meeting, said at a wrap-up news conference that the G-7 called for an end to the use of fossil fuels by the end of the century.\nMerkel said the leaders also urged Greece to remain part of the European Union and find ways to meet budget constraints required for new loans. And they reiterated a call for continued economic sanctions against Russia until a cease fire between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists is fully honored.\nThe seven leaders -- representing the U.K., Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- met at a resort in the Bavarian mountains. Russia, which normally attends the annual meeting, was barred because of its annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula last year and backing of the separatists fighting in eastern Ukraine near the Russian border. The group also refused to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin last year, when the summit was to take place in Sochi, Russia, because of the Ukraine conflict.\nLeaders also were united in their call for Russian sanctions to remain in place.\nOn  the Islamic State's expansion in Iraq and Syria, President Obama vowed \"to get more Iraqi security forces trained, fresh, well-equipped and focused.\" \n\nGraphic\n\n \nphoto Michael Kappeler, AP\n\nLoad-Date: June 10, 2015"
