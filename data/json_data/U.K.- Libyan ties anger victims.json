The IRA used those explosives in the 1980s and '90s. \nBut Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi performed an about-face in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, renouncing terrorism, dismantling his country's secret nuclear program, and accepting his government's responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing, the 1988 attack which killed 270 people, mostly Americans. \nBrown and other government officials stressed the need to keep Libya on that route when explaining why they did not press the Libyans for compensation for the IRA's attacks. But documents released Sunday — including a letter sent from Middle East minister Bill Rammel to Jonathan Ganesh, a survivor of one of the IRA bombings — suggest that the government was also keeping Libya's vast oil wealth in mind. \n\nLoad-Date: September 7, 2009"
