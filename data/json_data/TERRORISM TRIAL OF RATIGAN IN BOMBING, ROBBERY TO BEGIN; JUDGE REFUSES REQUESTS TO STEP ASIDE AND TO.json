    "full text": "The fourth man accused of involvement in domestic terrorism last year in the Spokane Valley goes on trial today in U.S. District Court.\nBrian Ratigan is charged with the July 12 bombing at the Valley's Planned Parenthood clinic and a robbery minutes later at a nearby branch of U.S. Bank.\nThe former Army sniper wasn't with three other men - Charles Barbee, Robert Berry and Verne Jay Merrell - when they were arrested last October near Yakima after a foiled bank robbery in Portland.\nAfter their arrests, Ratigan was a fugitive for six months, living near Sandpoint and Colville under various names.\nRatigan was arrested by FBI agents March 13 at the Amtrak depot in Spokane. He was caught with a MAC-90 assault rifle and eight loaded, extra-large ammunition clips.\nThe weapon matches an assault weapon photographed by bank surveillance cameras during the robbery.\nAt a hearing Wednesday, Ratigan asked U.S. District Judge Frem Nielsen to remove himself from the case.\nHe also asked that a jury from Western Washington be picked to hear his case because of news media coverage of previous trials of Barbee, Berry and Merrell.\nThey were recently convicted of the crime spree and face mandatory life imprisonment.\n''I feel that with all the media coverage of the two prior trials, there will be no chance for me to have an impartial jury,'' Ratigan said in a letter to the judge.\nHe also said he has no faith in his court-appointed attorneys, Terry Ryan and Don Kellman.\n''I do not accept my defense counsel willingly, but feel it has been forced upon me,'' Ratigan wrote.\n''My defense is Yahweh, my Father and Creator, and Yahshua, his son, is my advocate and mediator. I acknowledge or accept no other!''\nNielsen refused to step aside or call jurors from outside the Eastern District of Washington.\nJury selection begins today. Opening statements and initial testimony are expected Friday.\n\nLoad-Date: September 19, 1997"
