    "full text": "As the parent of a Millersville University student, I am deeply disappointed and angered by Millersville University's decision to invite William Ayers to speak on campus.\nThis event is an insult to the social and moral fiber of Lancaster County and the American people. On a personal level, I am experiencing a moral quandary realizing the tuition checks allocated to educate my daughter will, in part, be used to facilitate the work of an individual who practiced terrorism.\nLet us be reminded that the bedrock of the Lancaster County area is the conservative and traditional lifestyles practiced by the majority of its residents. Bringing an individual such as Bill Ayers into this community is a direct contradiction to both the values and lifestyles of the Lancaster County area.\nIt is not necessary to reiterate the credentials of Mr. Ayers or the hardships he has caused our fellow countrymen. However, it bears repeating that an individual such as Mr. Ayers should not be given the opportunity to impress the minds of the next generation or any generation to come.\nIf we allow this, we are indeed educating and encouraging our children to foster the seeds of terrorism in their vulnerable, developing minds.\nI suggest the university should evaluate the honest \"bottom line\" of bringing Mr. Ayers to Lancaster County and Millersville University.\nIn the spirit of America - our values, our future and our decency - I beg Millersville University to make the wise and prudent decision to cancel the speaking engagement of Bill Ayers.\n\nLoad-Date: March 15, 2009"
