    "full text": "AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - When a man fueled by rage against the U.S. government and its tax code crashes his airplane into a building housing offices of the Internal Revenue Service, is it a criminal act or an act of terrorism?\nFor police in Austin, it's a question tied to the potential for public alarm: The building set ablaze by Joseph Stack's suicide flight was still burning Thursday afternoon when officials confidently stood before reporters and said the crash wasn't terrorism.\nBut others, including those in the Muslim community, look at Stack's actions and fail to understand how he differs from foreign perpetrators of political violence who are routinely labeled terrorists.\n\"The position of many individuals and institutions seems to be that no act of violence can be labeled 'terrorism' unless it is carried out by a Muslim,\" said Nihad Awad, director of the Washington-based Council on Islamic-American Relations.\nWithin hours of Thursday's crash, which several witnesses said stirred memories of the Sept. 11 attacks, both federal and local law enforcement officials, along with the White House, said it did not appear to be an act of terror.\nYet, Stratfor, an Austin-based global intelligence firm specializing in international risk management, said the rhetoric in Stack's online rant clearly matches the USA Patriot Act's definition of terrorism: a criminal act that is intended to \"intimidate or coerce a civilian population to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or to affect the conduct of a government by assassination or kidnapping.\"\n\nLoad-Date: February 22, 2010"
