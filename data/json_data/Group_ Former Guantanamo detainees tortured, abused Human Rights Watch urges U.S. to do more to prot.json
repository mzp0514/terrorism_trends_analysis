    "full text": "Russian law enforcement agencies have tortured three former Guantanamo inmates and subjected them and four others to continual harassment and abuse, a U.S.-based rights group said in a report Thursday.\nHuman Rights Watch urged the United States to do more to protect the rights of terrorism suspects subject to extradition, saying it should not transfer people to countries where they may be tortured.\nAllison Gill, Moscow director for the rights group, said three of seven men who were released from the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay in 2004 have been beaten and tortured. All have suffered from detention and other forms of harassment by authorities, especially from the Interior Ministry and the Federal Security Service, she said.\nThe report said four have been forced into hiding.\nRussia's Interior Ministry declined to comment on the accusations. The Federal Security Service, the KGB's main successor agency, also refused immediate comment.\nOne of the former detainees, Rasul Kudayev, has been held in custody in the North Caucasus city of Nalchik on charges of participating in the October 2005 attack by hundreds of militants on police and government buildings. Kudayev's lawyers and relatives say he was beaten while in custody to extract confessions and a regional court has ordered prosecutors to probe those allegations.\nKudayev's mother Fatima Tekayeva told The Associated Press in a phone interview that her son was repeatedly beaten. \"I saw traces of the beatings on his body with my own eyes,\" she said.\nTwo others, Ravil Gumarov and Timur Ishmuratov, were sentenced last year to sentences of 13 and 11 years, respectively, for blowing up a natural gas pipeline after having been acquitted in an earlier trial.\n\nLoad-Date: April 10, 2007"
