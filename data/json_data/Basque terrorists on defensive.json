    "full text": "Basque terrorism seems to have been defeated.\nFrench police stormed a villa near Bayonne in southwestern France over the weekend and captured Philippe Bidart, leader of the French Basque separatist organization Iparretarrek, along with four accomplices.\nAt the same time, the Spanish government confirmed that it is working to negotiate the surrender of the isolated Spanish Basque separatist organization, ETA (an acronym for Basque Homeland and Liberty).\nCooperation between France and Spain has put the terrorists on the defensive. For years, France offered refuge to Basque nationalists it said were persecuted by the authoritarian regime of Gen. Francisco Franco.\nBut Spain now is a democracy and attitudes have changed.\nFrench police work with their Spanish counterparts, helping them track down suspected terrorists. Suspected ETA members regularly are extradited and suspected French sympathizers are jailed.\nIn Spain, Basque separatism and terrorism took deep roots during Franco's oppressive reign. As revenge for the Basques' support of the Republic during the Spanish civil war, Franco outlawed the Basque language and banned public meetings. The Basques responded in 1959 by creating ETA.\nBy contrast, Spain's new democratic rulers have moved to satisfy the aspirations of Basques, who mainly inhabit a region west of the Pyrenees, along the French-Spanish border. A decade ago, they granted Basques a large degree of autonomy, including powers over taxation, television, and education. For the first time, the most radical Basque party, Herri Batasuna, agreed last year in a parliamentary vote to come out and condemn terrorism.\nETA, whose independence campaign has taken nearly 600 lives, found itself isolated. On Jan. 29, the group offered a 60-day partial truce if the Spanish government agreed to resume contact with members of its leadership exiled in Algeria. What was novel in ETA's statement, most experts agree, was its offer to halt the violence without obtaining any prior commitments from the Madrid government.\nAt first, Madrid hesitated. Authorities were angered by a particularly nasty ETA car bombing in December which killed 12 people in a civil guard barracks in Saragossa.\nGovernment spokesman Javier Solana said that the decision to accept the ETA offer was taken ''in the light of the fact that there have been no killings'' in the past few weeks.\nIn France, Basque separatism always has been less of a threat than in Spain. French Basque lands are smaller and less populated than Spanish Basque lands; French Basques integrated into France and even gave France its familiar cap - the beret. ''We're French first,'' says Guy Chardiet, tourism director in St. Jean de Luz. ''We eat Camembert and baguettes, too.''\nIn this Francophile atmosphere, analysts agree violence never enjoyed widespread local support although Iparretarrek began in the 1970s as an ETA offshoot. Members helped their Spanish compatriots. Their own actions remained symbolic - actions such as sabatoging the Tour de France bicycling race.\nNo one was hurt until 1982 when two terrorists were killed by their own bomb. An attempted kidnap in 1982 ended in the murder of two police officers. French Basque leader Bidart was convicted last year of this crime in absentia and as a result was sentenced to life in prison.\n''This is a big step in dismantling a terrorist network,'' Security Minister Robert Pandraud said after Mr. Bidart's arrest. ''I believe Ipparretarak will have a hard time regrouping and starting over.''\nA larger lesson may be gleaned from this success. Two years ago, an international team of security experts studied the Basque problem and concluded in a 250-page report that Basque terrorism could be beaten by a combination of politics and policing.\nOn the one hand, the experts said that political causes behind the violence must be addressed through negotiations with ETA. On the other hand, police should put pressure on the terrorists ''to show that violence has no chance of succeeding,'' according to Jacques Leaute, one of the report's authors.\nBy opening negotiations with ETA, the Spanish government has followed these recommendations. Reports from Madrid suggest it may even be prepared to make further concessions on Basque autonomy - but not on independence - in order to silence ETA.\nBut Mr. Leaute is optimistic about ending the Basque threat.\n''Basques share Spanish ethnicity and the Catholic religion,'' he concluded. ''Basque demands can be reconciled in today's Spain.''\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPicture, San Sebastian: Spaniard walks by railing post that is adorned with Basque graffiti, R. NORMAN MATHENY - STAFF"
