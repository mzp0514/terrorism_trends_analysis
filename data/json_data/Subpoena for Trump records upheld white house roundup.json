He declared it would amount to an \"undue expansion\" of presidential immunity to grant Trump's request to quash the subpoena.\nDon't expect to see Trump's 1040s anytime soon, despite the ruling. Even if Vance obtains the documents, he would be bound by grand jury secrecy to keep them under wraps.\nTrump criticized the ruling as a continuation of \"the greatest witch hunt in history,\" his go-to description of the various investigations of his alleged wrongdoing.\nJay Sekulow, the president's lawyer, said they will appeal the ruling. It came after the Supreme Court turned away the president's claim of \"absolute immunity\" from an investigation, but ordered a new hearing on other issues.\nThe president said he interprets the Supreme Court ruling as backing his claim that the subpoena is invalid.\nThe subpoena is related to Vance's probe of \"alleged insurance and bank fraud by the Trump Organization and its officers,\" along with hush-money payments to women to cover up Trump's alleged affairs.\nTrump's lawyers said that the request for tax records dating back to 2011 was retaliatory after the president's company, the Trump Organization, disputed the scope of a subpoena seeking records from 2015 to 2018.\nU.S. formally demands\nfull Iran sanctions restored\nUNITED NATIONS - The Trump administration on Thursday formally notified the United Nations of its demand for all U.N. sanctions on Iran to be restored, setting off an immediate confrontation with Russia and other Security Council members, including America's European allies, who called the U.S. move illegal.\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered the notification to the president of the U.N. Security Council, citing significant Iranian violations of the 2015 nuclear deal, a requirement to \"snap back\" U.N. sanctions.\n\"The United States will never allow the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism to freely buy and sell planes, tanks, missiles and other kinds of conventional weapons ... (or) to have a nuclear weapon,\" Pompeo told a U.N. press conference.\nFrom wire reports\n\nLoad-Date: August 21, 2020"
