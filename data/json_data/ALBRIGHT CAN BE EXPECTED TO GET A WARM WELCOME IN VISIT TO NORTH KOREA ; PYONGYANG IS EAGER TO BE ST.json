So Washington's Cold War-era foe is sure to lavish pomp and protocol on Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on a visit to North Korea this week.\nAlbright, who leaves for Pyongyang on Sunday, will likely be treated to orderly crowds of well-wishers, theater performances and toasts and handshakes with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. These images of rapprochement could lead to a visit by President Bill Clinton next month.\nBut there will also be blunt talk of the communist North's missile program and its desire to get off a U.S. list of terrorism-sponsoring nations - issues that have stalled hopes for permanent peace on the Korean peninsula since it was devastated by war 50 years ago.\nBoth sides declared their intent to \"formally end the Korean War\" by resolving these quandaries in a joint statement that was released in Washington during a trip this month by Gen. Jo Myong Rok, a top aide to Kim Jong Il.\nThe two sides might wait before tackling other complex topics, such as troop reductions and weapon withdrawals from the Demilitarized Zone, a buffer zone separating the two Koreas.\n\"These are very tough. It's going to take a while to work out. Now the North is saying it's time to start,\" said Leon Sigal, author of the book \"Disarming Strangers: Nuclear Diplomacy with North Korea.\"\nThe Albright visit is part of a coordinated strategy involving Washington and its allies, South Korea and Japan, to end the North's isolation and remove the threat of war in one of the world's most volatile regions.\nSouth Korean President Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong Il set the stage for reconciliation by pledging at a summit meeting in June to pursue reunification. Kim Dae-jung won the Nobel Peace Prize last week for his peace efforts.\nMeanwhile, Japan plans talks with North Korea in Beijing on Oct. 30 and 31 following two rounds held earlier this year.\nEurope is also responding to North Korea's attempts to shed its image as a pariah state and attract international aid to revive its economy and stave off food shortages. Britain and Germany plan to open diplomatic relations soon.\nAlbright's meetings Monday and Tuesday in Pyongyang may serve as an opportunity for the North to publicly clarify its stand on the 37,000 U.S. soldiers based in South Korea.\nKim Dae-jung has said that Kim Jong Il acknowledged at their meeting that the U.S. armed forces could play a role in Korea as guarantors of regional security even after reunification. There are fears in South Korea that the removal of U.S. forces could destabilize the balance of power in Asia by emboldening Japan and China.\nA deal appears close on removing North Korea from Washington's terrorism list, which bars all but humanitarian aid to the Pyongyang government and forbids other economic benefits.\nThis month, Pyongyang met a U.S. condition for getting off the list by issuing a joint statement with Washington renouncing all forms of terrorism.\nNorth Korea was put on the list because of involvement in the bombing of a South Korean airliner near Burma, now Myanmar, in 1987, that killed all 115 people on board.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO Photo by THE ASSOCIATED PRESS - South Koreans protest Friday against globalization.
