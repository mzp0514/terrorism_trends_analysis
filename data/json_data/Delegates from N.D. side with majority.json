John Hoeven, R-N.D., said in a statement Wednesday.\nThe Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act amends a 1976 law granting other countries immunity from American lawsuits. The bill initially passed the Senate on May 17 and the House on Sept. 9. President Barack Obama vetoed the bill on Friday.\n\"No family member who has lost a loved one to terrorism should be denied their right to seek justice, regardless of whether the perpetrator is a government or a country,\" Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., said in a statement.\nThe Senate veto override vote was 97-1, and the House vote was 348-77.\n\"Today's veto override by Congress is a strong affirmation of accountability and justice. Fifteen years later, it gives the victims and their families of the 9/11 attacks another avenue to seek justice and have their day in court,\" Rep. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said in a statement.\nReach Jessica Holdman at 701-250-8261 or jessica.holdman@bismarcktribune.com\n\nLoad-Date: September 29, 2016"
