    "full text": "Communication during a natural disaster is shifting to digital platforms, most notably social sites such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.\nAccording to a December report, \"Social Media Use During Disasters,\" by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, or START, Internet usage on the East Coast saw a 114 percent spike on the first day of Hurricane Sandy.\nAdditionally, Twitter saw 1.1 million tweets mentioning the word \"hurricane\" for 21 hours during Hurricane Sandy between Oct. 29 and 30. Ultimately classified as a superstorm, it became the No. 2 most talked about topic on Facebook for all of 2012.\nThe public turns to online communities during disasters because of the need to know the latest developments. Social media is a convenient source for exchanging new information quickly, since it can be accessed via desktop computer, tablet and mobile devices.\nSocial networks also offer disaster victims a way to connect with family and friends. Further, they can become platforms that contribute to a sense of community and help mobilize relief efforts.\nIn its report, START cautions about some of the drawbacks of seeking information on the Internet during emergency situations, including the distribution of inaccurate information and the overwhelming volume of information distributed on social networks.\nThe Tampa Bay Times is here to help.\nWhen disaster strikes, you can turn to tampabay.com and the Tampa Bay Times on social media as a reliable source of weather and road conditions, disaster relief, shelter information, on the scene reports and more.\nIn a time of disaster, the Timesbrings Florida residents accurate information that is useful and makes sense of everything being shared across the Web.\nWe encourage our readers to connect with us for information and to share with us to help tell the story.
