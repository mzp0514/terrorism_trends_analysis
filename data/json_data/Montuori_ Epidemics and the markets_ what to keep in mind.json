    "full text": "Our country and the stock market are very resilient.  There are many factors that can impact the stock market:  election, war, terrorism, economics, greed, fear etc. \nCurrently fear is impacting the stock market, perhaps fueled by the media. Fear can be a great motivator and protector but the strong emotion oftentimes isn’t great for your portfolio. \nThis is certainly not the first time we’ve had a real health scare that has influenced the stock market. \nHIV -80’s, pneumonic plague-90’s, Bird Flu, and SARS in the 2000’s and Zika in most recent memory.  The good news is that six months after the epidemic, the S&P 500 Index was up 11 of the 12 cases.  Twelve months after, it was positive 9 out of 11 times with an average return of +13.6%.  We believe that tells us not to panic and to stay the course.  \nLuck favors the prepared. Prior to this or any other catalyst that can railroad your portfolio, you should be prepared. Have an asset allocation of stocks and safety that is suitable and is congruent with your comfort level.  Ask yourself whether you have enough time (5-10 years +) and can you afford the risk. \nDo you have the constitution to stomach the volatility?  Discuss all this with your financial advisor prior to and during these times.  This should prepare you and your family to keep you on the right track. \nMichael Montuori is First Vice President  Investment Officer for Wells Fargo Advisors, in Woodbury. \n\nCopyright © 2020 BridgeTower Media.
