That time he was detained on suspicion of fraud.\nThe legislation outlaws secession, subversion, terrorism and collision with foreign forces to intervene in Hong Kong's internal affairs.\nAccording to a Bloomberg report, Haze Fan was seen being escorted from her apartment building by plain clothes security officials on Monday, shortly after she had been in contact with one of her editors. The outspoken critic of Beijing faces the prospect of extradition to China and life in prison under the sweeping national security law the country imposed last summer.\nFKA twigs Accuses Shia LaBeouf of Sexual Battery and Assault in Lawsuit\nHe then began strangling her with his hands, whispering, \"if you don't stop you are going to lose me\", according to the suit.

In addition, he faces charges for his involvement in an unauthorized June vigil commemorating the anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown.\n\nLoad-Date: December 12, 2020"
