    "full text": "Lagos, Nov. 16 -- House of Representatives has passed into second reading a bill for an Act to make provision for the offences relating to terrorism, prohibit the financing of terrorism and consolidate all acts relating to terrorism and other related matters.\nAlso the bill seeks to checkmate terrorism and afford Nigerians the opportunity to join the committee of nations in the fight against terrorism.\nIt would be recalled that the Terrorism Act, 2011 did not contemplate the financing of terrorism in Nigeria which the amended Act of 2013 provided for.\nSponsoring the bill, Honourable Mohammed Monguno Tuesday at the plenary explained that the bill criminalises international terrorism, funds supporting the Officialterrorism and seizure of terrorist cash and property.\nThe bill contemplates dealing with charities linked to terrorist groups as well as request from foreign states and to foreign states on extradition of persons involved in terrorist activities.\nHonourable Nnenna Ukeje (PDP, Abia State) in her contribution added that in ensuring the passage of the bill, treaties between Nigeria and other countries and the aspect regarding human right should also be considered.\nOther members unanimously agreed that capital punishment be included in the bill as imprisonment for offenders was not enough to serve as deterrent.\nHowever, the passage of the bill enables a single Act addressing all the concerns in the Acts and the new situations not contemplated beyond the present. It will also ease consultation and referencing in terms of terrorism law in the country.\nPublished by HT Syndication with permission from National Mirror.
