Pelletreau    Jr.       \nCompiled from Wire Reports\"It was a step in the right direction,\" Arafat said of the    90-minute meeting, the first between U.S. and PLO officials in more    than 13 years.\n \n     Arafat said the PLO's aim at future meetings will be to convince    the Americans, and through them the Israelis, to work for a United    Nations-sponsored peace conference on the Middle East.\n \n     Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said he was shocked by    Washington's decision to open a dialogue with the PLO and cautioned    that the move is straining the U.S.-Israeli alliance.\n \n     A PLO official said Saturday that the United States put forward    three points for discussion at the meeting - terrorism, direct    negotiations and how the dialogue should proceed.\n \n     The PLO raised the killing of its military commander, Abu Jihad, in    April and of four Palestinians in Nablus on Friday. It called these    examples of Israeli state terrorism and asked Washington to clarify its    position on such acts.\n \n    \n\nLoad-Date: November 12, 1992"
