    "full text": "In a meeting Tuesday, the United States, its six principal industrialized allies and Russia formally adopted 25 measures designed to combat terrorism.\nThe meeting was the third international conclave on terrorism in four months.\nIt was held amid intensive investigations into Saturday's bomb blast at Olympic Centennial Park in Atlanta, which led to two deaths, and into the July 17 explosion aboard TWA Flight 800, which killed all 230 persons aboard.\nLike its predecessors, the five-hour conference ended in a show of unity against terrorists and the states that support them.\nThe closing of ranks Tuesday followed a U.S. decision not to press President Bill Clinton's demands for \"strong sanctions\" against governments accused of sponsoring terrorism. With France and Germany in the forefront, the principal allies of the United States have openly opposed U.S. efforts to enforce new economic and other sanctions against Iran, Iraq, Libya and the Sudan.\nRegardless, Peter Tarnoff, undersecretary of state for political affairs, said the measures would \"send a very strong message, not only to terrorists around the world but to states around the world that support and harbor terrorists.\"\nThe measures adopted Tuesday included:\nTightening controls on firearms and explosives.\nPreventing terrorist use of the Internet.\nImproving bomb detection methods for airplanes.\nThwarting terrorist financing.\nThe participants also called for developing extradition treaties and faster international exchanges on terrorists, including terrorist use of chemical, biological and nuclear materials.\nThe measures closely resembled those circulated in an informal working paper in Lyon, France, last month at the annual meeting of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries.\nKey details agreed to Tuesday were left for experts to work out.\n\nLoad-Date: August 1, 1996"
