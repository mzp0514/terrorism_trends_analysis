    "full text": "More than 200 high schools and colleges across the nation participated in YAF’s 9/11: Never Forget project to commemorate the lives murdered on September 11, 2001 by radical Islamic terrorists. Each school placed 2,977 American flags into the ground to remind their peers of the loss our nation suffered on that tragic day.\nWithout these brave student activists, many schools would ignore this anniversary or promote a politically correct version of what happened 18 years ago today.\nYoung America’s Foundation created the 9/11: Never Forget Project in 2003 to help students create meaningful memorials to the innocent victims of radical Islamic terrorism, and to inspire commitment to defending our freedoms whenever they are attacked. Since its inception, more than 11 million American flags have been placed in displays across the nation.\nSee below for live updates from across the country as students take part in the largest nationwide campus activism project!\nBuchanan High School\nCanisius College\nClemson University\nCollege of Saint Benedict and Saint Johns University\nEdison High School\nFranciscan University\nGeorge Mason University\nGeorge Washington University\nGuerin Catholic High School\nHobart and William Smith Colleges\nIndiana University\nIowa State University\nLake Forest High School\nLouisiana State University\nMartin Luther High School\nMichigan State University\nMississippi State University\nRadford University\nRocky Mountain College\nStetson University\nSUNY Maritime\nTexas Tech University\nTrinity Classical Academy\nUniversity of Alabama\nUniversity of Cincinnati \nUniversity of Florida\nUniversity of Michigan\nUniversity of North Carolina-Wilmington\nUniversity of Notre Dame\nUniversity of Redlands\nUniversity of Texas- Austin\nUrbana High School\nVirginia Tech\nWalter Payton College Prep School\n \n \n\nLoad-Date: September 12, 2019"
