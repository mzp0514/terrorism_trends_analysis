    "full text": "A federal appeals court yesterday rejected an attempt by prosecutors to oust a judge from a terrorism case, dismissing the government's argument that the judge, Shira A. Scheindlin, was biased in favor of the defendant.\n  The ruling came in the case of Osama Awadallah, a Jordanian college student who was charged in October 2001 with lying before a grand jury to conceal his ties with two hijackers in the Sept. 11 attacks.\n According to court documents, Mr. Awadallah was arrested in California as a material witness and held in solitary confinement for 20 days before he went before the Manhattan grand jury. His convoluted case has become a test of the government's prolonged detention of people without charges as material witnesses in terrorism cases.\n  A panel of three judges from the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that Judge Scheindlin, of Federal District Court in Manhattan, had not erred in several rulings she made about evidence in the case, and they praised her ''intellectual flexibility'' in resolving some thorny legal matters. The appeals judges noted that in several cases in which Judge Scheindlin had initially antagonized the prosecutors by questioning their procedures, she ultimately ruled in their favor.\n  This case is the first since 1973 in which federal prosecutors in Manhattan have sought the ouster of a judge. They were denied in that case as well.\n  Mr. Awadallah, now 25, has not been accused of any direct role in the 9/11 attacks. A jury was selected, and his trial was set to begin in May, but Judge Scheindlin postponed it because of the prosecutors' appeals.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: January 26, 2006"
