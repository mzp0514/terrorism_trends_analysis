Rumack, director of tax and legal services at Buck.\n\"While the terrorism risk in the U.S. might appear to be remote, it is still very important that all companies review their benefit plans to determine exactly what their insurance policies cover and what action they will take if a loss occurs,\" Mr. Rumack said.\nThe results of Buck's survey, \"Operation Desert Storm -- War and Terrorism Exclusions in Benefit Plans,\" are based on a phone survey of 56 Fortune 1,000 companies conducted shortly after the Persian Gulf war began.\nNot all companies answered all questions on the survey, which was released last week.\nTwenty-three companies --or 41% -- of the 56 survey respondents said they have checked to determine whether benefits plans exclude both war- and terrorism-related losses.\nSeventeen respondents, or 30.4%, said they checked their plans only for war exclusions, while two others said they checked only for terrorism exclusions.\nThe survey found that among survey respondents':\n* Accidental death and dismemberment plans, 26 of 53 -- or 49% -- contained war exclusions, and eight of 49 -- or 16% -- contained terrorism exclusions.\n* Group health plans, 19 of 52 -- or 37% -- contained war exclusions, and seven of 48 -- or 15% -- contained terrorism exclusions.\n* Long-term disability plans, 18 of 52 -- or 35% -- contained war exclusions, and six of 48 -- or 13% -- contained terrorism exclusions.\n* Business travel accident plans, 17 of 53 -- or 32% -- contained war exclusions, and seven of 49 -- or 14% -- contained terrorism exclusions.\n* Short-term disability plans, 15 of 52 -- or 29% -- contained war exclusions, and five of 47 -- or 11% -- contained terrorism exclusions.\n* Group term life plans, 12 of 53 -- or 23% -- contained war exclusions, and five of 49 -- or 10% -- contained terrorism exclusions.\n* Group universal life plans, three of 52 -- or 6% -- contained war exclusions, and one of 48 -- or 2% -- contained terrorism exclusions.\nHowever, the survey noted: \"On the issue of terrorism, many organizations don't know if plans have an exclusion, either because the issue had not been sufficiently addressed or because in reviewing the plans this was found to be an 'extremely gray area.'\"\nAmong 37 companies that responded when asked whether they would compensate an employee for a war or terrorism loss excluded from a plan, 18 -- or 49% -- said they would not be compensated; eight -- or 22% -- said they would be conmpensated; and 11 -- or 30% -- were undecided.\nFifteen of 52 responding companies, or 28.8%, have implemented special travel policies because of the threat of terrorism, the survey found.\nFourteen employers have restricted international travel -- with six employers prohibiting all international travel -- and five employers have restricted domestic travel -- with two firms restricting all such travel, the survey found.\n\"My own sense is . . . the insurance claim would be the least\" of employers' concerns if an employee were injured or killed while on a business trip, said Henry von Wodtke, a benefit consultant with Buck.  \"They're restricting (travel) where they can, because they don't want to have employee losses.\"\nThe survey also found that eight -- or 14.5% -- of 55 companies said they are providing \"additional assistance programs to employees who are troubled by the crisis in the Middle East.\"\nHowever, none of those respondents developed an EAP specifically because of the war."
