Of those stops, only 553 ended with an arrest. That means in four out of five stops where a weapon was drawn, no arrest was made.\nUntil now, the NYPD has released only limited information on why, where and how its officers stop and question citizens suspected of unlawful activity. Use-of-force details have never been made public.\nThey surfaced in internal data the NYPD turned over to researchers at the University of Michigan. In recent days, researchers posted much of the information on the Web.\nThe use-of-force statistics offer a more detailed picture of the NYPD's increased use of police stops to combat crime. Civil liberties groups concerned about illegal police stops have sued to obtain all the data.\n\"The data confirms our worst fears,\" said Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. \"The NYPD is stopping, interrogating and searching hundreds of thousands of innocent New Yorkers.\"\nIn all police stops, the officer must have what's called \"probable cause\" to legally stop and question a person. That usually means the cops have information about a subject, are investigating a crime nearby or witness suspicious behavior.\nThe data reveal a wide variety of reasons to justify a stop, ranging from suspected terrorism to rent gouging.\nTerrorism was the reason given for stopping and questioning citizens in 301 cases in 2006. Only one of the \"terrorism\" stops resulted in an arrest.\nThe actual charge in that case remains a mystery - all arrest details were erased from the data.\nThe most common reason for stopping and questioning a citizen in 2006 was suspicion the person was carrying a weapon. That was the justification 114,000 times.\nOther reasons were more unusual. Twice, for instance, \"adultery\" was offered as justification for a police stop. Once it was \"rent gouging.\"\nThe data also revealed that more than 2,000 senior citizens were stopped.\nblesser@nydailynews.com\nGraphic: ARRESTING STATISTICS\nThe \"use-of-force\" data break down like this (in many cases more than one type of force was used):\n506,491 police stops\n102,454 police stops involving \"use of force\"\n2,736 stops in which police drew their weapons. In most of those stops - 1,889 - cops pointed their weapon at the suspect.\n16,667 stops where cops threw a suspect to the ground.\n2,034 where cops threw a suspect against a wall.\n86,293 stops in which officers used their hands to physically restrain a suspect.\nSOURCE: NYPD internal data, 2006\n\nGraphic\n\n \nGRAPHIC\n\nLoad-Date: June 14, 2008"
