    "full text": "The largest council of Islamic legal scholars in America issued a fatwa, an edict or religious ruling, against terrorism in light of the recent attacks in London and Egypt.\nThe Fiqh Council of North America, which includes leading Muslim scholars from diverse sects, including Sunni and Shia, issued the ruling Thursday and is targeting its message to young Muslims to clarify where the religion stands on terrorism.\nAhmed Bedier, spokesman for Central Florida's Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the statement clears up any misconceptions.\n\"This is documentation to Muslims that terrorism is clearly forbidden,\" he said. \"There is no gray area. ... This can counter any radicalism that someone may have.\"\nSome have criticized Muslims for not coming out sooner to condemn terrorist attacks.\nTo combat the criticism, CAIR produced public service announcements railing against the violence, calling it un-Islamic. After the Sept. 11 attacks and the rash of beheadings in Iraq, CAIR issued statements against the acts.\nAfter the London bombings, Muslim scholars in Europe issued the fatwa, and American Muslim scholars followed suit. CAIR, which is not a religious organization, is backing the Muslim council's edict.\nChris Echegaray\nCopyright Â© 2005, The Tampa Tribune and may not be republished without permission.
