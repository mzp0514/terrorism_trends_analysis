Meantime, China considers Taiwan a renegade province and has hinted it might boycott the Games if Taiwanese political leaders are invited. Payne said no political leaders have been specifically invited.\nPayne also said a drug-testing machine considered three times more effective than standard equipment will be used at this summer's Games. The high resolution mass spectrometer can detect steroid use up to three months previously.\n\nNotes\n\nOLYMPICS\n\nLoad-Date: March 9, 1996"
