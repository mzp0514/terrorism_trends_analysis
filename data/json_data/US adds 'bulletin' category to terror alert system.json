An elevated alert warns of \"a credible terrorism threat\" while an imminent alert advises the public of a \"credible, specific and impending terrorism threat.\"\nThe change is designed to provide a more flexible way for federal authorities to communicate the existence of potential threats. This is the first change to the National Terrorism Advisory System since it replaced the color-coded system in 2011.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson discusses the updates to the National Terrorism Advisory System (NTAS), Wednesday, Dec. 16, 2015, at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) National Response Coordination Center in Washington.
