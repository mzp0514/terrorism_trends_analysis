The program began shortly after the September 2001 terrorist attacks, but most of the records are purged every five years.\nThe NSA's collection of American phone metadata has been deeply controversial ever since Snowden disclosed it to journalists in 2013.\nObama sought, and Congress passed, a law ending the collection and instead allowing the NSA to request the records from phone companies as needed in terrorism investigations.\nThat still left the question of what to do about the records already in the database.\nOn Monday, the Director of National Intelligence said in a statement that those records would no longer be examined in terrorism investigations after Nov. 29 and would be destroyed as soon as possible.\nThe records can't be purged at the moment because the NSA is being sued over them, the statement said.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n FILE - In this June 6, 2013, file photo, a sign stands outside the National Security Administration (NSA) campus on in Fort Meade, Md.
