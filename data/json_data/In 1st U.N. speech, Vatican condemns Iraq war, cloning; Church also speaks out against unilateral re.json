    "full text": "The Vatican, in its first speech ever to the U.N. General Assembly, called Wednesday for a total ban on human cloning and criticized the war in Iraq and unilateral responses to terrorism.\nArchbishop Giovanni Lajolo, secretary of the Holy See's relations with states, spoke in broad terms and didn't mention the U.S.-led coalition that invaded Iraq or the nations that have acted unilaterally against terrorists.\nHe referred to Pope John Paul II's fervent opposition to the Iraq war.\n\"Everyone can see that it (military action) did not lead to a safer world, either inside or outside Iraq,\" he said as the assembly's two-week annual ministerial session neared an end.\nHe stressed, however, that it is imperative to support Iraq's new government in bringing normalcy and democracy to the country.\nRegarding terrorism worldwide, the archbishop said nations must work together to tackle the growing scourge.\n\"It seems obvious that terrorism can only be effectively challenged through a concerted multilateral approach â€¦ and not through the politics of unilateralism,\" he said.\nThe fight against terrorism requires long-term action against terrorism's underlying causes, Lajolo said, adding that the Roman Catholic Church aids in that work by promoting mutual understanding among religions.\n\nLoad-Date: September 30, 2004"
