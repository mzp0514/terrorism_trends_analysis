    "full text": "The Carter Administration announced today that it had decided to forbid the sale of five Boeing jets to Iraq because of that country's apparent involvement in recent terrorist incidents.\nThe State Department statement also indicated that the ''clear sentiment'' of Congress against the projected $200 million sale played a role in the decision.\nAN-A\nIraq Airlines, which already has about a dozen Boeing jets, recently asked to buy two Boeing 747 jumbo jets and three 727's, a smaller plane.  Initially, the projected sale won support from the Commerce Department and from the State Department, which has been trying to improve relations with Iraq, a Persian Gulf state.\n \nAnti-terrorist Law Applies\nUnder the terms of an antiterrorist law passed by Congress three years ago, President Carter last December named Iraq, Libya, Southern Yemen and Syria as countries that ''have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.'' Once a country is so designated, the Export Administration Act requires that special scrutiny be given to sales of aircraft and that Congress be notified before sales are permitted. The consultation with Congress took place in recent weeks.\nIn the last few months Iraqi diplomats have been involved in attempted bomb attacks in Vienna and West Berlin."
