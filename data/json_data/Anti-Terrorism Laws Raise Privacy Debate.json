    "full text": "The anti-terrorism legislation being debated by Congress will have little impact on credit unions, except to require some more vigilance in spotting suspicious financial activity. That is already required of credit unions and banks. But it has succeeded in reshaping the debate over privacy.\nAfter all, who among us would object to the government snooping into our private affairs if it would have meant early detection, and potential prevention, of the tragic attacks on Sept. 11. I know I wouldn't.\nAs a result, the debate over privacy rights no longer centers on the sharing of your confidential financial and medical information with third-party vendors. The debate has now been widened to include the disclosure of your private information to government agencies as part of the war on terrorists.\nThose privacy rights advocates that worry about \"Big Brother\" invading your computer records to determine potential threats have been put on the defensive because of the new panic over domestic attacks. That includes representatives from both the right and the left. It's hard to argue against government powers to view your private records when thousands of lives may be at stake.\nCredit Union Journal Washington Bureau Chief Ed Roberts can be reached at robertscuj@aol.\n\nhttps://www.americanbanker.com/creditunions/news/anti-terrorism-laws-raise-privacy-debate\n\nLoad-Date: August 27, 2020"
