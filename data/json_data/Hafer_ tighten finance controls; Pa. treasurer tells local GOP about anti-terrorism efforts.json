The money has been recovered through banks' insurance.\nThe perpetrators used financial codes indicating that they either have inside information or someone working in Pennsylvania government, Hafer said. And all the names on the bogus checks were Arabic.\nHafer said she doesn't know yet whether the money scam is connected to terrorism. But the \"sophisticated scheme\" means new precautions have to be taken, she said.\nPresident George W. Bush has announced a freeze on terrorist assets and creation of a Foreign Terrorist Asset Tracking Center to identify their sources of money.\nHafer sent a letter Wednesday to members of the National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers and Treasurers -- she is the association's president -- asking them to join the \"financial war against global terrorism.\"\nShe wants states to divest \"all investments of our states' treasuries and pension funds in businesses, financial institutions, governments, nonprofit entities and individuals who in any way support terrorism.\"\nHafer's speech was her second trip to the county in the last two weeks.\nShe had been battling state Attorney General Mike Fisher for Republican support in next year's gubernatorial primary, although Fisher had been picking up the early endorsements.\nThen Gov. Tom Ridge accepted Bush's call to take over a new homeland security office in the wake of the terror attacks, and Lt.  Gov. Mark Schweiker, who had dropped out of the 2002 governor's race, suddenly became a player.\nHafer said Friday she has encouraged Schweiker to run, although Schweiker seemed to take himself out of the game Saturday by telling the Republican State Committee that he would \"not be a candidate anytime soon.\"\nIf Schweiker, who shares a conservative base with Fisher, ran, he conceivably could siphon support from Fisher and give Hafer, who's more of a moderate Republican, a better shot at the nomination.\nRegardless of political aspirations, Hafer said, Schweiker will have her support as he finishes Ridge's term.\n\"I wish him well,\" she said.\nMoney matters\nAnother round of campaign expense reports was filed last week, and these were notable more for what wasn't in them than for what was.\nMissing from the county Republicans' list of contributors were the names of John Barley and Paul Thibault.\nSources say Barley and Thibault (through the political action committee he founded, Friends of Better Government) aren't giving money to the GOP these days.\nBarley's campaign committee, Friends of John Barley, has given $6,000 to the county Republicans since the beginning of the year -- and nothing in the latest reporting period. Last year, Barley's committee donated more than $24,000.\nFriends of Better Government, which gave $2,650 last year, so far has contributed nothing in 2001.\nInsiders speculate a critical factor in the funding drop is hard feelings over Votergate, the voter registration drive that ended in criminal charges against GOP chairman Chet Beiler.\nBeiler had been telling Republicans privately that Barley proposed and funded the piece-rate voter drive in the city, which Attorney General Fisher later ruled was a violation of the state election law.\nIn reports covering June 5 to Sept. 17, the county GOP reported raising $28,922, spending $41,935 and finishing with a balance of $17,607.\nThe GOP listed one unpaid debt, $2,847, to the accounting firm of Monchik & Associates PC for a year-end report.\nThe county Democrats reported raising $5,595, spending $13,096 and finishing with a balance of $9,387.\nThis reporting period was only for candidates and committees raising or spending money on statewide offices.\nCampaign trails\nEndorsements -- and political charges -- were flying last week in the state Supreme Court race.\nRepublican Mike Eakin, a Superior Court judge who lives in West Donegal Township, picked up the endorsement of the Pennsylvania State Fraternal Order of Police and the State Troopers Association.\n\"We need strong leadership on the court, and we think Mike has earned his way through the ranks, working as a district attorney (in Cumberland County) and a Superior Court judge -- he's earned the right to the top spot as a Supreme Court justice,\" said Mike Lutz, president of the state FOP.\nEakin's opponent, Democrat Kate Ford Elliott (one of his Superior Court colleagues), was touting the support of Philadelphia's Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 5.\nElliott also was crying foul over Republican State Committee charges that she has been soft on protecting victims of sexual abuse.\nRSC vice chairwoman Eileen Barbera Melvin and the current Cumberland DA, Skip Ebert, alleged Monday that Elliott had voted to overturn prison sentences in three sex predator cases.\nElliott's campaign responded with a statement: \"The Eakin for Supreme Court campaign today became the first in the country to launch a negative political attack predicated upon issues of safety and security in the wake of the terrorist strikes on Sept. 11.\"\nLet the games begin.\nPolitical potpourri\n'County Republicans are hoping that Mark Schweiker, who will be inaugurated as governor Oct. 5, will accept an invitation to speak at the GOP's fall dinner, scheduled Nov. 1 at the Quality Inn, 2363 Oregon Pike.\n'The campaign committee of Republican city Councilman Luis Mendoza, who's running for a second term, will sponsor a free picnic for the community from noon to 4 p.m. Saturday at Lancaster County Central Park's Pavilion 1. Food and entertainment will be provided.\n'City Councilman John Graupera was a special guest at the 19th annual conference of the United States Hispanic Leadership Institute in Chicago. The conference helps to train more than 8,000 Hispanic leaders in 40 states.\nGraupera was among 30 Latino elected officials who were recognized at a luncheon Saturday.\nHelen Colwell Adams is an editor of the Sunday News Perspective section.
