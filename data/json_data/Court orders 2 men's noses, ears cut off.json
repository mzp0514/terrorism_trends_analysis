    "full text": "LAHORE, Pakistan - A Pakistani court has ordered the noses and ears of two men cut off after they did the same thing to a young woman whose family spurned one of the men's marriage proposal, a prosecutor said this week.\nThe anti-terrorism court in the eastern city of Lahore said it was applying Islamic law by ordering the punishment.\nLahore prosecutor Chaudhry Ali Ahmed said one of the accused, Sher Mohammad, was a cousin of the 19-year-old woman and wanted to marry her. Her parents refused his proposal.\nSher Mohammad and a friend, Amanat Mohammad, were accused of kidnapping the woman and cutting off her ears and nose in late September in the Raiwind area of Lahore.\nThe court this week also sentenced each man to 50 years in prison and told them to pay fines and compensation to the woman amounting to several thousand dollars, the prosecutor said.\nPakistan's legal system has Islamic elements that sometimes lead to orders for harsh punishments, but the sentences are often overturned and rarely carried out. Serious crimes are often referred to anti-terrorism courts in Pakistan because they move faster.\nViolence against women, especially attacks by spurned lovers, also occurs frequently in this impoverished South Asian nation.\nThe men have seven days to appeal the ruling, Ahmed said.\n\nLoad-Date: December 28, 2009"
