Evidence indicates they acted on their own, he said.\nA note was found inside the suspects'  U-Haul van at the scene, but authorities were not labeling it  a manifesto, Grewal said. An AR-15-style rifle, a 12-gauge Mossburg shotgun and two other guns were found in the store. Another gun was found in the van.\nInvestigators were working to determine why police officer Joseph Seals and the JC Kosher Supermarket were targeted. Grewal had urged caution against making an anti-Semitic link to Tuesday's bloodshed.\nGrewal said both shooters, who were killed after a long gunbattle with police, \"expressed interest\" in the Black Hebrew Israelite group, which includes factions that have been designated hate groups by watchdog organizations.  Group members, who believe they are descendants of the ancient Israelites, have been known to shout anti-Semitic rhetoric while congregating on the streets of New York City and elsewhere. Grewal said no actual links to the Black Israelites had been established. \n\nLoad-Date: December 13, 2019"
