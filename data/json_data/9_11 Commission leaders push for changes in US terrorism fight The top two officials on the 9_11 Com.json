In a December 2010, an Al Qaeda leader scolded the Pakistani Taliban for indiscriminate attacks against civilians. A letter from bin Laden sent around the same time urges leaders of an east African terrorist group not to announce its merger with Al Qaeda \"because it would be bad for fund-raising and would attract greater attention from the United States.\"\nToday, Al Qaeda and its affiliates maintain a presence in \"some 16 different theaters of operation - compared with half as many as recently as five years ago,\" according to the report.\nIt is true, the report acknowledges, that some of these operating areas are \"less amenable\" than they once were - including, say, Afghanistan and southeast Asia.\nYet there are other places that the report deems \"sites of revival and resuscitation,\" including Iraq and North Africa.\nThere are locations, too, where Al Qaeda has had the chance to expand - such as Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Syria - the report warns.\nThis is in large part because the Middle East \"is experiencing a level of instability unknown in recent years.\"\nIn Syria in particular, the civil war may be providing Al Qaeda \"with a chance to regroup, train, and plan operations, much as the US invasion of Iraq revitalized the network and gave it new relevance,\" notes the report.\nWhile these Al Qaeda groups have been busy expanding in other parts of the globe, within the confines of the United States, the threat of attacks \"has shifted away from plots directly connected to foreign groups,\" in the report's estimation, \"to plots by individuals who are merely inspired by them.\"\n\nLoad-Date: September 12, 2013"
