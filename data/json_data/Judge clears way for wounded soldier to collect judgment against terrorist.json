The act provides a system in which victims may be compensated for losses that result from acts of terrorism.\nSgt. Layne Morris, 45, who lost his right eye in the 2002 gun battle, and the family of Sgt. Christopher Speer won the judgement against the estate of Ahmad Said al-Khadr, whom officials say was a financier to Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida.\nAttorneys for Morris and Speer's widow, Tabitha, had argued that Khadr had trained his young son Omar to kill Americans. The boy, then 15, is accused of killing Speer and wounding Morris, and is being held at Guantanamo Bay.\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury has frozen the elder Khadr's assets but has not released information on the accounts. A spokeswoman for the department said it is up to the victims' attorneys to gather the information on their own.\nAttorneys for the plaintiffs have asked Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, to intervene and Hatch said he is \"very interested\" in the case.\n\nLoad-Date: June 15, 2007"
