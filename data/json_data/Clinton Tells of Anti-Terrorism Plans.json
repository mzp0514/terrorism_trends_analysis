He was for the most part warmly received as he stood on the podium to greet each graduate.\nMany hugged or high-fived him as they received their diplomas.\nA wave of laughter swept the crowd when, in introducing Mr. Clinton, Secretary of the Navy John H. Dalton said: \"There's something you probably don't know about President Clinton.\" It turned out to be that he had been aboard more naval vessels than any other President since Franklin D. Roosevelt.\nMr. Clinton also urged the graduates to enjoy the freedom that they served to protect.\n\"Work hard,\" he said, \"but don't forget to pursue also what fulfills you as people -- the beauty of the natural world, literature, the arts, sports, volunteer service.\"\nMr. Clinton announced the appointment of a National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection and Counterterrorism to coordinate the effort of Federal agencies and enlist the cooperation of the private sector.\nHe named Richard A. Clarke, who is now his special assistant for global affairs.\nMr. Clarke said that the President had asked the Department of Health and Human services to recommend vaccines to be stockpiled. So far, he said, the agency had focused on medicines to counter anthrax and smallpox.\nHe said that \"every day in the United States there are hundreds of attempts to do nonauthorized intrusions\" into computer systems. But it was hard to tell, he said, whether those intrusions were acts of vandalism, industrial espionage or terrorism.\nMr. Clinton said that in setting up new systems to warn of such attacks, \"we must also be careful to uphold privacy rights and other constitutional protections. We do not ever undermine freedom in the name of freedom.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPhoto: President Clinton, the commencement speaker at the United States Naval Academy's graduation ceremonies in Annapolis, Md., watched as a newly commissioned officer held up his diploma.
