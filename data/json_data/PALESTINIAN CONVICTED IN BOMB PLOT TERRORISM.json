    "full text": "NEW YORK (AP) - A Palestinian who testified against the advice of his lawyers and said he wanted to kill as many Jews ''as I could take'' was convicted Thursday of plotting to blow up a busy subway station.\nGazi Ibrahim Abu Mezer, who faces life in prison, jumped to his feet after the verdict was read and shouted ''Allahu Akbar! (God is great)'' as he held up the Koran, the Muslim holy book.\nThe federal jury acquitted a second Palestinian, Lafi Khalil, of plotting the suicide-bombing.\nBefore marshals could muzzle Abu Mezer, 24, he cried out, ''Nobody deserves to die! The Palestinians don't deserve to die!''\nKhalil, 23, who had faced the same possible life sentence if convicted of bomb-related charges, sobbed quietly after the jury found him guilty of one minor count - having a fake immigration card.\nThe case was the third involving terrorist bomb conspiracies in New York City in the past five years. The others, also involving Islamic militants, were the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and a 1994 plot to bomb landmarks, including the United Nations, a federal building, bridges and tunnels.\nAbu Mezer and Khalil were wounded by police bullets in a raid on their shabby Brooklyn apartment last July 31.\n\nLoad-Date: July 25, 1998"
