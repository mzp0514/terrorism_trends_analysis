    "full text": "France timed the announcement for the eve of the long New Year's weekend, it gave \"national interest\" as the reason for its decision, and it promised no further explanation for its decision to send home two jailed Iranians who were wanted for murder in Switzerland.\nBut for all its efforts to keep attention away from the case, the deportation of the two men to Iran last week -- instead of their extradition to Switzerland -- has brought angry protests from French newspapers, opposition parties and Iranian exiles as well as from the Swiss Government.\nMohsen Sharif Esfahani, 37, and Ahmad Taheri, 32, were facing charges of murdering Kazem Rajavi, the brother of the leader of the exiled People's Mujahedeen organization, near Geneva in April 1990. After their arrest here in November 1992, a French court approved their extradition to Switzerland.\nThe Swiss charge d'affaires, Christian Dunant, who delivered a diplomatic note Friday accusing France of violating European extradition accords, said his Government was \"astonished at the behavior of France and regrets it very much.\"\n \n'Incoherence' Charged\n The opposition Socialist Party here accused the rightist Government of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur of \"incoherence and deplorable inconsistency.\" Le Monde said, \"Appearing to cave in to the threat of terrorism is certainly not the best way to fight it.\"\nA former Iranian President, Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, who lives in exile here, said he was \"shocked and indignant\" over the French decision. A spokesman for the People's Mujahedeen said, \"The more concessions the West makes to Teheran, the more terrorist blackmail they will exercise.\"\nResponding to these protests, the French Minister for European Affairs, Alain Lamassoure, insisted on Sunday that Switzerland \"understands\" the reasons for the French decision and that other jailed Iranians would be tried in France. He added that France did not have \"any lessons to learn from anyone\" about fighting terrorism.\nThe French action has nonetheless thrown the spotlight anew on France's readiness to make occasional good-will gestures to the Iranian Government, even at risk of being accused of bending to pressure. The Socialists followed a similar policy before losing power in March.\nIn July 1990, President Francois Mitterrand pardoned Anis Naccache, who led a failed attempt to kill the former Iranian Prime Minister, Shahpur Bakhtiar, in Paris 10 years earlier. Soon after Mr. Naccache was freed, there were signs of an improvement in relations between Paris and Teheran.\n \nTrial in Killing Scheduled\n But in August 1991, Mr. Bakhtiar was knifed to death in his home here. Five months later, two Iranians who were arrested in Switzerland were extradited to France and charged with \"complicity with murder.\" Their trial is scheduled to occur this year.\nThe decision to send Mr. Esfahani and Mr. Taheri home last week, on the other hand, may have been linked to France's agreement to grant exile last month to Maryam Rajavi, whose husband, Massoud, heads the People's Mujahedeen. The next day, grenades were thrown at an Air France office and into the garden of the French Embassy in Teheran.\nFrench officials, who insisted on anonymity, said the decision to receive Mrs. Rajavi brought a wave of threats from pro-Teheran fundamentalist groups, and they acknowledged that the freeing of Mr. Esfahani and Mr. Taheri could be read as a gesture of conciliation toward Iran.\nIn 1986 Paris was rocked by a series of bombings and other terrorist actions attributed to pro-Teheran groups.\nFrancois Rudetzki, who was wounded in one such bombing and now heads an association of victims, was among those protesting France's decision last week. \"Terrorism is international,\" she said, \"yet we're now refusing to cooperate with Swiss justice.\"\n\nLoad-Date: January 4, 1994"
