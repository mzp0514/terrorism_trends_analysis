In Managua, the Nicaraguan capital, a mass celebrated by the Pope was interrupted by heckling organized by the ruling Sandinists.\nThe radio commentary criticized that it called ''two unheard-of affronts.'' It described the heckling during mass as a ''profanation'' and accused the Sandinists of a ''vulgar, indecent'' act.\nThe Vatican radio commentator was even harsher in denouncing the Guatemalan Government, saying, ''The other act, more subtle and contemptuous on the part of the Guatemalan authorities, which a few days before the arrival of the Pontiff in their nation executed by firing squad six persons condemned by a phantom special court.''\n''Contempt of any form of good manners and clumsy propaganda manipulation on one hand; on the other arrogance, even 'drunkenness of power,' as a newspaper called it, on the part of those who pretend to kill in the name of God,'' the Vatican radio continued in denouncing Nicaragua and Guatemala, respectively."
