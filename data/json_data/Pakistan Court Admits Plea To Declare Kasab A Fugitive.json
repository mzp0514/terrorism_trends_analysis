Several witnesses were scheduled to testify during Monday&apos;s hearing but could not do so as the court took up the FIA&apos;s application.\nThe FIA&apos;s plea had become necessary as a bench of the Lahore High Court last Tuesday ruled that Kasab&apos;s trial could not be separated from that of the seven accused, including Lashker-e-Taiba (LeT) operations commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, booked under the Anti- Terrorism Act, Pakistan Penal Code and a cyber crimes law.\nThe Rawalpindi-based bench of the Lahore High Court had also ruled that Kasab&apos;s confessional statement to Indian authorities could not be used in Pakistani courts.\nDefense lawyers for the accused were planning to challenge the FIA&apos;s move to get Kasab declared a fugitive as he was \"not willingly avoiding an appearance in a Pakistani court,\" but0 was in the custody of Indian authorities and is thus not a fugitive from law.\nThe seven jihadists have been accused of training and providing financial support, accommodation, equipment and communications gear to the 10 terrorists who attacked Mumbai in November 2008 and killed nearly 180 people, including many Americans.\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\nCopyright(c) 2010 RTTNews.com, Inc.
