    "full text": "With the car attack in Berlin fresh in mind and Australia's announcement that it had thwarted a Christmas terrorist plot, it makes sense to ask:How should Americans respond to terror? We live in an age of it, and it seems unlikely that it will abate any time soon.\nIn truth, terror - a surprise attack on, and execution of, innocents in order to destabilize a great power - has been with us as a political force since the beginning of recorded history.\nHow should America cope?\nOnly a fool would presume to know the full answer.But it is possible to say what the nation should not do:\n* The U.S. government should not engage in impulsive or knee-jerk reaction.\nThat is, America should not do as the Ohio Legislature did earlier this month by passing a law that essentially endorses the idea of arming college kids. The law -following the Nov. 28 attack on the Ohio State University campus by Abdul Razak Ali Artan, who rammed his car into a group of bystanders and then got out and began swinging a knife at passers-by -gives public colleges and universities the option of allowing people to carry concealed guns on campus.\nLeaders in Washington should not rush to war, as they did after 9/11 - seeking to punish someone because they could.Nor should they abridge civil liberties on the premise that an enhanced national security state will deter all threats.\n* But neither should the United States act like a helpless giant.\nAmerica has the CIA, the Navy SEALs and other military and intelligence elites. We can track bad guys who hurt our families and countrymen and catch them and punish them. We need to be patient and stay with it, as Barack Obama and his team did in pursuing Osama bin Laden.\nPatience pays.\n* The nation should not become desensitized.\nAssassination and terrorist deaths cannot become the new normal. Americans never should cease to be outraged or to cry out for justice.\n* But the United States cannot be rattled.\nAmericans must be stoic and carry on. We must live our lives, travel and continue to engage with the world and, as a nation, take our stand, based on our founding principles and national interests.\nBut, chiefly, we cannot let terror terrorize us. As Franklin Delano Roosevelt said, the true enemy is fear itself. Therefore, we face it.\n\nLoad-Date: December 27, 2016"
