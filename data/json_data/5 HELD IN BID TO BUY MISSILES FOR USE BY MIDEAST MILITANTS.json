    "full text": "PHILADELPHIA -- The FBI terrorism task force in Philadelphia has arrested five men of Lebanese origin, following an extensive international undercover sting in which one of the men allegedly tried to purchase 100 Stinger missiles designed to shoot down aircraft.\nThe central figure in the case planned to use the anti-aircraft weapons and 250 machine guns in the Middle East, and asked to have them exported to Iran or Syria for use by \"the Resistance,\" a reference to the Palestinians fighting Israelis, according to an FBI affidavit unsealed yesterday.\nThe case began in June 2007 as a stolen goods case, in which an undercover agent in Philadelphia began selling purportedly stolen goods -- laptop computers, cell phones and video games -- to one of the conspirators in Slovakia. But the FBI says the investigation soon evolved into a case involving weapons systems.\nIn March of this year, Dani Nemr Tarraf asked an undercover FBI agent in Philadelphia if he \"could acquire missiles or rockets that were capable of shooting down airplanes or helicopters,\" according to the FBI affidavit.\nThe affidavit, by FBI Supervisory Agent Samuel Smemo Jr. of the Joint Terrorism Task Force, said the undercover agent met with Tarraf in Slovakia in May to discuss their business, and this conversation occurred:\nUndercover agent: \"You got to know that all my stuff comes -- I'm not a regular businessman.\"\nTarraf: \"Absolutely.\"\nAgent: \"All my stuff, ... it's stolen.\"\nTarraf: \"Yes, yes, I know.\"\nDuring a meeting in Philadelphia in June, Mr. Tarraf allegedly asked for missiles that could \"take down an F-16,\" the FBI said. He also allegedly asked for 250 Colt M4 Carbine machine guns.\nMr. Tarraf allegedly made a $20,000 down payment for the missiles and machine guns in late July, instructing the undercover FBI agent to ship them to the port of Latakia in Syria.\nIn August, the FBI says, the undercover agent sold Mr. Tarraf about 1,000 military-grade compasses, shipping them to Beruit, with instructions from Mr. Tarraf to falsely mark them as \"spare parts\" on export documents.\nMr. Tarraf allegedly traveled Saturday to Philadelphia and was arrested by the local terrorism task force. The documents unsealed yesterday do not describe the circumstances of his arrest. Federal officials in Philadelphia declined to comment.\nMr. Tarraf is being held without bond at the Federal Detention Center in Philadelphia. He is charged with conspiracy to acquire a missile system designed to destroy aircraft, transport of stolen property, conspiracy to possess machine guns and conspiracy to commit passport fraud.\nThree others were charged with conspiracy to transport stolen property. Details about the men were not immediately available. A fifth man, Ali Fadel Yahfoufi, a citizen of Lebanon, was charged with Mr. Tarraf with conspiracy to commit passport fraud.\n\nLoad-Date: November 24, 2009"
