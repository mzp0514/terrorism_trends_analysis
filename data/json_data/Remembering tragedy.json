    "full text": "The groundbreaking for the Oklahoma City National Memorial took place Sunday. The memorial will pay homage to those who died in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building on April 19, 1995.\nU. Oklahoma\nThis tragedy left a scar on the collective psyche of Oklahomans. We were left wondering how such a horrible event could disrupt our quiet lives here in the Heartland.\nAt first, many of us couldn't believe it had really happened. It served as a terrible awakening for us and the rest of the world. Terrorism was no longer something that only struck distant countries or big cities; it could strike our neighbors and friends at home as well.\nIt is only right that we honor the 168 people who lost their lives in the bombing. While the victims' families will never completely heal from their loss, we hope this memorial will give them a place to remember their loved ones.\nThis memorial will also serve to remind us we must be vigilant in protecting our soil from terrorism, both international and domestic. The recent budget accord included a nearly $ 3 billion increase in funding for the fight against terrorism. The fight must continue, and this move was a wonderful step in the right direction.\nThe tragedy of the bombing is behind us, but we must not let it be forgotten.\n(C) 1999 Oklahoma Daily via U-WIRE\n\nLoad-Date: February 8, 1999"
