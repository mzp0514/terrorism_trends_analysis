The greater threat is to softer targets in the greater Sochi area, in the outskirts beyond Sochi, where there is a substantial potential for a terrorist attack.\"\n\"We are very focused on the Sochi Olympics and we have seen an uptick in threat reporting regarding Sochi, and this is what we expected given where the Olympics are located,\" added Olsen, who traveled to Russia last year to consult with officials about the Games. \"There are a number of extremists in that area.\"\nThe specter of terrorism has long shrouded the Sochi Winter Games because of the host city's proximity to a hotbed of Islamic extremist activity in the North Caucasus region. And the terrorism fears have intensified in the past month after suicide bombing attacks in the city of Volgograd left more than 30 people dead, nearly 500 miles from Sochi.\nChechen separatist leader Doku Umarov has called on followers to disrupt the Olympic Games.\nLate last week, the U.S. Olympic Committee sent a memo to the contingent of 230 American athletes advising them not to display identifying clothing or colors outside of secure, accredited areas.\nU.S. authorities had expressed frustration after learning only through media reports of the Russian government's recent dragnet in the Sochi area for possible terrorism suspects, including a suspected female suicide bomber.\nFBI Director James Comey, who testified at Wednesday's hearing, said cooperation between the FBI and the Russian FSB on security issues surrounding the Olympics, which run Feb. 7-23, has been \"steadily improving\" as the Games approach.\n\"We have a good level of cooperation there,\" Comey said. \"It can always improve. We are looking for ways to improve it, as are they.\"\nMeanwhile, in Russia, the Games' organizing committee chief, Dmitry Chernyshenko, said Wednesday that Sochi is \"fully ready\" and will deliver safe, friendly and well-run Games that defy the grim reports that have overshadowed preparations, the Associated Press reported.\nChernyshenko said the city is the \"most secure venue at the moment on the planet\" and promised that tight security measures will not detract from the atmosphere of the Games.\nNevertheless, U.S. lawmakers have expressed grave concerns about the Sochi Olympics, even as the Russians announced plans to deploy more than 50,000 police officers and soldiers to beef up security.\nOn CBS' Face the Nation on Sunday, Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas and chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, called the security threat \"the greatest I think I've ever seen because of the proximity of the terrorists to the Olympic village.\" \n\nGraphic\n\n \nphoto David Goldman, AP\n\nLoad-Date: January 30, 2014"
