At the same time, they're sending signals that the war against the Taliban and Osama bin Laden will be broadened and will include countries and organizations. So the writing is on the wall, and Arafat decided this time he's not going to make the same mistake he made in 1991. He'd better jump on the American bandwagon.\"\nHis enlistment in the anti-terrorism war does not come without peril or repercussions - for him or the Middle East. After his police used deadly force Monday to put down an anti-American demonstration by Palestinians in Gaza, Arafat found himself looking for ways to prevent a civil war within his own ranks.\nMeanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who has had his own discomfort with the American-led war on terrorism, watches suspiciously to see whether Arafat's moves offer hope or just portend more bloodshed.\n\"The truth of the matter is, one being a very powerful and effective general, one being a guerrilla leader, and both of them being quite old and of different schools, both benefit from a low level of violence,\" said Judith Kipper, a Middle East expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"Unfortunately, when you have violence you can't always keep it at a low level.\"\nArafat's order to have his police use tear gas, clubs and finally guns on the demonstrators who supported bin Laden put him squarely in the international coalition's camp. But it is a treacherous path that has taken him there.\nHis Palestinian Authority has little to show for the uprising against Israel - the intifada - that it has encouraged in the past year. It will take all the survival skills that the terrorist-turned-diplomat has shown over several decades to keep control of his own movement, while appearing not to side with terrorists, now the bane of the international community.\nHe has even taken to barring foreign journalists from Gaza to block images of Palestinians showing solidarity with bin Laden.\nMonday's shooting began after some in the crowd of 2,000 demonstrators at the Islamic University in Gaza City threw stones and police tried to break up the melee. Two people were killed, including a 13-year-old boy, and others were injured.\nSince then, Arafat's police have arrested about 50 Palestinian activists and have temporarily closed some schools in Gaza.\nAt an Islamic conference in Qatar on Wednesday, where Arafat declared his unity with the anti-terror campaign, he accused Israel of exploiting the Sept. 11 attacks to wage more assaults on Palestinians. Sharon spokesman Raanan Gissin countered that Israel was just defending itself, \"exactly what the U.S. is doing after it was attacked.\"\nWhat triggered the violence in Gaza was the videotaped broadside against the United States by bin Laden. In the tape, bin Laden embraced the Palestinian cause. It was shown worldwide Sunday just as the American-led assault began on Afghanistan.\n\"People like Osama bin Laden align themselves with these legitimate issues,\" said Hisham Melhem, Washington bureau chief for As-Safir, a Beirut, Lebanon, newspaper. \"That's what Iraq did in 1991. These issues resonate well with the average Arab and average Muslim, whether he or she is sitting in Cairo or Karachi. When you talk about occupied Jerusalem, people listen. That has resonance. It doesn't mean people support [bin Laden]. It means people are angry and resentful of U.S. policies.\"\nArafat's spokesman told Palestinian radio this week that bin Laden should not use the Palestinian cause to justify terrorism.\nUnder constant danger from suicide bombers and other acts of terror, Israel and the United States have pressed Arafat to crack down on militants and end the terrorist violence. As peace talks have foundered, and his stature in Washington has suffered, Arafat's attempt to rein in some of the militants and take sides against bin Laden could win him some new credibility.\nBut by turning guns on his own people, Arafat has widened the gulf with Hamas, a sponsor of suicide attacks on Israel and a faction whose popularity among Palestinians is growing.\nShould he continue to crack down on the militants, as Israel and Washington want, he probably will inflame them further. He could face more angry demonstrators and more deadly decisions about how to control them. His own ability to be seen as someone who can deliver anything at the peace table could be at risk.\nYossi Shain, an expert on Israeli politics and former head of the government department at Tel Aviv University, said the Palestinian leader was reaping his own political whirlwind.\n\"Arafat unleashed the voices of rejection, the voice of the Islamists,\" said Shain, a visiting professor at Georgetown University. \"Now he does not know how to put the genie back in the bottle.\"\nThe forces set in motion on Sept. 11 have significantly altered the political landscape in the region. Arafat, said Richard Murphy, a former U.S. ambassador to Syria and Saudi Arabia, \"has had to hold an umbrella over an entire organization. That's something you can't really get away with anymore. He's got to choose.\"\nAs the violence in Gaza on Monday showed, Murphy said, \"it's not an easy choice.\"\nMeanwhile, Sharon finds himself in an uneasy spot, after complaining last week that the U.S. effort to build a coalition to fight terrorism was an attempt to \"appease the Arabs at our expense.\"\nHe likened the situation to 1938 when Hitler wanted Czechoslovakia and the West did little. \"Israel will not be Czechoslovakia.\"\nSuch remarks, the White House said, were unacceptable. American officials have also tried to push Sharon into easing his demands about conditions for talks with Arafat.\nSharon might have thought that the horror of Sept. 11 would help bolster support for Israel's own war against terrorism, which has included assassinations, among other operations. But when the United States did not include Hamas, Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad, three terrorists groups responsible for most of the hostilities inside Israel, as primary targets in the war on terrorism, he felt abandoned.\n\"He clearly misread how the United States has to deal with this,\" said William Quandt, Middle East diplomacy expert who served on the National Security Council under President Jimmy Carter.\n\"We're not in a position like Israel to just clobber people who are tormenting us. We need huge groups of friends and allies to make this work. Sharon clearly misread the global dimensions for us. As a result, he clearly annoyed the Bush administration as they were trying to engage in fairly complicated coalition building.\"\nStill, Sharon is in a much stronger position than Arafat. He heads an uneasy but workable coalition government. It is a constant balance of the right and left political wings. But his country - unlike the Palestinians - is largely unified.\nMoreover, Israel has an ally in the United States that has suddenly declared that terrorism, a constant threat to Israel, is the No. 1 concern of the world and even has gone to war over it, said Daniel Pipes, director of the Middle East Forum, a Philadelphia think tank.\nSharon, since his upbraiding by Washington, might be grumbling in private, but he has declared his support for the international anti-terrorism war. It will take a clearer view of the outcome of that war, Pipes said, before any serious movement on peace occurs in the Middle East.\n\"It's on hold,\" he said. \"All eyes are on Afghanistan.\"\n\nLoad-Date: October 12, 2001"
