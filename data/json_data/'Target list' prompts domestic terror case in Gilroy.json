He also complained about overcrowding towns and paving open space to make room for \"hordes\" of Latinos and Silicon Valley whites.\nFamily members of Legan released a statement saying they were \"deeply shocked and horrified\" by his actions. They also apologized to the victims and their families.\n\"We have never and would never condone the hateful thoughts and ideologies that led to this event, and it is impossible to reconcile this with the son we thought we knew,\" the statement said.\nLegan grew up less than a mile from Christmas Hill Park, where the festival was held. His father was a competitive runner and coach, and his grandfather was a Santa Clara County supervisor.\nThe statement, distributed by attorney Chuck Smith, said the family has cooperated with the investigation.\n\"We are heartbroken that he committed this violence in his hometown, at a family event meant to celebrate the tight-knit community we have been a part of for 20 years,\" the statement said. \"To the city of Gilroy and to everyone affected, we are tremendously sorry. No words can begin to express this.\"\nThe target list, which also included federal buildings and both major U.S. political parties, was found during the examination of the digital evidence. Bennett said the groups included were being notified but the FBI would not release their names.\nBennett said there was no indication that Legan did anything violent prior to attacking people at the Gilroy Garlic Festival with an AK-47-style\nrifle before turning the gun on himself. Thirteen people were injured.\nA separate mass shooting that killed 22 people at a crowded El Paso, Texas, store over the weekend was also being handled as a domestic terrorism case.\nThe FBI has not said it was treating the mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio, as an act of domestic terrorism. A gunman there killed nine people in a nightclub district.\nThe FBI's disclosure Tuesday came as the family of Gilroy victim Keyla Salazar held a funeral mass for the 13-year-old girl.\nBennett told victims' families that nothing he could say or do would bring back their loved ones.\nStill, he said, \"Everything is being done with you in our minds.\"\n\nLoad-Date: August 8, 2019"
