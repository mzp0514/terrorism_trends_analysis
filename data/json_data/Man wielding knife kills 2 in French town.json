    "full text": "PARIS -- A man wielding a knife attacked residents of a French town while they ventured out to shop amid a nationwide coronavirus lockdown Saturday, killing two people and wounding five in an act that led authorities to open a terrorism inquiry. \nFrance's counterterrorism prosecutor's office said the assailant was arrested near the scene of the attack in the town of Romans-sur-Isere, south of Lyon, as he was kneeling on the sidewalk praying in Arabic. It said one of his acquaintances also was detained. \nProsecutors did not identify the suspect. They said he had no identifying documents but claimed to be Sudanese and to have been born in 1987. \nDuring a subsequent search of his home, authorities found handwritten documents that included arguments about religion and a complaint about living in a \"country of unbelievers,\" officials said. \nThe prosecutor's office did not confirm reports that the man shouted \"Allahu akbar\" (God is great) as he stabbed and slashed people. \nLike the entire population of France, Romans-sur-Isere's residents have been ordered to stay home except for a few exceptions. The victims were doing their food shopping, one of the permitted outside activities, on the street that has bakeries and grocery stores, the prosecutor's office said. \nIt is unclear whether the suspect in Saturday's attack had psychological problems or any links to extremism. Analysts say some extremist groups see the upheaval from the virus pandemic as an opportunity to win over more supporters. \n\nLoad-Date: April 6, 2020"
