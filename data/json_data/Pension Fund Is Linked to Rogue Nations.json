The senator said New York was \"behind the curve\" on the issue, noting that California, Florida, and New Jersey have already divested from companies that deal with the terrorist states.\nThe fund, which handles pensions for all state employees and is the second largest pension fund in the country, has investments in 235 such companies.\nA spokesman for Mr. DiNapoli said the comptroller was \"aware of these issues,\" and is reviewing them. Mr. DiNapoli announced last week that he would use the state pension fund to pressure the Sudanese government to end the genocide in Darfur, taking steps that will eventually include divestment if companies refuse to pull out of Sudan.\nMr. Klein, who said he expected the bill to garner bipartisan support, noted that pressure from state pension funds could force corporations to stop doing business with states that promote terrorism.\nA threat from the pension fund would force the corporations to make a choice, he said. \"Do you want to continue to have our investments, or do you want to sponsor these countries that sponsor terrorism?\"\n\nLoad-Date: June 18, 2007"
