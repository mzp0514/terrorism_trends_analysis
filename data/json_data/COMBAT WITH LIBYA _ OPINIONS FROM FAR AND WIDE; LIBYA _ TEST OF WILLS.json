    "full text": "The military clash between Libya and the United States during the last two days represents a confluence of varied elements. On the surface, it is the American assertion of its right of passage through international waters in conflict with Libya's territorial claims.\nBut on a deeper level, it has been a strike against what Washington says is Libya's support of terrorism, and against the image of a United States helpless to deal with a provocative figure such as the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.  The Administration's action appears to have been carefully calibrated and timed to minimize political risk, both in Soviet-American relations and in the Middle East.\nThe Soviet Union was notified of the coming naval exercise in the Gulf of Sidra, and Soviet officials were reportedly left with no illusions about the likelihood of an American strike at the SAM-5 missile batteries, where Soviet technicians had been working.\nPerhaps coincidentally, the commander of the Soviet Mediterranean fleet reportedly moved earlier this month from a submarine tender that had pointedly sailed into Tripoli at the height of American-Libyan tensions last January. The ship is still there, according to the Pentagon, but the admiral is on another vessel.\n \nMideast Peace Effort Dormant\nIn the Middle East, the delicate Jordanian-Israeli peace effort is now dormant, so the Administration sees little risk of damaging what barely exists.\nThe move toward confrontation with Libya began last December, after a Palestinian group, which was said to have received support from Libya, conducted terrorist attacks at the Rome and Vienna airports. The threat of Libyan-organized attacks on United States diplomats was cited today by White House aides as one of reasons for the recent maneuvers near Libya.\nIn January, Administration officials envisioned almost exactly the scenario that has taken place in the last two days. President Reagan's advisers calculated that when Navy ships and aircraft moved into the Gulf of Sidra, Libya would fire missiles and the United States would destroy them, possibly killing Soviet technicians at the missile batteries.\n \nThreat to Commercial Aircraft\nThe Soviet-built missiles, with a 180-mile range, were seen by the United States as potentially threatening to commercial aircraft. Officials in Washington have considered it unlikely that Libya would attack a passenger plane, but not entirely out of the question, especially since Israeli planes last month forced a Libyan jet to land at an Israeli air base. Colonel Qaddafi threatened to retaliate against El Al, the Israeli airline.\nNo Soviet casualties have been reported at the missile site, and that has reduced the potential for damage to Soviet-American relations. But in other respects the clash went according to expectations. Libya and the United States, both motivated more strongly by political than military considerations, seemed to play willingly into each other's hands. They allowed each other to maintain the impression of valor, to avoid the risk of having threats shown to be empty and to enjoy the convenience of having a clearly focused enemy.\nBut the American military gain in the last two days seems inconclusive. The missile battery at Sidra is only one of two or three being installed; the question remains what the United States will do about the others. The patrol boats that were sunk play little role in the regional military balance, which is of great concern to pro-Western Arab governments, such as that of Egypt, that have poor relations with Libya.\nThe Administration has calculated that after Mr. Reagan's strong denunciations of Libya for supporting terrorism, failure to act would be taken as evidence of a lack of American resolve, a reluctance to use American power.\n \nPast Actions Cited\nFurthermore, as one State Department specialist on terrorism noted, Colonel Qaddafi has a history of backing off in the face of direct military confrontation. This official said there was no evidence of specific Libyan plans to attack Americans or American facilities - in contrast to assertions to that effect by high-ranking aides to Mr. Reagan. But he also remarked that there had been no indication that what he called Libya's general support for terrorist groups had been curbed.\nSome specialists questioned how much effect the American attacks of the last two days would have on Colonel Qaddafi. ''The problem of Libya has been subversion, terrorism, and that's exactly what you don't touch with this,'' said William B. Quandt, formerly an adviser to President Carter on the Middle East who is now at the Brookings Institution. A more effective military action would have been an air strike on terrorist training camps in Libya, he said, adding that, from the perspective of other Arab leaders, ''We would get more secret applause if we mounted a major operation to knock out his armored forces. What we don't like about Libya is its military threat to its neighbors.''\nSome Pentagon and State Department analysts believe that the clashes may provoke Libyan retaliation, as has been threatened by Libya's official radio, which declared: ''The oil which America exploits and usurps should now be destroyed. The American bases in the Arab homeland should now be stormed. American spies who were pushed forward as experts and consultants should now be executed, wherever they might be in the Arab homeland.''\nBut a private specialist on terrorism doubted that Colonel Qaddafi would take such a step. ''He may be crazy, but he's not stupid,'' the expert said. ''If you don't pay attention to his words and you watch his hands, you see a much more cautious use of terrorism.''\nOne worry has been the extent to which pro-Western Arab governments would feel obliged to criticize the United States on the basis of their regard for Arab unity and public opinion in their countries. An early sign of encouragement for the Administration came in Tunis, where the Arab League rejected Libya's request that it interrupt its agenda and deal immediately with the clash.\nThe league continued discussing the Iran-Iraq war, hearing detailed complaints from Iraq that Libya was supplying arms to Iran."
