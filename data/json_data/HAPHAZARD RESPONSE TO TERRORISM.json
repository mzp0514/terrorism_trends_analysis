    "full text": "Just about everything that could go wrong regarding Pan Am Flight 103 has gonewrong. First was the terrorist bombing itself on Dec. 21, 1988, over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 innocent civilian passengers and people on the ground. Some of the governments involved in the bombing investigation botched their mission. They have failed so far to capture some of the terrorists involved in the operation, although many of the facts and shadowy participants are known to investigators.  And before the mid-air explosion, Pan Am and the airports through which the flight passed at Frankfurt, West Germany, and London failed to screen passengers and baggage responsibly. In the eyes of Iranian leaders believed to have ordered the bombing, their decision was fair retaliation for the downing by a U.S. warship of an Iranian civilian airliner over the Persian Gulf five months earlier.  The haphazard work continues with the recent report of a presidential commission ordered to investigate the Pan Am bombing. Leading the list of faulty suggestions is the one calling for direct military retaliation against a country that orders a terrorist bombing.  This impulse may be the first for any U.S. leader faced with explaining what is being done about a terrorist attack on civilians. But it should quickly be overtaken by the realization that such retaliation would only escalate the protracted conflict between the United States and several countries known to host terrorists - Iran, Syria and Libya, to mention three on anyone's short list.\nWhat, too, should be done if a preliminary investigation shows that the terrorists operated a safe house on the soil of a major ally such as West Germany or France?  The commission also recommended covert actions against suspected terrorists. Here, the problem is twofold. The United States should not be involved in killing suspected terrorists; it should work to uphold and strengthen international laws and conventions against terrorism. It should encourage international cooperation by national police agencies. Again, the chance of escalating retaliation can never be dismissed. Terrorists strike when and where they want; to give them even more rationalizations would be folly.  The panel also would end installation of expensive Thermal Neutron Analysis machines at certain airports worldwide; this device may work along with many other methods to reduce terrorism. The real response to international terrorism, however, must be multifaceted and complex. Governments must work together and keep both mistakes and provocations for future attacks to a minimum.\n\nLoad-Date: October 14, 1993"
