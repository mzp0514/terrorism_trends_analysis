But analysts said some of the market's slide was because of normal profit-taking. \n The Dow Jones industrials plunged more than 160 points before regaining ground late in the session, despite a better-than-expected report on business inventories and news that several companies were in merger talks.\n \"This market is vulnerable to good news, bad news or no news, so certainly the news of terrorist activity over the weekend and new threats from Al Qaeda will provoke a reaction,\" said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards & Sons. \"But I do not see a serious downside from here; there's too much good going on.\"\n The Dow ended the day down 57.85 points, or 0.6 percent, at 9,710.83, after a decline last week of 0.4 percent.\n The broader market indexes also fell. The Nasdaq composite index closed down 20.65 points, or 1.1 percent, at 1,909.61, after a weekly drop of 2.1 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 6.72 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 1,043.63, after falling 0.3 percent last week.\n In Tokyo, government leaders shrugged off the latest terrorist threats, but the Nikkei 225-stock average lurched to a three-month low after the reports about Al Qaeda, closing down 3.7 percent.\n European markets followed. The CAC-40 of France lost 2.6 percent, the FTSE 100 of Britain fell 1.3 percent and the DAX index of Germany was down 3.2 percent.\n A Commerce Department report showed America's businesses increased their stockpiles of unsold goods in September for the first time in six months, a sign that companies may be feeling more confident about the recovery. Economists were expecting inventories to be flat in September.\n Financial services companies were under pressure related to the investigation of mutual fund trading practices. Morgan Stanley, which saw earlier declines, gained 9 cents to close at $55.03 after federal regulators said it had agreed to change some trading practices and pay a $50 million penalty to settle charges.\n Several companies were in merger talks but that did little to raise the major indexes.\n Travelers Property Casualty announced that it would combine with the St. Paul Companies in a $16 billion stock deal. St. Paul was up 97 cents at $37.74 on the news. Travelers' Class A shares were unchanged at $16.03; Class B shares fell 2 cents to $16.04.\n Also, the auto parts maker ArvinMeritor said it would increase its hostile takeover bid for Dana. ArvinMeritor lost 12 cents, falling to $17.94; Dana dropped $1.41, or 8.5 percent, to close at $15.24.\n And Sun Microsystems announced that it was planning a partnership with Advanced Micro Devices, an alliance that could help the two smaller companies better compete against larger producers like Intel. Sun lost 2 cents to close at $4.08. AMD fell 50 cents to $17.36, and Intel shed 57 cents to close at $32.23.\n|||\n|--------------------||\n\nTreasury Prices Climb\nBy Reuters\n Treasury prices rose yesterday as investors fled sliding stocks and sought safety in bonds, pushing benchmark yields down to six-week lows. A round of profit-taking pulled the market back from its best levels, however. Analysts said investors were reluctant to push yields (which move in the opposite direction of bond prices) lower as long as evidence points to a recovery. \n \"It's a pretty straightforward case of weak equities helping bonds, but there's still the feeling that we're running up against some kind of a brick wall and that's why prices were unable to push a whole lot higher,\" said Anthony Karydakis, senior financial economist at Banc One Capital Markets.\n By late in the day, the benchmark 10-year note gained 7/32, to 100 15/32; its yield fell to 4.19 percent from 4.22 percent on Friday.\n Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills: \n\n(000 omitted in dollar figures)\n|3-Mo. Bills|6-Mo. Bills|\nPrice|99.764|99.489|\nHigh Rate|0.935|1.010|\nInvestment Rate|0.951|1.033|\nLow Rate|0.900|0.980|\nMedian Rate|0.925|1.005|\nTotal applied for|$45,062,348|$45,211,292|\nAccepted|$22,053,273|$21,893,360|\nNoncompetitive|$1,331,480|$1,023,576|\n\nBoth issues are dated Nov. 20.
