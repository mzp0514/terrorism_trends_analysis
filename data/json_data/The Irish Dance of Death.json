    "full text": "The avowed aim of the Irish Republican Army is to end what it regards as a British military occupation of Northern Ireland. But its deeds make any reduction in security forces unthinkable.\nEditorial comment discusses eye-for-eye bloodletting that continues between Northern Ireland and Irish RepublicA year ago, its guerrillas murdered Lord Mountbatten. Now they have claimed two more prominent victims, Sir Norman Stronge and his son, James, both leading Protestants in Ulster.\nThe I.R.A.'s terrorism in no way exculpates comparable outrages by Protestant killer-squads. A week ago, the Ulster Defense Association took responsibility for trying to murder the fiery Catholic leader, Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, and her husband Michael. The couple barely survived their wounds. Last fall, the same Protestant paramilitary group killed four nationalists who had been leaders in a sympathy campaign for imprisoned I.R.A. hunger-strikers.\nSo long as this eye-for-an-eye bloodletting continues, no British government could possibly withdraw its troops from the British-ruled North. Endless reprisals thus serve the ends of zealots among the Protestant majority, who fear any loss of British protection. With each vendetta, hopes recede for any settlement that might produce a new kind of unity between Northern\nIreland and the Irish Republic.  Ireland's Prime Minister Haughey believes that a new design is possible. His ideas are being seriously weighed by Britain's Prime Minister Thatcher. These are the stirrings that most alarm the Protestant extremists. How tragic that Irish extremists strengthen the case against any changes that might lead to peace. In the anquished words of Mr. Haughey, ''When will the killing stop?''"
