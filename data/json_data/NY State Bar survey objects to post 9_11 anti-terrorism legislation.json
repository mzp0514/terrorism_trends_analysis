    "full text": "A majority of respondents to an online survey conducted by the New York State Bar Association said the anti-terrorism legislation enacted post 9/11 is being applied inappropriately.\nThe survey, which was posted on the NYSBA website from Jan. 12 to 16, asked if the legislation and its application have been appropriate given the circumstances or inappropriate.\nResults indicated: 63 percent said it has been inappropriate; 32 percent said it has been appropriate; 5 percent were undecided.\nRespondents also showed strong support ( 69 percent) for televising the trial of Saddam Hussein and affording American citizens arrested for terrorism Constitutional rights. Only one percent was undecided about televising the trial while 30 percent objected.\nIn addition, 85 percent said American citizens arrested for terrorism should be afforded constitutional rights and only 13 percent said they should be held as prisoners of war. Two percent responded that they were undecided. This issue has arisen in the cases of American citizens who are being held by the U.S. government as enemy combatants - without the rights that criminal defendants normally have to consult with counsel, to be charged promptly and to have a speedy trial - and is likely to be resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nLoad-Date: February 26, 2004"
