    "full text": "SAN'A, Yemen -- The United States itself bears some responsibility for the attack on the USS Cole because it helped create the terrorists who now consider America their worst enemy, Yemen's foreign minister said Monday.\nForeign Minister Abdulkader Bajammal also said Yemen wants to work closely with the United States to combat terrorism.\n\"The operation was not Yemeni, not pure Yemeni,\" Bajammal said. \"It is a network involving so many countries. Terrorism has no nation.\"\nNo one has yet been charged in the Oct. 12 bombing of the USS Cole, which killed 17 sailors and wounded 39. Asked if any indictments were forthcoming, Bajammal said he had no information.\nBut Bajammal said that if any Yemenis are found to have been involved, they simply may have been corrupt bureaucrats who provided logistical help in exchange for \"a little baksheesh,\" or payoffs not out of ideology.\n\"We are a victim of terrorism, not a source of terrorism,\" Bajammal added.\nThe attack on the Cole followed anti-U.S. and anti-Israeli protests in Yemen and across an Arab world enraged by violence in Palestinian areas. Nearly 300 people mostly Palestinians have been killed in Israeli-Palestinian clashes since September.\nThe roots of anti-American terrorism run back to the 1980s when one of the last-gasp Cold War battles was waged in Afghanistan. Bajammal said that because the investigation was continuing, he could not comment on the possibility that Yemeni or other American-financed Arab veterans of the Afghan war were involved in the Cole attack.\n\nLoad-Date: December 5, 2000"
