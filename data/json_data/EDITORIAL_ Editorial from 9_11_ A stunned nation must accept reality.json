    "full text": "Sept. 11--The United States is at war. And Americans watched it all unfold on live television.\nIt was unbelievable. Or, at least, we didn't want to believe it.\nYet, it is real. The image of the hijacked airliners crashing into the already burning World Trade Center is forever etched in the minds of all Americans.\nAlthough we have all seen terrorist attacks enacted in amazing detail in the movies and TV shows, none of us were really prepared for this morning.\nThe World Trade Center was struck by the first airplane just before 6 a.m. PDT.\nEighteen minutes later the second plane struck the 110-story twin towers in New York where 50,000 people work. To put it in perspective, that's about as many people as live in Walla Walla County.\nAbout an hour after the New York attack, the Pentagon was in flames after being struck by an aircraft. And then another hijacked airliner, believed to be a 747 Jumbo Jet, crashed outside of Pittsburgh.\nBefore today, most of us clung to the belief that this type of extensive, calculated terrorist attack could not happen in the United States.\nWe thought that the Oklahoma City bombing, which was an act of domestic terrorism, was as bad as it could get.\nToday -- our minds numb with tears welling in our eyes -- we are starting to see just how horrific it can be.\nThe death toll from this day, which is not over yet, will be staggering. It is likely that thousands of American have lost their lives.\nThe United States is at war, but we don't know who has attacked us or why. The unknown adds to our uneasiness.\nToday Americans lost our naive belief that we are safe from widespread terrorist attacks.\nAll of us, even in a small town such as Walla Walla, feel vulnerable.\nBut we also feel outraged.\nThe nation remains strong. People across the nation have, despite the horror we witnessed, remained calm. And the government is taking swift and appropriate action.\nAll flights have been grounded. Authorities have deployed military troops and the nation's most obvious targets, such as the White House, are under watch.\n\"Terrorism against our nation will not stand,\" vowed President Bush about an hour after the first attack.\nWe didn't want to believe this type of terrorist attack is possible.\nNow we know it is -- and the nation is preparing to fight back. When it is clear who is behind this act of war, the United States must take swift, decisive action.\nEditorials are the opinion of the Union-Bulletin's Editorial Board. The board is composed of Brian Hunt, Rick Eskil, James Blethen and Alasdair Stewart\n___ (c)2018 Walla Walla Union-Bulletin (Walla Walla, Wash.)
