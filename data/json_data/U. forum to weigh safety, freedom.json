How many innocent bystanders would be too many?\nHow far would you go to prevent a terrorist attack in your hometown? Would you be willing to let the government monitor your phone calls? To come into your home without your permission? To imprison you without charge?\nFour men who have spent much of their lives contemplating the balance between morality, national security and individual liberties - and who have come to different conclusions on how that balance should be struck - will gather for the annual Siciliano Forum at the University of Utah on Wednesday and Thursday.\nOne of the biggest stumbling points for those trying to answer the forum's central question - \"How far should we go to defend ourselves against terrorism?\" - is the expectation by Americans that terrorism can indeed be prevented, said Bruce Hoffman, former head of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency at the RAND Corporation.\n\"Part of the problem is that most of our leaders are not completely honest with us,\" said Hoffman, who will be on a panel of experts seeking to answer that question at Orson Spencer Hall's Reed Auditorium, 12:30 p.m. to 2 p.m. on Thursday. \"There are a lot of false expectations.\"\nHoffman is a Georgetown University professor and senior scholar at the University of Utah's Institute of Public and International Affairs. He will be joined by Chibli Mallat, professor at Utah's S.J. Quinney College of Law, who advocates a nonmilitary response to terrorism.\nHe says terrorists should be pursued not as military enemies, but as international criminals who have conducted crimes against humanity. He also promotes social and political solutions that might undermine the roots of terrorism. \"Could Osama bin Laden even be conceivable if Saudi Arabia were a democracy?\" Mallat asked.\nBut, he cautioned, democracy is unlikely to work if it is forced upon the Middle East.\nQuinney College professor Amos Guiora, an expert on international terrorism and former judge advocate general officer in the Israeli Defense Force, will also speak. The discussion will be moderated by PBS correspondent Margaret Warner.\nOn Wednesday night, Lee Hamilton, vice chairman of the 9/11 Commission and former chairman of the House Committee on International Relations, will speak at an invitation-only dinner at Utah's Rice-Eccles Stadium Varsity Club.\nmlaplante@sltrib.com\n\nLoad-Date: November 11, 2008"
