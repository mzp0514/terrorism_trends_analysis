The locomotive and a dozen passenger cars derailed near the city of Novgorod, about 300 miles north of the capital. \nIn all, 25 people were hospitalized after the derailment, and 35 sought treatment at the scene, Russian Railways said in a statement. \nThe bomb was placed about 100 feet ahead of where the tracks cross a bridge over a roadway. But the train crossed the bridge before going off the tracks; the casualty toll likely would have been significantly higher if the train had gone off the approximately 60-foot-high bridge. \n\nLoad-Date: August 15, 2007"
