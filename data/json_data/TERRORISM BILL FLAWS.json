    "full text": "WHEN civil liberties expert Nat Hentoff spoke in the Kanawha Valley\ntwice Saturday, he said Americans don't realize it, but they lost part\nof their freedom when President Clinton signed the Antiterrorism Act.\nSpecifically, Hentoff protested the act's curtailment of habeus corpus,\nthe principle that allows prisoners sentenced to death by state courts\nto appeal to federal courts.\nThis principle has nothing to do with terrorism such as the bombing of\nthe World Trade Center or the Oklahoma City federal building. The\ncurtailment was inserted in the terrorism act by death penalty advocates\nwho want states to execute prisoners more quickly.\n(There's something ugly about \"pro-death\" politicians - and most of them\ncall themselves \"pro-life\" on another hot issue.)\nHentoff said the cutback on habeus corpus - a basic human right\nguaranteed by Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution - will mean\nthat innocent people, or half-innocent ones, will be put to death.\nSince 1976, federal habeus corpus petitions have freed 54 people from\ndeath rows in state prisons. For example, the U.S. Supreme Court freed a\nLouisiana man last year after it was learned that his conviction was\nbased on an informant's lie - a lie that police had concealed.\nUnder the new antiterrorism bill, a condemned prisoner is allowed just\none habeus corpus appeal, which must be made hastily within a year after\nconviction. Under this limit, the Louisiana man would have been killed\nlong ago, because it took years to bring the false testimony to light.\nOther experts are denouncing other aspects of the Antiterrorism Act.\n\"This bill has little to do with fighting terrorism, and much to do with\ntaking freedoms from citizens and aliens,\" said Georgetown University\nlaw professor David Cole.\nHe said refugees fleeing from military dictatorships can be sent back by\na single immigration officer. Such aliens \"no longer have a right to a\nhearing,\" Cole said. \"There is no judicial review. And Congress added\nthat there can be no court challenge.\"\nWorse, some immigrants can be expelled on charges of having terrorist\nconnections, without being told the evidence against them.\n\"For the first time in 200 years, secret evidence will be allowed in a\nU.S. court,\" Cole said. \"It is impossible to challenge or refute\nevidence you cannot see.\"\nUnder the new law, Americans who give humanitarian aid to certain\nforeign reform groups can be jailed. Cole said:\n\"Think of the thousands of individuals in the '80s who gave money to\nsupport the African National Congress' stand against apartheid. ANC was\nconsidered a terrorist organization by the U.S. government. This bill\nwill unleash the FBI. It will cause the FBI to spend time looking into\npeople's peaceful, non-violent activities.\"\nThose caught supporting such groups may have their bank accounts frozen,\nwithout evidence of wrongdoing.\nCharles Levendosky of the Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune wrote: \"With this\nantiterrorism bill, America creeps relentlessly toward a police state.\"\nMaybe some of these alarms are too apprehensive. But freedom and\npersonal rights are treasures that must be protected against erosion.\nWe hope court rulings prevent the Antiterrorism Act from trampling on\nindividual liberties. And if courts can't do it, we hope West Virginia's\nmembers of Congress support revisions that will excise any Gestapo\nprovisions.\n\nLoad-Date: April 26, 1996"
