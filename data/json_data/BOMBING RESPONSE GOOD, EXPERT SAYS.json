    "full text": "He was going to talk about some obscure kind of medical injury\nBut after Wednesday's bombing and resulting carnage in Oklahoma\nCity, Dr. John Prescott dwelt on terrorism during his rounds at West\nVirginia University School of Medicine this morning.\n\"Bombing is the No. 1 terrorism act in the country,\" said\nPrescott, WVU chairman of emergency medicine and a disaster medicine\nspecialist.\n\"Oklahoma City is responding very well.\"\nJust a few years ago, chaos, rather than speedy reaction, might\nhave reigned after such an violent and spontaneous incident.\nToday, cities are planning for such attacks, he said.\n\"Life will go on. We are going back to work.  Terrorists will\nwin when we live in a state of fear.\"\nPrescott, who also serves as medical director of the state\nEmergency Medical Services, wrote a chapter on terrorism in a popular\ntextbook used in medical schools across the country.\nIn it, he said the U.S. remains vulnerable because of its\nworldwide geopolitical stance, its open borders, large size and free\nsociety with easy access.\nAnd terrorists like the media attention, too.\nThe bombing was discussed by Prescott and his medical students\nin several state locations on MD-TV, an interactive medical\ntelevision hookup.  They discussed how emergency medical personnel\nneed to be part of the planning, prepared for such events.\nHe said there's a low probability of a bombing occurring in West\nVirginia.\n\"But we must think about it, plan for it, be prepared and hope\nit never comes.\"\nSuch a bombing causes four major types of multiple casualties\nand the victims are not just the healthy, young males that are\nusually studied during wars.\nFirst are the primary blast effect injuries _ a body can be\nblown apart.  The force may cause traumatic amputations or transform\noffice furniture or a person into missiles.\nThe concussion can affect organs differently, he said, depending\non the bomb's location.  It damages ear drums, lungs and intestines\nThere could be burns, inhalation injuries and psychological\ntrauma.\n\"Besides the traumatic event, victims will feel violated,\nvulnerable, out of control.  It takes a while for these things to\ncome back.\"\nIf a worker in the federal building is entrapped in the rubble,\nhe can survive for days, Prescott said.\nHowever, if crushed, muscle and tissue will break down as toxins\nspeed through the body, affecting the kidneys and heart.\nReminiscent of the Civil War, at least one field amputation has\noccurred, Preston said he heard.  \"It is used only in the most\nextreme circumstances.\"\nBill White, director of emergency services for Kanawha County,\nsaid that unlike many other U.S. cities, Charleston years ago began\naddressing what might be the response after a terrorist attack.\n\"Law enforcement, the sheriff and others created a civil\ndisturbance and terrorism plan,\" White said.\n\"Terrorism is here to stay,\" he said.\n\"You think you are prepared.  You plan.  You fantasize.  When\nit happens, it is a difficult situation.\n\"It has to be taken care of and it will.\"\n\"Life will go on. We are going back to work.  Terrorists will\nwin when we live in a state of fear.\" Dr.  John Prescott WVU\nchairmanof emergency medicine\n\"Terrorists will win when we live in a state of fear.\" Dr.\nJohn Prescott WVU chairmanof emergency medicine\n\nLoad-Date: April 21, 1995"
