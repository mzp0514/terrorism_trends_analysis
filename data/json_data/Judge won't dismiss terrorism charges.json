    "full text": "A federal judge has declined to dismiss charges against Minnesota terrorism suspect Mohamad K. Elzahabi, whose attorneys wanted the case dismissed after they learned that conversations with him in prison may have been recorded.\nElzahabi was charged with lying to federal agents about sending walkie-talkies to Pakistan, helping to get a Massachusetts driver's license for a man later convicted of plotting a bombing in Jordan and possessing fraudulent immigration documents.\nProsecutors wrote in a January letter that it was possible that privileged conversations could have been included inadvertently in round-the-clock recordings of Elzahabi in a prison cell as he awaited trial.\nThey said tapes and a computer hard drive had not been reviewed and so it was unknown whether any video or audio had been recorded.\nDefense attorneys argued that the charges should be thrown out, saying that Elzahabi's Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated and that he can't be effectively represented if he can't talk freely to his lawyers because he may be recorded.\nU.S. District Judge John Tunheim ruled this week that because it has not been established whether recordings were made and because the prosecution didn't knowingly intrude on the conversations, Elzahabi's rights were not violated.\nProsecutors could be sanctioned by the court if there is further monitoring of Elzahabi's communications with attorneys, Tunheim ruled.\n\nLoad-Date: May 11, 2007"
