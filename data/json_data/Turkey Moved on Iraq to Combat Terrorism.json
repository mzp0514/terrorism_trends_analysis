    "full text": "To the Editor:\nYour belated concern in \"Turkey Crosses a Line\" (editorial, March 23) over Iraq's territorial integrity, \"violated\" by the Turkish military operation is disingenuous, to say the least. It is also misinformed and suggests a visceral opposition to the Turkish Government.\nThe Turkish military was forced to move on a small area in Iraq precisely because the territorial integrity of Iraq in the north was ignored and abused by the Kurdistan Workers Party, or P.K.K., one of the world's bloodiest terrorist organizations. The vacuum of authority in northern Iraq allowed the P.K.K. to establish major bases from which it executed terrorist attacks on Turkish soil with impunity.\nThe decision to send forces into northern Iraq was not taken lightly. Turkey fulfilled its obligations to protect its innocent civilians from further attacks. Turkey is legally and morally justified in its actions, which is why the United States Government supported the operation.\nThe editorial refers to the \"legitimate American military purpose in northern Iraq\" to \"protect Kurdish civilians from Saddam Hussein's forces.\" I hope you would someday display a similar humanitarian compassion for protecting Turkish civilians from P.K.K. terrorism as well.\nNo country in the region and in the world is more sensitive than Turkey about the preservation of Iraq's territorial integrity. The Turkish military operation is simply aimed at eliminating a terrorist menace.\n \nNUZHET KANDEMIR\nAmbassador of Turkey\nWashington, March 24, 1995\n\nLoad-Date: March 30, 1995"
