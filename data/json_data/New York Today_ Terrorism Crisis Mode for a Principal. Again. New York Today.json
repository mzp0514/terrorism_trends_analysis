    "full text": "Good morning on this warming Thursday.\nAs the principal of P.S. 89 in Lower Manhattan, Veronica Najjar has guided her school through two terrorist attacks.\nOn Sept. 11, 2001, she was standing in the schoolyard, when she said she saw the first plane slam into the North Tower of the World Trade Center.\n“I snapped into crisis mode,” said Ms. Najjar, 60, on Wednesday, thinking back to the day. She gathered students and teachers and led them a mile away to P.S. 3 in the West Village. “It was terrifying, but I was really calm.”\nSixteen years later, another deadly terrorist attack in Manhattan. On Tuesday afternoon, a man driving a truck killed 8 people and injured 12 others, before            crashing into a school bus in front of the elementary school. The attack happened right after school let out, with some of the school’s 433 children outside in the schoolyard.\nMs. Najjar said she heard screaming from her second-floor office. By the time she arrived downstairs, teachers had pulled the students, and some adults, into the building. Ms. Najjar quickly placed the school on lockdown.\nBut Ms. Najjar didn’t stop moving. She alternated between calming frantic parents gathered outside of the school and complimenting the children hunkered down in the cafeteria on their listening skills. She thanked them for their patience.\n“With kids, they can feel more of the panic when their adult is also panicked,” she said. “I also had to let the parents know that it was their job to stay calm so that their kids would stay calm. Because with kids, it’s often the aftermath that has ripple effects.”\nNone of the children at P.S. 89 were injured in the attack.\nNow the hard work begins, she said. Again.\nIn the coming days, teachers will be dispelling rumors and keeping an eye out for unusual behavior – atypical silence, ceaselessly talking about the attack, sleep problems, exaggerated clinginess. The school has brought in extra counselors to help.\nBut there’s one word you won’t hear her staff mention: “Terrorism.” The students are too young, Ms. Najjar said.\n“We just make sure that we’re giving kids the facts that are not overly explicit or overly graphic,” she said. “When you stick to the facts with kids, without giving them any embellishment or emotion with it, they are usually very satisfied. They just want to know that you’re being truthful with them.”\nRead more Times coverage of the attack, including articles on theinvestigation,            victims,            alleged attacker,            president’s response, and            officer who ended the rampage           .\nHere’s what else is happening:\nWeather\nAnd just like, that our “hotumn” is back.\nTemperatures could jump to 70 today and the sun will put in lots of face time.\nStill, throw on a jacket this morning — it should hover around 60 for the a.m. commute.\nIn the News\n Lt.

The 80-year-old, 75-foot-tall Norway spruce, from State College, Pa., is 50 feet wide and weighs between 12 and 13 tons.\nIt still has its roots in the ground, for the moment. It won’t arrive to the city until Nov. 11.\nSince 2010, the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree has been selected by one man: Erik Pauze, Rockefeller Center’s head gardener.\nHe spends months scouring back roads along the East Coast, he said, until he finds one worthy of the honor. But he’s had his eye on this year’s special spruce for a while.\nMr. Pauze found it on the side of the road on his way to watch his son play football in Sept. 2010, but it needed time to mature, he said. When he revisited the tree this year it was looking lush and green.\n“It has a nice perfect shape, it looks great from all the angles when you walk around it, and it was really full,” he told us. “I thought, ‘This is the year to take it.’”\nSo he will, on Nov. 9. That’s when the tree, which was donated by Jason Perrin, will be cut it down. When it arrives in the big city, its fragrant needles will be decorated with 50,000 lights, topped with a Swarovski star, and then lit up on Nov. 29.\nNew York Today is a morning roundup that is published weekdays at 6 a.m. If you don’t get it in your inbox already, you can sign up to receive it by email here.\nFor updates throughout the day, like us on Facebook.\nWhat would you like to see here to start your day?
