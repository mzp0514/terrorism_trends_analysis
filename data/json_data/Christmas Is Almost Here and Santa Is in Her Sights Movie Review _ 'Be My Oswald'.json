    "full text": "A seriously deranged dramedy about finding yourself through terrorism, “Be My Oswald”  attempts high-wire artiness on a bargain-basement budget. This works for 15 of the film’s 94  minutes, suggesting that somewhere inside this labor of lunacy lies a solidly engaging short film.\n In an exhaustingly high-strung performance, the talented Jeannie Noth shoulders most of the burden as A, an unfulfilled socialite fleeing a husband and a life of privilege. Embarking on what she believes to be a start-up humanitarian enterprise, A follows the telephone instructions of her unseen employer, the first of which is to secure a sixth-floor loft with a Broadway view. But when she discovers that the architect of her new life is a bewigged psychotic with plans to assassinate Santa during a Thanksgiving Day parade, A must table her urgent need for a manicure to summon principles she never knew she had. \n Written and directed by Don Cato (whose wife, Katha, plays the Bible-obsessed assassin), “Be My Oswald” opens promisingly but degenerates rapidly. Shot on 16-millimeter film, the early, loft-hunting scenes — featuring a series of  landlords familiar to any New Yorker — have an energy and professionalism that evaporate once the medium changes to digital video.  By the time the focus narrows to the socialite, the killer and a stuffed cat,  not even Santa  can reclaim our attention.\nBE MY OSWALD\nOpens today in Manhattan. \nWritten and directed by Don Cato; director of photography, Joe Dell’Olio; edited by Patrick DiRenna; music by James Halfpenny; produced by Mr. Cato and Katha Cato; released by ChipAway Productions. At the Two Boots Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street, at Avenue A, East Village. Running time: 1 hour 34 minutes.
