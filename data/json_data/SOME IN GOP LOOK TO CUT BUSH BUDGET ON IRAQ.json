    "full text": "House Republican leaders yesterday said they may cut some nonmilitary parts of President Bush's $82 billion budget request for Iraq and anti-terrorism efforts because they are not emergencies.\n The sharp comments they made in challenging the budget request marked an abrupt departure from the deference Republicans have shown Bush on earlier war funding.\nParty members said they are determined to reassert their authority over the budget at a time when the White House is accusing lawmakers of being big spenders.\n The main target of the rebellious Republicans is a request for $658 million to build what would be the largest embassy in the world: a fortress in Baghdad's Green Zone that would replace the former palace complex that U.S. officials are using.\n Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, in appearances on Capitol Hill, faced repeated questions from Republicans on whether the administration is trying to sneak through expenses as emergencies so they would undergo less scrutiny.\n House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., told reporters that last week's request -- which includes ongoing military and intelligence operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, anti-terrorism operations and tsunami relief -- will get a careful \"scrubbing.\"\n Several Republican lawmakers said the $658 million embassy in Baghdad appeared to be a clearly foreseeable capital expense that did not belong in an emergency budget.\n\nLoad-Date: February 17, 2005"
