    "full text": "Terrorist attacks worldwide shot up more than 25 percent last year, killing 40 percent more people than in 2005, particularly in Iraq, where extremists used chemical weapons and suicide bombers to target crowds, the State Department said Monday.\nAmong countries, Iran remains the biggest supporter of terrorism, with elements of its government backing groups throughout the Middle East, notably in Iraq, giving material aid and guidance to Shiite insurgent groups that have attacked Sunnis, U.S. and Iraqi forces, it said.\nIn its annual global survey of terrorism, the department said 14,338 attacks took place in 2006, mainly in Iraq and Afghanistan. That was 3,185 more than in 2005 -- a 28.5 percent increase.\nThese strikes killed 20,498, 13,340 of them in Iraq, 5,800 more, or a 40.2 percent increase over last year, it said.\nDespite the grim figures, State Department officials pointed to some successes in the war on terror, including improved counterterrorism cooperation with various nations and the thwarting of numerous plots, notably plans to down trans-Atlantic airliners.\nThe report partly attributes the higher casualty figures to a 25 percent jump in the number of nonvehicular suicide bombings targeting large crowds. That overwhelmed a 12 percent dip in suicide attacks involving vehicles.\n\nLoad-Date: May 2, 2007"
