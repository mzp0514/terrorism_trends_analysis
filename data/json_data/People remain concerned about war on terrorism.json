It is a scary time we are living in. With the approach of Sept. 11th, I so much have the desire to stay home from work and keep my child home from schoolâ€¦  to stay huddled together with my family and loved ones.\nI often think about the shock of the ordeal of having our country attacked. I, for one, very stupidly never thought our country would be attacked. I will never forget last Sept. 11th, nor do I want to forget. We can't forget!\nHowever, the dwindling of flags might be that like your top article (same back page) suggests: \"The public's confidence in the war on terrorism is slipping!\" I think a lot of people perhaps do not want to see more people killed. War is ugly.\nIt's ugly, but so was Sept. 11th! Others are worried about playing a cat and mouse game. It is just a very scary time.\nBut do we still love America? You bet! And we can only hope that God watches over us all.\nBlenda F. Rice\nLancaster\n\nLoad-Date: September 7, 2002"
