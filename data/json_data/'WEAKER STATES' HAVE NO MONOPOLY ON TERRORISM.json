    "full text": "To the Editor:\n Edward R. Luttwak is justifiably incensed by ''the recent upsurge of lawlessness'' in the form of ''terrorism such as the mining of the Red Sea'' (Op-Ed Aug. 15). He asks what we can expect ''when we fail to enforce even the most minimal standards of international conduct.''\nThe enforcement Mr. Luttwak has in mind involves punishment and deterrence, by the great powers, of the ''reckless, weaker states and their subjects'' as a way to regain ''such international order as we have known in the past.''\nGiven the contribution of the great powers to the past\nbreakdown\n \n of that international order, one wonders at Mr. Luttwak's silence about the need of the great powers to restrain their own conduct according to the standards he advocates.\nApplied in the U.S., such standards would have kept our Administration, from the start, out of the mining business it, too, undertook when the C.I.A. planned and directed operations in Nicaraguan harbors between January and April of this year, before Congress intervened.  Those standards of international conduct are incompatible also with the support of the contras' brutal and destructive invasion of Nicaragua, and with the refusal of the U.S. Administration to accept for two years the jurisdiction of the World Court in Central American cases where the U.S. would be defendant.  This is not to excuse or condone the terrorism of others, but rather to question whether the international order can be served by Mr. Luttwak's double standard of conduct - one for the weak and another for the strong.\n \nPETER H. JUVILER Professor of Political Science Barnard College New York, Aug. 16, 1984"
