    "full text": "Wednesday, Nov. 26, Richard A. Clarke, former chief counter terrorism adviser on the National Security Council under President Clinton and President George W. Bush, came to Florida State University to kick off The National Security Lecture Series, sponsored by the FSU Center for the Advancement of Human Rights.\nHis discussion covered the \"National Security and the War Against Terror.\" Clarke resigned from his position at the National Security Council in January 2003 because he was unhappy with the Bush administration's Iraq policy. In 2004, he authored a memoir titled \"Against All Enemies: Inside America's War on Terror,\" that discussed the United States government's position on terrorism before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the later decision to invade Iraq.\nIn his discussion, Clarke said that the invasion of Iraq opened the door to Iran as a major threat to stability in the Middle East. Clarke said he believes that taking the offense in attacking Iran is not going to solve any problems.\n\"I think we ought to talk with Iran,\" said Clarke. \"You never know what could happen when you sit across from the table with someone and negotiate.\"\nClarke said he would like the United States to pull its troops out of Iraq, try to use diplomatic means to deal with Iran, and that the United States needs to elect a president who believes strongly in the constitution.\nClarke is currently a supplemental lecturer in public policy at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.\n(C) 2007 FSView & Florida Flambeau via U-WIRE\n\nLoad-Date: December 3, 2007"
