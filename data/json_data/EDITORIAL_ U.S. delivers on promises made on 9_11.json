    "full text": "May 03--Celebrating the loss of any life just feels wrong in many ways, but we must remember that Osama bin Laden wasn't a human being at all by the standards that most of us would apply.\nThis was a man who didn't lose sleep over ordering the deaths of thousands of innocent men, women and children. This was a man who reveled in murder, chaos and destruction. This was a man who had no morals and placed no value on human life whatsoever.\nThat makes it very difficult for most of us to feel sorry for his death after word came late Sunday night and into early Monday morning that bin Laden had been killed during a U.S. strike.\nMuch of our nation and many people across the world celebrated -- and rightfully so.\nAlthough the best outcome would have been for bin Laden to stand trial in a world court for his many crimes against humanity, we have to feel that justice was served.\nHis death doesn't bring back any of the innocent victims who were killed during 9/11 or any other terrorist attacks. It does nothing to alleviate the heartache and loss felt by countless families.\nIt does close a chapter in the war on terrorism and sends a strong message to others.\nThe United States of America will not tolerate terrorism and we will not stop until justice is served.\nTo see more of The Ironton Tribune or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.irontontribune.com/.
