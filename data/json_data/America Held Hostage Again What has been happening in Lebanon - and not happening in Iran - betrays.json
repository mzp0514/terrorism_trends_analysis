    "full text": "Also noteworthy is the fact that Syria promptly freed the fleeing Mr. Levin, as if to distance itself from the kidnappers in its region of influence. And this brought Mr. Reagan's call of appreciation to a Government that usually appears high on his list of regimes promoting terrorism.\nThe President plainly hopes for more Syrian help.\nOld memories of odd ''private'' ambassadors are really stirred by the recent arrival in Beirut of Muhammad Ali to lend a hand. But there is no point mocking this desperate diplomacy, as there was no point in mocking Jimmy Carter's. These efforts underscore the difficulties of dealing with unscrupulous adversaries who offer no easy target for reprisal. Clearly, Lebanon is not an appropriate target for Secretary of State Shultz's recent desire to ''isolate, weaken or punish states that sponsor terrorism against us.''\nBut what of Iran, which does have an all- powerful Government? Ten weeks have passed since its soldiers ostentatiously stormed a hijacked Kuwaiti airliner to seize four hijackers who had killed two Americans. It won't extradite them and has made no move to bring them to trial. That is a violation of the Hague Convention against the unlawful seizure of aircraft, which Iran signed.\nHarboring hijackers is a threat against all air travelers, and Iran offers an excellent target for lawful and appropriate reprisal: the suspension of air service. Forbidding flights to and from Iran would hurt, and it would hurt even more if pressure is applied to make other nations join the boycott. Action in Lebanon is plainly difficult, but inaction toward Iran seems inexplicable."
