This is a possibility,'' Mr. Oelssner said.\nAnother option that has been discussed in the past would be for the creation of a pan-European terrorism insurance vehicle that would provide consistency of coverage across the continent for buyers, particularly those with cross-border exposures.\nBoth Mr. Oelssner and Leberecht Funk, chairman of Hamburg-based brokerage Funk Gruppe G.m.b.H. and head of the Verband der Deutschen Versicherungsmakler, say the Treasury's decision could be swayed by the outcome of similar discussions in the United States.\nIf the U.S. government decides that U.S. businesses can cope with terror risk through the use of open market insurance coverage, then the German government may follow suit and see no reason to extend its financial backing of EXTREMUS, they said.\nBut they say that the recent arrests show the need for the coverage to be continued.\n``As there are no signs of a decline of terrorism risks-rather the contrary-it is important that the EXTREMUS concept will be continued for Germany. I am therefore confident that a prolongation will be achieved in September this year,'' said Mr. Zagel.\n``After an event, there has to be some security there and I do not see that without support from the government...because there is not sufficient capacity out there,'' said Christian Hinsch, chairman of the operating board of insurer H.D.I. Industrie Verischerung in Hanover.\nMr. Hinsch said that both the German insurance association-Gesamtverband der Deutschen Versicherungswirtschaft e.V.-and the DVS are lobbying hard for the continuation of the government backing for EXTREMUS for good reason.\n``Other countries share. We insurance professionals and customers believe it is necessary, but the government thinks it is not necessary, maybe because there have not been any major attacks in Germany. But we need to take a longer-term view than that,'' he said.\n``There is increased terror capacity in the private insurance sector, but this can vanish very quickly. And also the capacity EXTREMUS can offer, though limited in territorial scope, is second-to-none,'' said Mr. Funk.\nFranz Hertl, head of German business at Germany-based Munich Reinsurance Co., said that he believed that weak demand from buyers was a factor in the uncertainty about EXTREMUS' future.\n``Of course, we would like an extension and I am quite sure the government will extend the guarantee,'' Mr. Hertl said. ``But the buying companies, which really need EXTREMUS, need to support and demand the cover.''\n\nGraphic\n\n \nArt Credit: A German police officer watches passengers checking in last November at Frankfurt airport, which along with a U.S. military base were intended targets of an alleged terrorist plot that resulted in arrests last week, authorities said.\nArt Credit: AP\n\nLoad-Date: September 15, 2007"
