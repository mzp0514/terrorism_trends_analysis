I want to thank our federal, state and local law enforcement officers, and Georgia's National Guard, who are on the ground protecting our lawful right of expression, as well as our property and safety.\"\n\"Peaceful demonstrations throughout the Southern District in recent weeks have been a model for appropriate exercises of citizens' constitutional right to express their grief and concerns,\" Bobby L. Christine, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Georgia, said. \"If anyone, whether locals or outside individuals, escalates to unlawful behavior and disrupts our communities, we stand ready to assist local law enforcement with federal resources to safeguard the lives and property of our citizens.\"\n\"The FBI is dedicated to protecting our citizens and upholding the Constitution,\" said Chris Hacker, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. \"The Constitution gives every citizen the right to protest peacefully, but when a few people abuse the rights of the many peaceful protesters by stoking violence and destroying property, we must enforce the law.\n\"Federal prosecutions are a tool we will use to assist our state and local law enforcement partners who are on the front lines trying to maintain order.\"\nBarr's statement is available here: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-william-p-barrs-statement-riots-and-domestic-terrorism.\n___ (c)2020 The Albany Herald, Ga.
