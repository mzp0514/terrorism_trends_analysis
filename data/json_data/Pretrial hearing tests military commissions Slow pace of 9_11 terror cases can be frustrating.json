James Pohl, the presiding military judge, has set aside a full week at the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to consider a range of potentially toxic legal arguments that continue to test the government's authority to prosecute the terror suspects by military commission.\nThere are defense requests for information on some of the government's most sensitive operations, including what it calls enhanced interrogation methods and the shuffling of suspects among a former network of \"black sites,\" or secret prisons.\nThe case provides one of the most vexing legal quandaries of the terrorism wars: Are Guantanamo's military commissions the proper venues in which to prosecute al-Qaeda operatives?\n\"This is methodical. It's deliberate,\" Army Brig. Gen. Mark Martins, the chief prosecutor at Guantanamo Bay,  told USA TODAY, referring to the commission process. \"I'm sure it's frustrating to people watching it, but I'm seeing substantial movement.\"\nOther legal analysts are less charitable.\n\"It's been such a disaster,\" said retired Air Force colonel Morris Davis, a former chief prosecutor at Guantanamo. \"Months ago, (Attorney General) Eric Holder said it was a mistake to have referred these cases to military commissions from federal court. He was right. These trials would have been done years ago\" in federal court.\nHolder sought in 2009 to try Mohammed and his alleged associates in a New York City federal courtroom. Vocal opposition from then-mayor Michael Bloomberg, 9/11 victims' families and lawmakers forced Holder to abandon the plan, sending the case back into the largely untested military commission system. No trial date has been set.\nPohl has been confronted with issues ranging from the seemingly frivolous -- whether Mohammed could wear a camouflage vest in court -- to the extraordinary, including the discovery of listening devices in the attorney-client meeting rooms.\nSome legal analysts said the system's flaws are primarily rooted in the earliest days of the terror wars, when suspects were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques such as water-boarding and shuttled among secret detention sites around the globe before they landed at Guantanamo.\nGovernment and defense lawyers in the current case continue to battle over what classified information the suspects are entitled to know about conditions of their confinement and treatment immediately after their capture.\nAttorneys for Mohammed did not respond to requests for comment. But Martins said the commissions are \"necessary to deal with crimes and evidence in situations of hostilities, something all three branches of our government agree applies to our armed conflict with al-Qaeda.''\n\"Military courts have been our traditional forum,\" Martins said. \"Though surely effective in dispensing justice in the vast majority of crimes, including terrorism offenses, federal courts have not tried these kinds of cases much. And since 2010, military commissions are the only lawful forum to try these defendants. We aim to do so, and to do so fairly and in accordance with our values.\"\nDavis said the federal courts have proved more capable venues to prosecute terrorism suspects. Since the military commission system was authorized in the shadow of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, seven people have been tried and convicted. In federal court, more than 400 people have been convicted of terrorism or terror-related charges since 2001. Among them: Zacarias Moussaoui, who in 2005 pleaded guilty to conspiring with al-Qaeda in the 9/11 attacks. In 2006, he was sentenced to life in prison.\nEdward MacMahon, the lead defense attorney in the Moussaoui case, said you can't compare the federal court system and military commissions. \"One of them (federal court) is actually a system. In the other, they make the rules up as they go.\" \n\nGraphic\n\n \nphoto sketches by Janet Hamlin via AP\n\nLoad-Date: June 16, 2014"
