The years of therapy and rehabilitation for those whose lives have been destroyed by the violence of terror cannot be summed up in dollars and cents.\nThe further victimization that occurs when you realize that you are now fighting the government bureaucracy simply to get the help you need to survive leaves one totally disillusioned and defeated. My family has been there.\nI call upon President-elect Donald Trump and the next Congress to come together and create a vehicle to care for all victims of terror. The terrorists attacked Americans, not San Bernardinians, Bostonians or New Yorkers. Terrorism is a national issue, and Americans should not have to beg for care.\nEach one should be embraced by our country not just by being called heroes who are given a plaque or a parade, and then forgotten, but by making their care and rehabilitation the moral responsibility of every one of us.\nFind the funding to help: That is the obligation of Congress and the president. The time of delay and excuses is past.\nBARBARA ROSEN\nNew York\nThe writer is the wife of Barry Rosen, the former United States Embassy press attach√© in Tehran who was taken hostage by Iranian militants in 1979.\n\nLoad-Date: December 8, 2016"
