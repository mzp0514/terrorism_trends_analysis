It’s unclear who sent them or what the motive was. \nBut I will say this: President Trump and his allies continue to talk about violence in completely irresponsible ways. That will remain true regardless of what we eventually learn about this incident. Jeff Zucker, the president of CNN, made this point in a statement yesterday. My colleagues            Charles Blow and            Bret Stephens have also made it.\nSome of Trump’s allies were quick to claim that the attacks were “false flag” operations, carried out by Democrats. “It’s obviously fine to withhold judgment on the attacks until law enforcement addresses more of the public’s questions,” writes Tiana Lowe in the conservative Washington Examiner. But “the rush from some on the Right to use a lack of facts to justify promulgating ridiculous conspiracy theories is both fallacious and irresponsible.”\n[Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]\nVoter suppression. Republicans are engaged in an aggressive effort to prevent Americans from voting:\nI find this anti-voter campaign to be an outrageous injustice, and it’s the main subject of the new episode of our podcast, “The Argument.” During the conversation, Michelle Goldberg puts voter suppression into the larger context of            “minority rule,” and Ross Douthat argues that progressives like Michelle and me are overly focused on voting rules. The Democrats’ bigger problem, he says, is persuading people to want to vote for them. \nNext week’s episode will be our last one before the midterm elections.

Newkirk II in The Atlantic. “Proactive national measures to prevent disenfranchisement have all but been eliminated in the past five years,” Newkirk writes. “The effort needed to reestablish a guarantee of voting rights and put the disenfranchisement genie back in the bottle will be massive.”\nPHOTO: Republicans have purged voters from the rolls, enacted voter identification laws and closed polling places in states across the country.
