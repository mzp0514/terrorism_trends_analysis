We're not terrorists.\nProblem is, \"terrorism\" has become a slippery term. In May, a federal court jailed a peaceful, Bible-quoting nun for trespassing at a nuclear weapons production facility because, the judge said, she had committed a terrorist act.\nSome of us worship in congregations that proclaim the same Jesus that got that nun into trouble.\nSome of us work to save the planet from certain collapse if we don't leave most existing fossil fuel reserves in the ground.\nSome of us stand in public opposition to our government's highest goal: global domination of land, sea, air, space and communications.\nSome of us support the boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign against companies doing business in areas illegally occupied by the State of Israel.\nSome of us stand committed to holding government accountable to the Constitution and the rights to peacefully assemble, bear arms and carry on a private life\nIf a nun who peacefully challenges the morality of building more nuclear weapons is a terrorist, then many of us are at risk. Now is the time to make our voices heard.\nBerry Friesen\nManheim Township\n\nLoad-Date: June 20, 2013"
