    "full text": "Six Middle Easterners linked to an international bombing suspect facing charges in the United States pleaded innocent Thursday to charges of illegal possession of firearms and explosives.\nPolice have accused the six of being international terrorists who planned to carry out attacks in the Philippines against U.S. and Saudi Arabian targets.\nThey said the six had been trained by Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, a primary suspect in the World Trade Center bombing in New York in 1993.\nThe six terrorism suspects, who carried Jordanian, Syrian and Omani passports, were arraigned as some government officials expressed concern that the country was becoming a training ground for international terrorists.\nEarlier this month, police arrested Abdul Hakim Murad, a terrorist suspect, and turned him over to U.S. authorities.\nThe six most recent suspects were captured April 1 in a raid outside Manila during which police seized guns, explosives, timers, detonating devices, computer disks, radical Islamic brochures and tapes of Egyptian Sheikh Omar Abdul Rahman. Rahman, like Yousef, is on trial in the United States on charges related to the World Trade Center bombing.\nYousef, who was arrested in Pakistan in February and turned over to U.S. authorities, also has been linked to plots to assassinate Pope John Paul II during the pontiff's visit to Manila in January and to bomb commercial airline flights in Asia.\nPolice have tied Yousef and the six suspects to the fundamentalist Abu Sayyaf group, accused in the raid on the southern Philippine town of Ipil on April 4, which left 53 dead and more than 40 wounded.\n\nLoad-Date: April 22, 1995"
