    "full text": "HARRISBURG -- Gov. Ed Rendell rescinded a policy Friday that had kept the state's list of polling places hidden from the public because of terrorism fears. \nRendell's abrupt decision came a day after The Associated Press reported on the policy set by Pennsylvania's Department of State, which said it was influenced by the terrorist bombings that struck just days before Spain's national elections in 2004. Election officials consulted with state police, the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency and the state Office of Homeland Security before deciding to withhold the list. \nCritics said concealing the compiled list runs afoul of the state's open records law and would complicate statewide efforts to mobilize voters. \nThe governor noted that the information is already publicly available through county elections offices, Rendell spokesman Chuck Ardo said. \n\"The governor believes that revoking the policy will not have a material effect on Election Day safety,\" Ardo said. \nOn Friday, the top Republicans in the state Senate sent a letter to the Democratic governor urging him to reconsider the policy, and House Republican Leader Sam Smith separately called on the governor to do so. \n\"While the government should take reasonable cautions against terrorism, we should not use terrorism as an excuse to curtail the vote,\" Smith said. \n\nLoad-Date: October 27, 2007"
