Speaking after the blast on Wednesday, he vowed to continue his political work.\nThe peace talks will be held in Qatar's capital, Doha.\nMatt Hancock blames British public for shortfall in coronavirus testing capacity\nThe rule is applicable to people in private homes, indoor and outdoor spaces, pubs, restaurants, houses of worship and cafes.

No group immediately claimed responsibility for the incident, with the Taliban in a statement denying their involvement.\nThe so-called Islamic State group has also launched numerous high-profile attacks in Afghanistan in recent years.
