    "full text": "Alfonse M. D'Amato said yesterday that Federal funds for law enforcement should be used to maintain and strengthen police forces rather than for ''questionable social programs for criminals.''\nIn a position paper titled ''Carnage in the Streets,'' Mr. D'Amato, a candidate for the United States Senate from New York, said that crime in the nation had jumped 9.1 percent last year and that 621,110 serious crimes had been committed last year in New York City alone.\nAN-AHe said that with many crimes unsolved and others reduced to lesser offenses in the city, ''the odds against going to jail for a serious crime were 99 to 1.''\nMr. D'Amato, the Republican candidate, proposed restoration of the death penalty for murders and the diversion of Federal anti-crime funds for the hiring of police officers.\nHe charged that his Democratic opponent, Representative Elizabeth Holtzman, had opposed bills imposing the death penalty for some ''skyjackers'' and legislation to implement the International Convention to Prevent and Punish Acts of Terrorism and a Federal $50,000 death benefit who died in the line of duty.\nMiss Holtzman, who spent much of yesterday on the telephone raising campaign funds, said she had been ''a leader in the Congress in fighting crime'' and that she would announce later this week ''a major law enforcement grant for the state.''\nShe said Mr. D'Amato's had expressed in several debates opposition to control of ''Saturday Night specials,'' the small handguns. ''That makes him part of the problem, not the solution,'' she said.\nThe third candidate Senator Jacob K. Javits, also spent considerable time yesterday fund-raising."
