    "full text": "FBI Director Robert Mueller is seeking to address some of the flaws exposed by the attacks of Sept. 11 by creating a new terrorism-fighting team in Washington that will oversee all terrorism investigations worldwide, officials say.\nMueller is informing the agents who supervise each field office across the country this week of the plan, which is designed to centralize terrorism fighting and ensure all intelligence is evaluated thoroughly and urgently and compared against other information gathered by the government, officials said Tuesday.\nThe officials, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, said the plan is part of a broader reorganization Mueller started last fall to reshape his agency in the aftermath of the new terrorism threat and the Ro bert Hanssen spy case.\nThe plan received quick endorsement from Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who said after a congressional meeting with President George W. Bush on Wednesday: \"The idea that you have this super unit in Washington … makes sense to me.\"\nAlluding to reports that the FBI received warnings of suicide hijackings before Sept. 11, Lott said, \"If you have information in Phoenix and information in Minneapolis - if there's no place where that is put together, it's not worth very much to you.\"\nThe program's aim, officials said, is to change a terrorism-fighting structure inside the FBI that often stretched thin the expertise of the New York field office. That office handled the high-profile cases of the 1990s involving the bombings of the World Trade Center and U.S. embassies in Africa.\nThe new plan would create an expert team in Washington that would direct all terrorism investigations, centralize the evaluation of intelligence and threats, and ensure that leads aren't lost inside the government bureaucracy, the officials said.\nThe reorganization comes as the FBI faces tough scrutiny from Congress about how much it knew before Sept. 11 about the threat of a terrorist strike.\nThe Associated Press reported this month that FBI headquarters did not act on a memo last July from its Arizona office warning that a large number of Arabs were seeking pilot, security and airport operations training at at least one U.S. flight school. The memo also urged a check of all flight schools to identify more possible Middle Eastern students.\n\nLoad-Date: May 16, 2002"
