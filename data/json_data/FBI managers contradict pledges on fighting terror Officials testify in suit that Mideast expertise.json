It would be nice.\"\n\"You need leadership. You don't need subject-matter expertise,\" Bald testified in an ongoing FBI employment case. \"It is certainly not what I look for in selecting an official for a position in a counterterrorism position.\"\nIn a development that has escaped public attention, FBI agent Bassem Youssef has questioned under oath many of the FBI's top leaders, including Director Robert Mueller and his predecessor, Louis Freeh, in an effort to show he was passed over for top terrorism jobs despite his expertise. Testimony from his lawsuit recently was sent to Congress.\nThose who have had the bureau's top terrorism-fighting jobs since Sept. 11 often said in their testimony that they -- and many they have promoted since -- had no significant experience in terrorism- or Middle East-related issues. Some could not even explain the difference between Sunnis and Shiites, the two primary groups of Muslims.\n\"Probably the strongest leader I know in counterterrorism has no counterterrorism in his background,\" Bald said.\nThe hundreds of pages of testimony obtained by The Associated Press contrast with assurances Mueller repeatedly has given Congress that he was building a new FBI from top to bottom with experts able to stop terrorist attacks before they occur, not solve them afterward.\n\"The FBI's shift toward terrorism prevention necessitates the building of a national-level expertise and body of knowledge,\" Mueller told Congress a year after the suicide hijackings, as lawmakers approved billions of new dollars to fight terrorism.\nDespite the testimony of its managers, the FBI said it has fundamentally reshaped itself to ensure the field agents on the ground who work the cases have the necessary skills, training and background for fighting terrorism. It noted it hired or redeployed more than 1,000 agents to counterterrorism and hired an additional 1,200 intelligence analysts and linguists.\n\"We fundamentally changed the criteria for hiring special agents and intelligence analysts to ensure that we get the critical skills, knowledge and experience we need to address today's threats,\" Assistant Director Cassandra Chandler said.\nDaniel Byman, a national security expert who worked on both congressional and presidential investigations of terrorism and intelligence failures, reviewed the Youssef case for the court. Byman concluded the spurned agent is one of the government's most-skilled terrorism fighters, and the FBI overall remains weak in expertise on the Middle East, terrorism and intelligence liaison.\nWatson, who oversaw the first two years of transformation, testified he could not recall a single meeting in the aftermath of Sept. 11 in which FBI leaders discussed the type of skills or training needed for counterterrorism.\nWhen asked whether he, as the FBI's former counterterrorism chief, could describe the differences between Shiite and Sunni Muslims, Watson answered, \"Not technically, no.\"\n\nNotes\n\n KEY FIGURES IN FIGHT ON TERROR   \n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO\n photo - Freeh    photo - Watson    photo - Mueller    photo - Bald \n\nLoad-Date: June 20, 2005"
