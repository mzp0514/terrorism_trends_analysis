    "full text": "Bokajan: As India remains on the boil after the Pulwama Terror Attack which claimed the lives of 44 CRPF jawans; protest continues to rock several places in the country.\n\nThe bandh called by the trader's body also saw spontaneous nationwide support as traders kept their shutters down in condolence and tribute to the martyred CRPF jawans. Markets in the hill district of Karbi Anglong also wore a deserted look as peoples remained indoors to express solidarity with the family members of the martyred soldiers.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of agitated protesters blocked the NH 39 at Khatkhati along Assam-Nagaland border disrupting vehicular traffic over the highway.\n\nThe protesters including locals barred auto-rickshaws and transport from plying on the highway.\n\nThe protesters raised anti-terrorism slogans and demanded stern action against the neighbouring country Pakistan for sponsoring terrorism in the Kashmir valley.\n\nThe protesters also turned violent and charged several commercial vehicles moving past the highway.\n\nEfforts to contain the situation and clear the highway by the district administration and policing machinery yield no results.\n\nIt may be mentioned that the security personnel later had to resort to lathi-charge to disperse the agitated crowd. It took roughly four hours for regular services to resume on the highway.\n\nLoad-Date: February 19, 2019"
