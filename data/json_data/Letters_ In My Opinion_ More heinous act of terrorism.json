I do not agree, however, with the media that this was the greatest loss of life as a result of bombing to occur in America. Perhaps it is called the worst bombing because the fatalities included so many white Americans.\nFor the Journal-Constitution\nAgain, it appears that history affecting black Americans has been lost, stolen or strayed. According to data compiled by Ron Wallace and Jay Wilson titled \"A black Holocaust in America,\" Tulsa, Okla., was the scene of the deadliest bombing in the United Sates.\nIt was 80 years ago in Tulsa, on June 1, 1921, that a 36-square block business district called Greenwood and dubbed \"Black Wall Street\" was burned to the ground by white terrorist mobs in what has become known as the Tulsa Race Riot. In about 12 hours, the entire community of businesses and homes was destroyed. Included were restaurants, grocery stores, theaters, a bank, post office, schools, law offices, a bus system, hospital, 21 churches, pawn shops, brothels and a half-dozen private airplanes. It is noteworthy that in 1921, there were only two airports in the entire state of Oklahoma. Yet, six blacks in this community owned airplanes.\nAlthough some Internet sites and others claim that 3,000 black Americans were killed during the bomb-and-burn massacre, officials put the death toll between 75 and 300. The higher number obviously surpasses the toll in Oklahoma City. This was white America's terrorism at its worst.\nThe media's proclamation that the Oklahoma City bombing was the worst in United States history is a deliberate act in ignorance, and not from ignorance. The Tulsa bombing did happen.\n \nBOB MILES, Atlanta Bob Miles, originally from Savannah, is retired from the U.S. Army and the state of Georgia.\n \nSubmissions to this readers' column should run 300-350 words and include a recent photo of yourself, brief biography and a daytime phone number.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPhoto:\nBob Miles\n\nLoad-Date: June 19, 2001"
