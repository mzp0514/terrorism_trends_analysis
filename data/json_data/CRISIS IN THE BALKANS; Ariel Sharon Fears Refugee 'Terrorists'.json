    "full text": "Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon said today that an independent Kosovo could become a base for Islamic terrorism and further undermine stability in the Balkans.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu quickly distanced himself from Mr. Sharon, saying the Foreign Minister was expressing his personal views.\nMr. Netanyahu said Israel fully supported the NATO bombings of Yugoslavia, a view supported by the Defense Minister, Moshe Arens.\nOpposition leaders have accused the Netanyahu Government of increasing Israel's isolation by failing to stand by NATO and the United States.\nAddressing Jewish leaders in New York on Monday, Mr. Sharon said Kosovo might eventually win independence and then become part of \"a Greater Albania that will turn into a center of Islamic terrorism in Europe.\"\nAsked about his remarks in a telephone interview today with Channel 2 in Israel, Mr. Sharon said that while he supported the right of every people to self-determination, independence for Kosovo might be undesirable.\n\"If a big block of Muslim countries develops in this area, this could be the center of Islamic terrorism and the seed for this already exists there,\" he said.\nFour Israeli Air Force planes left Tel Aviv today loaded with aid for a vast refugee camp set up north of Skopje, the capital of Macedonia. Israel has already sent a 70-member medical team to help set up a hospital in the camp.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: April 7, 1999"
