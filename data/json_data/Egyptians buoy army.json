    "full text": "CAIRO -- Huge crowds on Friday heeded a general's call to oppose \"violence and terrorism,\" a sign that Egypt's military remains popular and potent three weeks since deposing a president. \nProsecutors said they are investigating ousted leader Mohamed Morsy on charges of espionage, murder and kidnapping. \nLt.Gen. Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, the army's chief and Egypt's defense minister, called for a nationwide demonstration to give the army and police a clear public mandate. \nHundreds of thousands did so, filling the capital's Tahrir Square and mobbing the main presidential palace. The turnout nationally was estimated as in the millions. \nMany hailed Sisi as a national hero. \nMorsy's supporters from the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist parties held competing rallies, and only minor scuffles were reported in this city of more than 20 million. \nIn coastal Alexandria, however, clashes killed five and injured about 150. \n\"We are all here to support what Sisi is doing to alleviate terrorism,\" said Samar Kandil as she walked with her family to a pro-military rally at the presidential palace. \nThe homemaker said, \"The army and the people are here to save Egypt from any kind of conspiracy,\" adding that she is not afraid of the Brotherhood or \"anybody else who is a terrorist.\" \nAt the palace and in Tahrir Square, demonstrators held signs praising the military and urging it to \"save\" the country from the Brotherhood. They waved national flags and posters of the general. \nChildren and young men wore Sisi masks; men wore T-shirts with his photo and the words, \"Your sons authorize you against terrorism.\" A kite with Sisi's likeness sailed overhead. \nOne man's sign portrayed Sisi and former Presidents Gamal Abdel Nasser and Anwar Sadat, both soldiers, too, as \"The falcons of the Arabs, the leaders of Egypt.\" \nArmy helicopters flew low overhead to the delight of the cheering, whistling crowds. Young men rushed to snatch Egyptian flags dropped from the craft. \nBut Brotherhood protesters scornfully chanted \"We don't want flags, we want Morsy\" and \"Down with military rule!\" when helicopters hovered over them. \nThe unabashed support for Sisi is not altogether surprising -- although what he intends to do with his sudden popularity is unclear. \nThe military has long been Egypt's most-respected institution. After a 2011 revolution toppled another regime, its popularity suffered only briefly when it bloodily repressed continued protests. \nWhen Morsy and the Brotherhood took power in 2012, street crime and other lawlessness escalated. And since Morsy's ouster, political unrest has claimed the lives of more than 200 people and injured thousands -- leaving Egyptians weary, afraid and desperate for security. \nAl Azhar, Egypt's center of Islamic teaching, and the Coptic Christian church endorsed the general's call for demonstrations. \nDespite the deep political divisions, all sides seem unified against the United States. \nIn Tahrir Square, one man held a poster of President Obama with an Islamic fundamentalist's beard and the words: \"A message from the Egyptian people to Obama, stop supporting terrorism.\" \nAt a Brotherhood rally, demonstrators accused the Obama administration of abandoning the democratically elected Morsy. \"Why are Americans agreeing with the coup?\" one man asked. \n\"Please tell Obama, we love our Sisi,\" said Shahinaz Ahmed, 36, an art director. \"We support Sisi to fight against terrorism in the Sinai. Every day we lose our best people from the army there. Every day here there is violence.\" \nShe said she hopes soldiers sweep Brotherhood protesters off the streets. \nIndeed, the Interior Ministry announced it would clear two Brotherhood sit-ins in the capital \"soon\" and in a \"legal\" manner, according to the government daily Al Ahram. \nEarlier in the day, Egyptian authorities said they are investigating charges that Morsy conspired with Hamas, the militant Palestinian organization, and other Islamists on a 2011 prison escape. He and about 30 other Brotherhood members were freed when Hamas gunmen attacked the prison northwest of Cairo, killing 14 guards. \nThe case includes murder and kidnapping allegations. \nMorsy has been held incommunicado since he was deposed July 3. \nBetsy Hiel is the Tribune-Review's foreign correspondent.
