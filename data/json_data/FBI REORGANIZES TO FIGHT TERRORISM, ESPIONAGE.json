    "full text": "WASHINGTON -- Criticized for missteps in investigations of alleged Chinese nuclear espionage and political contributions, the FBI is putting more managers to work catching and thwarting terrorists and spies.\nTwo new divisions were created Thursday by FBI Director Louis J. Freeh, with approval from Attorney General Janet Reno and Congress.\nOne, the Investigative Services Division, is designed to ensure that top FBI officials and investigators are aware of all relevant information scattered in case files around bureau divisions.\nAnother of its goals is to improve the bureau's analyses so the FBI can prevent crimes as well as solve them after they occur.\nThe other new entity, a Counterterrorism Division, carved out of the old National Security Division, was leaked by officials last summer.\nMonths in the making, the moves follow criticism from Congress, an executive branch commission and the Justice Department inspector general of the bureau's handling of two sensitive investigations involving China.\nThe bureau was said to have focused too narrowly, failed to distribute relevant leads to all its divisions and failed to keep top officials aware of key evidence.\n\"Protecting America from terrorism and ensuring our national security are the FBI's highest priorities,\" Freeh said.\n\"Given the complexity and difficulty of these threats, I have decided that counterterrorism and national security should be handled separately,\" he said.\nA bureau statement acknowledged that \"increased attention to terrorism had the effect of diluting senior management oversight given to the very real, systemic threat posed by espionage.\"\nIn recent years, the National Security Division established a National Infrastructure Protection Center to prepare for possible terrorist electronic attacks on U.S. computer systems and launched a National Domestic Preparedness Office to train local agencies to respond to terrorist attacks by computer, nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.\n\"The buildup strained the capacity of the National Security Division to adequately oversee both counterterrorism and counterintelligence,\" the FBI said.\n\nLoad-Date: November 12, 1999"
