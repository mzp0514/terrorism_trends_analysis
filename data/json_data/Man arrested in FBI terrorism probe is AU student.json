In an unsealed affidavit, the FBI said Qashou arrived in the U.S. through Atlanta's airport in 2015 and planned to study nursing at a community college in Opelika.\nQashou agreed to interviews at the FBI's Auburn field office and voluntarily shared his desire to join fighters in Syria, according to The Associated Press, but he also tried to minimize his support of \"radical Islamic ideology.\"\nQashou is the latest in a series of Alabama college students being tied to alleged terrorist threats.\nLast week, two University of South Alabama students were arrested on a charge of making a terrorist threat, and a former University of Alabama student pleaded guilty to concealment of terrorism financing after being charged by federal authorities a year ago.\nSign up for our newsletter\nGet The Plainsman straight to your inbox.\nAuburn's Tigermail e-mail system identifies Qashou as a junior in business administration.\n\nLoad-Date: September 20, 2019"
