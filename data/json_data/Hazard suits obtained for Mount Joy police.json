Each of the (borough's) four cruisers will have a bio-suit.\"\nHe said borough Officer Jose Ortiz will be the first from the department to undergo training with the new suit.\nO'Connell said once Ortiz is trained, he will train another officer. \"It is a train to trainer plan.\"\nO'Connell did not release details on the capabilities of the new suits or their cost.\nAccording to Web sites specializing in bio-suits, the gear worn by first responders during emergencies differs from basic model bio-suits in their ability to resist and filter various biological and chemical hazards during terrorist or other catastrophic incidents.\nThe suits were purchased by county officials for all police departments in Lancaster County through the regional task force, O'Connell said.\nThe South Central Pennsylvania Counter Terrorism Task Force was founded in 1997 to address the regional needs of local law enforcement agencies in Adams, Cumberland, Dauphin, Franklin, Lebanon, Perry, York and Lancaster counties related to terrorism issues.\nO'Connell also told council Detective Joseph Goody has 60 open cases, including nine new cases opened in January. Goody closed two cases in January and has 33 cold files.\nO'Connell said cases handled by Goody include felony assaults, criminal mischief incidents, fraud, thefts, homicides and sex cases.\n\"If an officer cannot follow up a case within two shifts, it is turned over to the detective who has more time to conduct interviews and further investigation,\" O'Connell said.\n\nLoad-Date: February 21, 2007"
