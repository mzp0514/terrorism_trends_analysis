    "full text": "Americans, on balance, think the C.I.A. was justified in its aggressive interrogation of terrorism suspects after the Sept. 11 attacks, according to three national polls conducted in the wake of the release last week of a report by the Senate Intelligence Committee.\nThe polls, conducted by CBS News,            the Pew Research Center and            ABC News/Washington Post, also found agreement among most Americans that the interrogation and detention techniques were successful in gaining information from terrorism suspects. The Senate report reached the opposite conclusion.\nDeep partisan divides were seen in all three polls on the issue of whether torture was justified, with strong majorities of Republicans and fewer than half of Democrats saying it was. The wording of the questions varied slightly between the polls, producing somewhat different results. The CBS News question, which referred to waterboarding, found fewer Americans saying the methods were justified. \nCBS News also asked about several of the specific interrogation methods that were detailed in the Senate report, including waterboarding, sleep deprivation and threats against family members.  Majorities of Americans across party lines agree that each is a form of torture. \nAll three polls were conducted Dec. 11-14 and have margins of sampling error ranging from plus or minus 3 to 4 percentage points. \n\nLoad-Date: December 16, 2014"
