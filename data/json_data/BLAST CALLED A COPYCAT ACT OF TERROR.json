    "full text": "PROVO -- Terrorist expert Carl Yeager's first reaction to the pipe bomb explosion in Atlanta's Centennial Park early Saturday was that it was a free-lance copycat act of terror.\nOrganized terrorist groups usually follow an act of terrorism with a political statement, he said.\nLikely groups that could have been responsible for the bombing include FALN, a Puerto Rican group. Pipe bombs are a FALN trademark, he said.\nIt could also have been an organized Shi'ite group. ''These people are opposed to international order and the Olympics bring people together,'' he said. ''Shi'tes build these types of bombs as much as anyone. A free-lancer can build pipe bombs. More and more gangs are getting into it. It's hard to understand their motivation.''\nPipe bombs are crude but effective up to about 50 feet and are deadly if enhanced with building staples or nails, Yeager said.\nDomestic counter-intelligence is handled by the FBI. But the end of the Cold War brought a reduction in military counter-intelligence in foreign lands, he said. Often the military would coordinate its efforts with the FBI but by law cannot do surveillance on domestic matters. ''The (terrorism) threat is not only there, it's increasing,'' he added. Americans are targets of both organized terrorism groups and free-lancers, he said.\nYeager was a member of the elite 9001st Military Intelligence Detachment (Anti-Terrorism) organization when it was eliminated about six years ago. The high-powered group gathered information on operations, tactics and belief systems of a variety of foreign terrorist organizations.\n\nLoad-Date: March 30, 1998"
