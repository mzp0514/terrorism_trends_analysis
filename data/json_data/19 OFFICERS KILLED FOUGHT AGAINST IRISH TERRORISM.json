    "full text": "A helicopter crash that killed 19 senior police and army officers was a blow to the fight against terrorism in Northern Ireland, a British official said today.\nSabotage was not suspected in the crash Thursday in heavy fog on the tip of the rugged Mull of Kintyre peninsula in western Scotland.\nThe Royal Air Force helicopter was carrying four crewmen and 25 officials from Northern Ireland to an army base near Inverness, Scotland, for a conference on terrorism.\nTen Northern Ireland police officers in the anti-terrorist Special Branch died, including Assistant Chief Constable Brian Fitzsimons, who oversaw the unit's network of spies and surveillance. Nine British army officers, six officials of the government's Northern Ireland Office and the crew also died.\nThe crash was \"a severe blow to our efforts to combat terrorism, but the operational effects will certainly be overcome,\" Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Cabinet member in charge of Northern Ireland, said at a news conference.\nMayhew refused to confirm reports that at least some of the six government officials who died were members of MI5, the domestic secret service, which runs agents in Northern Ireland. He called them civilian \"security specialists.\"\nThe dead officials oversaw British efforts to gather information about the Irish Republican Army and the Protestant extremist groups that oppose the IRA campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland.\nThe police and army operate separate intelligence networks of spies, informers, telephone taps and surveillance, but coordinate their efforts and share information - an evident aim of the meeting in Scotland.\nChief Constable Leslie Sharp of the Strathclyde police in Scotland said it was highly unlikely that sabotage played any role in the crash.\n\nLoad-Date: September 1, 1994"
