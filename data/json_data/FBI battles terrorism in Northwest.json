His group is a coalition of organizations\nin six Northwestern states countering white supremacist and extremist\ngroups.\nThe FBI task force is still being assembled. It will include agents\nfrom federal, state and local law enforcement agencies in eastern\nWashington, northern Idaho and western Montana, says Burdena Pasenelli,\nspecial agent in charge of FBI division headquarters in Seattle.\n\"Our goal is to find out ahead of time what is planned and to\nprevent incidents of domestic terrorism,\" she says. \"Historically,\nthis area has had a number of domestic terrorism incidents.\"\nThe task force is a joint effort of the FBI division headquartered\nin Seattle and Salt Lake City. It is an outgrowth of domestic\nterrorism legislation and the addition of 500 FBI agents authorized\nafter the 1995 bombing of the federal office building in Oklahoma\nCity.\nFormed at a meeting this fall in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, this is\nthe first FBI task force to cross state lines and FBI field offices,\nPasenelli says. \"We call it the Inland Empire,\" she says, referring\nto the three-state region being covered.\nRichard Butler, 80, is leader of a group called Aryan Nations,\nbased in Hayden Lake, Idaho, since 1973. He says the task force\nmay be watching his organization but his members are not involved\nin any terrorist activity.\n\"The FBI is just an arm of the money system,\" and is being directed\nby President Clinton, \"who has appointed nothing but non-Christians\nand nonwhites,\" Butler says.\nMark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala.,\nand editor of its quarterly Intelligence Report, says, \"The Pacific\nNorthwest has produced some of this nation's leading domestic\nterrorists.\" The only comparable areas are certain parts of the\nOzarks and rural North Carolina, he says.\nThe center has compiled a list of 26 domestic terrorist incidents\nbetween September 1995 and March 1998. Eight of those incidents\noccurred in the Northwest or were linked to organizations based\nthere.\nThe report notes that at the time of the Oklahoma City bombing,\nthe FBI had about 100 domestic terrorism investigations under\nway, compared with about 900 now.\n\nLoad-Date: December 23, 1998"
