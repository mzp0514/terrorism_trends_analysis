    "full text": "With the help of Afghan Taliban terrorists, the renegade Pakistan army has committed blatant aggression against India. The Pakistani lie - that it only gives diplomatic and moral support to Islamic terrorists - has been exposed by the American, British and German demands that it withdraw its forces from the Indian part of Kashmir.\nThe Western media now confirm that the weapons and equipment used by the aggressors come from Pakistan.\nThey also acknowledge the existence of hundreds of training camps in Pakistan where terrorism and murder is taught in the name of Islam.\nRecently, Israel destroyed bridges and power stations in Lebanon because terrorists from Lebanon killed two Israelis with rockets.\nNot too long ago, the U.S.-led alliance expelled Iraq from Kuwait militarily.  To punish its aggression and terrorism, Iraq was debilitated with long economic sanctions.\nThe Pakistan government has systematically and brazenly sponsored murder and terrorism in India for more than a decade without any retaliation.\nPakistan's prime minister has clearly said that such aggressions will happen again and again.\nThis is a classic case of diminishing responsibility.\nAfter silently suffering Pakistani terrorism and aggression for decades, India can now justifiably take military action for its long-term security.\nAs Pakistan seeks to blackmail the civilized world with its nuclear weapons, it forgets that its capability is not decisive. Unless Pakistan is taught a permanent lesson for its blatant aggression, it will continue to foster and spread terrorism year after year.\nThe fundamentalist Islamic-Pakistan-Taliban nexus poses severe threat even to the West and the entire humanity.\nThe world can help in this fight against terrorism by declaring Pakistan a rogue and terrorist state, and by imposing severe sanctions on it.\nMac Kher\nBloomington\n\nLoad-Date: July 7, 1999"
