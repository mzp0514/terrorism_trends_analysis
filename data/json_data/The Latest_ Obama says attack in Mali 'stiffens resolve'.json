Terrorism and disputes over the South China Sea are also on the agenda. (All times local):\n___\n11 a.m.\nPresident Barack Obama says the deadly assault on a hotel in Mali is yet another reminder that the \"scourge of terrorism\" threatens many nations.\nAnd he says the \"barbarity\" shown by Islamic extremists at the Radisson hotel in the capital of Bamako \"only stiffens our resolve to meet this challenge.\"\nThe assault on the hotel came exactly one week after attacks coordinated by the Islamic State group left 130 people dead across Paris.\nAt least 20 were killed in Mali, including at least one American.\nObama says the U.S. is working to account for Americans who may have been at the hotel. He also extended condolences to families of the victims, and thanked the security forces who responded.\nHe spoke in Malaysia during a regional summit.\n___\n9:50 a.m.\nMalaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has opened a two-day regional summit with a call to defeat Islamic terrorism, saying its barbaric attacks do not represent any race or religion.\nNajib was speaking Saturday at the summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a regional grouping of 10 nations that include the Muslim-majority nations of Malaysia and Indonesia. Indonesia, and the neighboring Philippines, which has a large Muslim minority, have been hit by Islamic extremism.\nNajib referred to those two countries, as well as the attacks in Paris and Friday's deadly hostage-taking in Bamako, Mali.\nNajib says Malaysia stands ready to provide any help and support it can.\nHe says: \"Be assured that we stand with you against this new evil that blasphemes against the name of Islam.\"\n___\n9:35 a.m.\nPrime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia has described Islamic State group as \"evil\" and a perverted form of Islam, as he and President Barack Obama pledged to fight Islamic extremism.\nAfter a meeting with Obama late Friday, Najib said his government is very clear that it is against the IS, \"its ideology, what it stands for.\"\nHe says \"it is evil. It is against Islam. It is a perverted Islam. And they do not represent us.\"\nNajib says Malaysia and the United States will work together and with other like-minded countries to make Southeast Asia safer.\nObama is in Malaysia to attend a regional summit that ends Sunday.\nIn his remarks, Obama said Malaysia, like Indonesia, is a majority-Muslim country that represents tolerance and peace. Obama said that as a consequence, \"its voice is critical in the debate that is taking place internationally around terrorism.\"\n___\n9 a.m.\nHeads of state from 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations have formally opened their weekend summit in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur.\nThe main event is the launch of a unified economic community that has been eight years in the making.\nOn Sunday, the leaders of Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei, Thailand and the Philippines, along with ASEAN's four less developed members, Communist Vietnam and Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia, will sign a declaration establishing the ASEAN Economic Community, originally envisioned in 2002.\nAlthough ASEAN has helped greatly increase the region's economic and political integration, there is a long way to go before the AEC becomes fully functional after becoming a legal entity on Dec. 31.\nASEAN countries have torn down tariff barriers and have removed some visa restrictions, but they fall short in more politically sensitive areas such as opening up agriculture, steel, auto production and other protected sectors.\n\nLoad-Date: November 21, 2015"
