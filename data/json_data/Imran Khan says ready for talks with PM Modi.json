There can't be a military solution for Kashmir,\" he said.\nHe, however, said the gesture for peace cannot be one-sided.\n\"We are willing to wait for (general) elections to get over in India for a gesture from New Delhi,\" Khan said.\nOn punishing Mumbai attack mastermind and Jamat-ud Dawah chief Hafiz Saeed, who is carrying a USD 10 million US bounty, said, \"there are UN sanctions against Hafiz Saeed. There is already a clampdown on him.\"\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MetroVaartha English.
