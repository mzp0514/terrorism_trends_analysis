Most of them were Canadians of Indian descent and many of the bodies would never be recovered.\nLess than an hour earlier, another bomb blast killed two baggage handlers at Tokyo's Narita airport. Luggage containing a stereo tuner hiding an explosive device was meant to be placed aboard Air India Flight 301.\nIt was the world's deadliest case of aviation terrorism until the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.\nAjaib Singh Bagri, a 53-year-old sawmill worker from Kamloops, British Columbia, and Ripudaman Singh Malik, a 56-year-old Vancouver millionaire, face multiple counts, including first-degree murder, attempted murder and conspiracy in the bombings.\n\nLoad-Date: April 29, 2003"
