    "full text": "SALEM, Utah - A Utah school apologized Thursday for a classroom assignment in which students were asked to create a propaganda poster for a group such as Islamic State to understand the goals and methods of terror groups.\nThe assignment at Salem Junior High School was canceled after several parents called to complain, Nebo School District spokeswoman Lana Hiskey said.\nHiskey said the assignment was given Wednesday by a first-year teacher to about 60 ninth-grade students in a world civics class. It was not approved by the school and was not a part of any official curriculum.\n\"She wanted the students to understand how propaganda can be wrong and lead people incorrectly,\" Hiskey said of the teacher.\nSchool officials were first alerted to the assignment when parents complained.\nNo disciplinary action was planned against the teacher, who is apologetic and has met with school administrators, said Hiskey, who declined to provide the educator's name.\nThe assignment came as students were discussing the Middle East, terrorism and propaganda, including the use of propaganda during World War II, Hiskey said.\nStudents were asked to mock up a \"neat, colored, professional\" poster, KUTV-TV (http://bit.ly/1I28sm5 ) reported.\nA worksheet said the poster could help students understand the goals of terrorist groups and the methods they use to gain support.\nIt also included a disclaimer saying any student uncomfortable with the assignment could ask for an alternative. Hiskey did not know if any students made that request.\nThe school is located in Salem, Utah, about 60 miles south of Salt Lake City.\n___\nInformation from: KUTV-TV, http://www.kutv.com/\n\nLoad-Date: November 19, 2015"
