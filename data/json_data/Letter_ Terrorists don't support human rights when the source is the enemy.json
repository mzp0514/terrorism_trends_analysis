    "full text": "Editor,\nFour Air Force veterans, who officially operated U.S. drones assassinating people in other countries, have spoken out. They wrote to President Obama, \"We came to the realization that the innocent civilians we were killing only fueled the feelings of hatred that ignited terrorism and groups like ISIS, while also serving as a fundamental recruitment tool similar to Guantanamo Bay. This administration and its predecessors have built a drone program that is one of the most devastating driving forces for terrorism and destabilization around the world.\"\nWhen the U.S. murders, by drones, thousands of women, men and children, when the U.S. wages war in Iraq and Afghanistan, when the U.S. supports Israel's atrocities against the Palestinians, many people in these countries reject women's rights, gay rights, freedom of speech...partly because they see those movements coming from the U.S. - the enemy nation killing their people.\nI strongly support women's rights, gay rights and freedom of speech worldwide! I damn ALL wars as crimes against humanity. Almost half of the U.S. federal income tax dollars pay for WAR! So I have paid NO federal income tax, not one penny, for U.S. wars for 37 years!\nDon Schrader\n\nLoad-Date: December 15, 2016"
