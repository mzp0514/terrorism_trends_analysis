    "full text": "The opinion-page column ''A Dialogue Held Hostage to Terrorism,'' June 14, is misleading in its defense of dialogue between the United States and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).\nIn its agreement with the PLO, the Bush administration required the PLO to denounce, distance itself from, and discipline the perpetrators of any act of terror.\nFailure to adhere to the terms would mean the termination of the dialogue.\nThe PLO's Palestine Liberation Front attempted to kill civilians on a Tel Aviv beach. Abul Abbas, the attack's architect is a member of Yasser Arafat's inner circle and the PLO's executive committee. Mr. Arafat must control Mr. Abbas for the sake of negotiations.\nIt is incorrect to blame the Israelis for the stalled peace process. Israel, after all, has already given Egypt two-thirds of the territories captured during the 1967 war for nothing more than the promise of peace.\nLet the Arab world end its holy war against Israel and the peace process will indeed be back on track.\nWilliam E. Rapfogel, New York, Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations\nLetters are welcome. Only a selection can be published, subject to condensation, and none acknowledged.
