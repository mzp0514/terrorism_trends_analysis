    "full text": "THE HIGH-STAKES Manhattan terrorism trial of Osama Bin Laden's son-in-law starts Monday.\nThe federal prosecution has major legal and political implications because Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, 48, is the highest-ranked Al Qaeda figure to face trial on U.S. soil since the 9/11 attacks, experts told the Daily News.\nThe Obama administration wants the trial to prove the strength of the civilian court system and to silence politicians on the right who clamored for a military trial, said Zachary Goldman, executive director at the NYU Center on Law and Security.\n\"This trial sends a message. We have slowly chipped away at the senior leadership of Al Qaeda over the last decade,\" he said.\n\"While there may be certain circumstances in which military commissions are necessary, this case will probably demonstrate the continued appropriateness of using the civilian court system to try terrorists,\" said Goldman, a former special assistant to the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman.\nThe transparency gained by holding the trial in Manhattan Federal Court off Foley Square, just blocks from Ground Zero, may increase the deterrent effect of a verdict, Goldman said.\n\"The public has more access, and so do people who are contemplating terrorism,\" he said. \"It must be demoralizing (for would-be terrorists) to see the son-in-law of Osama Bin Laden shackled and escorted into court every morning like some drug dealer.\"\nAbu Ghaith, 48, is charged with conspiring to kill Americans and providing support to terrorists while working as a spokesman for Al Qaeda around the time of the 9/11 attacks. He faces up to life in prison if convicted.\nProsecutors allege the bearded Kuwaiti native spent the months before 9/11 recruiting would-be terrorists to deadly Al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan.\nIn a video with Bin Laden made the day after 9/11, Abu Ghaith urged Muslims to do battle against \"the Jews, the Christians and Americans\" and in a speech he warned that \"the storms shall not stop, especially the airplane storm,\" prosecutors charge\nAbu Ghaith was captured last March in Jordan after spending more than a decade in Iran.\nHe has pleaded not guilty.\nThe entire world will be watching the trial, said Thomas McDonnell, a Pace University professor who specializes in terrorism law.\n\"This is a son-in-law of Osama Bin Laden, the greatest actor of terrorism in contemporary history,\" he said. \"There will be pressure to impose a heavy sentence.\"\nJudge Lewis Kaplan, who has tried several terrorism cases, sentenced Al Qaeda plotter Ahmed Ghailani to life in prison in 2011.\nAbu Ghaith has sought to obtain information from 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and Bin Laden's former driver may testify via video from the United Kingdom for the defense.\nSaajid Badat, a man who plotted with 2001 shoe bomber Richard Reid, will likely testify via video from Britain for the prosecution.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nSulaiman Abu Ghaith (left and far left, with Osama Bin Laden after the 9/11 attacks) goes on trial in Manhattan Federal Court on Monday. The White House wants the public proceeding to highlight progress made against Al Qaeda, experts say.\n\nLoad-Date: March 3, 2014"
