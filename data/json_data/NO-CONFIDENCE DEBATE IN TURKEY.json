    "full text": "Turkey's Parliament agreed today to consider a no-confidence motion against the Government in a move that stirred widespread anxiety over the future of Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel.\nIn an action that surprised many in Parliament, the Prime Minister's ruling Justice Party joined the opposition in voting to include the motion on the parliamentary agenda.\nAN-ADebate is to begin next week.\nThe vote came shortly after Mr. Demirel met with Secretary of State Edmund S. Muskie, who arrived here today for the NATO ministers' conference.\nMr. Muskie told a news conference that that Mr. Demirel had discussed the motion with him and that he ''gave the feeling that he has the votes.''\nThe opposition leader, former Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, introduced the motion last week against the policies of the Demirel Government, particularly its failure to control inflation and terrorism.\nPrime Minister Demirel appeared in Parliament this afternoon and accused Mr. Ecevit's Republican People's Party of seeking to overthrow his Government without producing a clear alternative.\n''If you don't trust our Government, then you should tell us to go,'' Mr. Demirel said, ''but you should also tell us how you plan to solve Turkey's problems.''"
