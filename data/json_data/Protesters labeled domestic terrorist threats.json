(David Carson/St. Louis Post-Dispatch/TNS)\nKate Irby, McClatchy Washington Bureau October 30, 2017Filed under Nation/WorldShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via Email Close Modal Window\nHang on for a minute...we're trying to find some more stories you might like.\nClose Close Modal WindowSend email to this address Enter Your Name Add a comment here Verification Send Email Cancel WASHINGTON -The FBI counterterrorism division's identification of a movement it calls \"black identity extremists\" is the latest addition to the list of protesters and dissidents the agency puts under the \"domestic terrorism\" umbrella.\nBut many national security experts say the designation doesn't describe a movement at all, let alone a terrorism threat. It's simply a label that allows the FBI to conduct additional surveillance on \"basically anyone who's black and politically active,\" said Michael German, who left the FBI in 2004 and did undercover domestic terrorism work.\nCritics are concerned that increasingly, it appears to be minorities and environmental protesters who are being targeted.\nWhile the practice of labeling certain protest groups as domestic terrorists is not unique to President Donald Trump's administration, Hina Shamsi, national security project director at the American Civil Liberties Union, said there's concern that \"abusive and unjustified investigations\" by the FBI are rising.\n\"We are worried that protesters are increasingly being labeled as terrorism threats,\" Shamsi said.\nIt's difficult to know for sure whether the Trump administration engages in the practice more often, however, because the FBI and other law enforcement entities rarely make that information available to the public. But rhetoric critical of certain groups by the Justice Department and the White House also tends to inform FBI decisions, German said, and empowers those seeking to target those groups.\nThe problem, Shamsi said, is partly in the overly broad definition of domestic terrorism in the Patriot Act as a violation of the criminal laws of a state or the United States that is \"dangerous to human life\" and appears to be intended to \"influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion.\"\nEighty-four members of Congress cited that intention to intimidate or coerce in a letter to the Justice Department this week that asked whether the department had labeled Dakota Access Pipeline protesters domestic terrorists. Calls and emails to multiple members of Congress who signed the letter were not returned.\nProtests of the pipeline's construction led to the arrest of 761 people, most of them on misdemeanor charges, according to the Morton County, N.D., Sheriff's Department. Some of the protesters accused of setting fire to campsites and turning off safety valves in efforts to shut down the pipeline were charged with more serious crimes.\n\"Damaging pipeline infrastructure poses multiple risks to humans and the environment. When an individual burns a hole through a pipeline currently in operation, there is a high probability this could ignite the contents, killing not only the perpetrator but other innocent victims,\" said the letter, written by Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo. \"It also has the potential to cause property and environmental damage, as well as disrupt services to communities and consumers.\"\nThe Justice Department did not respond to questions about the letter.\nDomestic terrorism is not a criminal charge, but if the label is applied to certain protesters it makes it much easier for law enforcement to conduct surveillance of those groups with minimum oversight. That surveillance can extend to the seizure of assets of both individuals and an involved organization without a prior hearing and many times without evidence, Shamsi said.\n\"This has absolutely been a pattern by federal, state and local law enforcement,\" Shamsi said. \"And it is absolutely subject to rhetorical and political manipulation, and there is a real danger that arises from that.\"\nThe FBI report that focused on black identity extremists, which was published in August and leaked to Foreign Policy in October, had interest groups questioning whether the designation has been used to target members of Black Lives Matter, though it never specifically mentions the group.\n\"The FBI defines black identity extremists as individuals who seek, wholly or in part, through unlawful acts of force or violence, in response to perceived racism and injustice in American society and some do so in furtherance of establishing a separate black homeland or autonomous black social institutions, communities or governing organizations within the United States,\" the leaked report says. The movement began after the Ferguson, Mo., protests in 2014, according to the document.\nThe report predicted it is \"very likely\" that black identity extremists would engage in \"ideologically motivated, violent criminal activity\" against police within a year.\nIt identified six attacks against police as examples of black identity extremism, but German, now a fellow at the liberal Brennan Center, said the logic in the report is deeply flawed.\n\"If you look at three of those cases, there's no ideology connecting them at all,\" German said. \"The only commonality is that they're black.\"\n\"They're taking isolated incidents and turning it into a movement to justify increased surveillance,\" he continued. \"It's throwing fuel on this argument of a war on police by black people, even though if you look at the numbers that's not the case.\"\nThere has been no significant change in the number of law enforcement deaths in recent years. So far in 2017, 107 police officers have been killed in the line of duty, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. In 2016, 135 officers died while on duty; the figure was 124 in 2015, 119 in 2014 and 177 in 2011. Viewed historically, the fluctuation is fairly typical, and the numbers are trending downward overall. The downward trend is also true for the subset of firearms-related deaths only.\nThe FBI declined to comment on the report specifically, but said in a statement that it \"cannot initiate an investigation based solely on an individual's race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, or the exercise of First Amendment rights.\"\n\"Our focus is not on membership in particular groups but on individuals who commit violence and other criminal acts,\" the statement said. \"Furthermore, the FBI does not and will not police ideology. When an individual takes violent action based on belief or ideology and breaks the law, the FBI will enforce the rule of law.\"\nThe Homeland Security Department has also likened certain protests over relations with law enforcement to domestic terrorism. In a February report leaked to the Intercept, the department said that \"anger over the results of the 2016 presidential election continues to be a driver of domestic terrorist violence throughout the United States - as evidenced by rioting in Portland, Oregon, following the election and destruction of property in Washington during the inauguration.\"\nThe Portland \"rioting\" mentioned was an anti-Trump protest with a focus on racism in the justice system. It started as a peaceful march of about 4,000 people, but \"anarchists\" in the crowd reportedly started throwing objects at officers and vandalizing businesses and cars. Police declared it a riot due to \"extensive criminal and dangerous behavior.\"\nThose riots were then cited as evidence by Homeland Security of \"domestic terrorist violence.\"\nGerman said that designation has practical effects at the local police level, as protests by groups such as Black Lives Matter are met by police with tear gas, rubber bullets, mace and other chemical agents. He referred to the September protests in St. Louis after the acquittal of police officer Jason Stockley in the fatal 2011 shooting of Anthony Lamar Smith, saying the policing of those protests was \"dangerous.\"\nThough the black identity extremist label seems unique to the Trump administration, the targeting of minority groups is not.\n\"There is no question that people who have been singled out include Muslims, black activists and environmental and animal rights activists, regardless of the administration,\" Shamsi said.\nIn 2004 and 2005, the FBI labeled environmental protesters the primary domestic terrorism threat, despite no deaths cause by environmentally motivated protesters at the time, German said.\nThere is no public list of what the FBI considers domestic terrorist groups, Shamsi said.\n\"If there were a list of domestic terrorist organizations, it would virtually guarantee an investigation into First Amendment violations,\" Shamsi said.\nThe ACLU has recommended limiting the definition of domestic terrorism to include only acts that \"cause serious injury or death\" rather than ones that are \"dangerous to human life,\" a more ambiguous term. But Shamsi said that's merely a first step in correcting an overreach into citizens' constitutional rights, one that can have a significant chilling effect on people who want to practice their right to speak out against their government.\n\nLoad-Date: October 30, 2017"
