    "full text": "BOSTON - With placards reading \"God Hates Renoir\" and \"Aesthetic Terrorism,\" a small band of protesters descended on the Museum of Fine Arts here this week. In their view, the long-dead French Impressionist Pierre-Auguste Renoir, who painted \"treacle\" and \"deformed pink fuzzy women,\" is overrated, overvalued and should not be taking up gallery space here or anywhere else.\nThe R.S.A.P. (\"Renoir Sucks At Painting\") movement said the event here would be the first of \"many anti-Renoir direct actions at museums.\" The goal of the self-proclaimed \"cultural justice seekers\" is for museums to take down their bad Renoirs and replace them with actual masterpieces; failure to do so, they say, amounts to \"aesthetic terrorism.\"\nThe instigator of the movement, Max Geller, a political organizer based in New York, created a following through an Instagram account that parodies and derides the Renoir oeuvre. \nAmong the comments is one from Genevieve Renoir, who says she is the painter's great-great-granddaughter and who took exception to the movement: \"When your great-great-grandfather paints anything worth $78.1m dollars (which is $143.9M in today's dollars), then you can criticize. In the meantime, it is safe to say that the free market has spoken and Renoir did NOT suck at painting.\"\n\nLoad-Date: October 7, 2015"
