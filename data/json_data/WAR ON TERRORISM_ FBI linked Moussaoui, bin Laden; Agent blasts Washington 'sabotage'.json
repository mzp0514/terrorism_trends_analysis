    "full text": "Washington --- Within days of arresting Zacarias Moussaoui last August for overstaying his visa, FBI agents in Minneapolis suspected that he was connected to Osama bin Laden, according to a letter written by the legal counsel in the agency's Minneapolis office.\nThe letter, written last week by Coleen Rowley, was obtained by Time magazine and posted on its Web site on Sunday.\nSome excerpts of the 13-page letter were revealed last week after it was delivered to FBI Director Robert S. Mueller and congressional intelligence committees. It was first reported in its entirety Sunday by Time magazine, which posted an edited copy on its Web site.\nCox Washington Bureau\nBased on intelligence from France, Rowley wrote, Minnesota FBI agents believed that probable cause existed to obtain a search warrant for Moussaoui. The probable cause was based on two possible criminal violations last August, before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks: conspiring to commit an act of terrorism and planning the destruction of \"aircraft or aircraft facilities,\" according to Rowley's letter.\nIn the letter Rowley asserts that a unit at FBI headquarters in Washington was aware of an intense investigation of Moussaoui but \"sabotaged\" the efforts of its Minneapolis office.\nMoussaoui, 33, a French citizen, is the sole person charged with conspiring with the 19 al-Qaida followers to attack Washington and New York on Sept. 11. He has been in custody since August 15 after he raised suspicions at a flight school in Minnesota. He had spent $8,000 in cash to learn how to fly a 747, even though he had limited basic training in how to fly a plane.\nIn her letter, Rowley accuses Mueller of making it appear that the FBI had no concrete evidence that Moussaoui was involved in planning the terrorist attacks until after the Sept. 11 strikes.\n\"To get to the point, I have deep concerns that a delicate and subtle shading/skewing of facts by you and others at the highest levels of FBI management has occurred and is occurring,\" said Rowley, who said it would be too strong to use the term \"cover-up.\"\nShe also questions the wisdom of plans to consolidate the bureau's anti-terrorism efforts in Washington, given the way headquarters allegedly interfered with the Minnesota investigation of Moussaoui.\n\"Your plans for an FBI headquarters 'super squad' simply fly in the face of an honest appraisal of the FBI's pre-Sept. 11th failures,\" Rowley wrote. French intelligence agents, as well as FBI field agents in Minneapolis and Phoenix, exhibited \"keen perception\" in ferreting out potential terrorists. \"The same cannot be said for FBI headquarters' bureaucracy,\" she wrote.\nRep. Porter Goss (R-Fla.), chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said Sunday that he doubts the FBI is capable of heading off terrorist activities within the United States.\n\"I just think they've got to go through a big learning curve, a lot of readjustment,\" Goss said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\nGoss' committee is joining with its Senate counterpart to investigate what the government knew and did to fight terrorism before the Sept. 11 attacks.\nGoss said that if the letter is accurate, \"that people were reluctant --- there was a culture in Washington that said, 'No, we don't want to rock the boat. We want to --- we're too worried about profiling, those kind of things.' We've got to know about that and figure out as a society how we are going to react.\"\nAsked if he meant one reason the FBI may have rejected a warrant request was concern about racial profiling, Goss replied: \"I don't know the answer to that. But I'm surely going to ask the question, because it has been suggested.\"\nThough strident and critical in her letter, Rowley also tells Mueller that \"from the 5th grade, when I first wrote the FBI and received the '100 Facts about the FBI' pamphlet, this job has been my dream.\"\nMueller has referred the allegations in Rowley's letter to the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General. Since Rowley is seeking federal whistle-blower status, the FBI is not permitted to discuss the case.\nPrior to Rowley's letter surfacing on Capitol Hill, Mueller had publicly stated that the bureau turned down a request to search Moussaoui's computer shortly after his arrest because there was insufficient evidence.\nAs one FBI official put it at the time, \"you can't arrest someone for their religion.\" Other than overstaying his visa violation, Moussaoui had not committed a crime.\nRowley singles out a supervisor at FBI headquarters for ignoring the evidence gathered by the Minneapolis agents and French intelligence. She asserts that the supervisor was allowed to \"downplay the significance of the information.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPhoto:\nMinneapolis FBI agent Coleen Rowley criticizes FBI headquarters' handling of the Moussaoui evidence and says plans for a \"super squad\" to combat terrorism are a bad idea.
