FBI leaders have described the agency's lack of diversity as a crisis and Minneapolis' field office has hovered around 80 percent white and male in recent years.\nSanborn spoke to reporters Friday in a roundtable-style briefing. She is about eight weeks into the job, which also includes leading the FBI in the Dakotas. She said she has so far met with agents at resident agencies in Indian Country and South Dakota, and will soon make her first trip to North Dakota.\nBefore coming to Minneapolis, Sanborn spent most of her 20-year career investigating terrorism - including the 2015 San Bernardino, Calif., attack - and identified international terrorism as the top threat facing jurisdictions nationwide. She has met twice with leaders from the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force in Minneapolis. Sanborn said, \"There is nothing telling me I have a specific problem here in Minnesota and the Dakotas.\"\nHowever, Sanborn said, she is concerned about \"homegrown violent extremists\" who may be inspired by peers or propaganda online and may be difficult to detect before they carry out an attack.\nSanborn said the FBI is in the process of preparing a yearly threat assessment that will determine to what extent other forms of extremism, such as the anti-government militia that allegedly traveled from Illinois to Minnesota to bomb a Bloomington mosque, are present in Minnesota.\nStephen Montemayor Â· 612-673-1755 Twitter: @smontemayor\n\nLoad-Date: June 19, 2018"
