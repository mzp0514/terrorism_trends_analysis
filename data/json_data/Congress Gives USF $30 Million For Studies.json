Because of that, less was left for Florida's universities, despite the state's lobbying efforts.\nOfficials said they were still pleased with the money they got. \"This was a very tough year for Congress,\" USF President Judy Genshaft said.\nIt wasn't known Wednesday how much USF received in congressional funding last year for special research projects. This year, the $30 million the university received pays for projects such as biomedical engineering and robotics research. USF will lead an $8.5 million state university research effort to fight biological and chemical terrorism.\nStatewide, the research money pays for projects including citrus canker research and fighting terrorism.\nReporter Adam Emerson can be reached at (813) 259-8285.\nCopyright Â© 2006, The Tampa Tribune and may not be republished without permission.
