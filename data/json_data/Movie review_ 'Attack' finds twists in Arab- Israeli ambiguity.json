    "full text": "The ambiguity of the Israeli/Palestinian thriller \"The Attack\" is maddening, yet understandable considering the difficult nature of the conflict it covers.\nAmin Jaafari (played by Ali Suliman) is a Palestine-born surgeon living a prosperous life in Tel Aviv. That all changes when a suicide bomber hits a nearby restaurant, killing 17 people, including 11 kids. Soon the cops are at Amin's door, saying that his wife, Siham (Reymond Ansalem), was the bomber.\nAfter first denying that she was capable of such violence, Amin travels to the Palestinian town of Nablus to find out how she could have been swayed into committing an act of terrorism.\nDirector Ziad Doueiri sends Amin diving into the heart of the Israeli occupation, explaining Palestinian rage and the impetus for such attacks as few movies ever have. Whether you think the movie is making excuses for suicide bombers is just one more question this haunting drama leaves unanswered.\nwww.sltrib.com/entertainment\n  Alt Heads:\n'Attack' finds twists in Arab-Israeli ambiguity HHH\n'The Attack'\nOpens Friday, July 5, at the Broadway Centre Cinemas; R for some violent images, language and brief sexuality; in Arabic and Hebrew with subtitles; 102 minutes.\nHHH\n'The Attack'\nOpens today at the Broadway Centre Cinemas; R for some violent images, language and brief sexuality; in Arabic and Hebrew with subtitles; 102 minutes.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nAmin (Ali Suliman), a Palestinian doctor living in Tel Aviv, tries to uncover the mystery of his wife Siham (Reymonde Ansellem, shown in the poster) turned to terrorism, in the drama \"The Attack.\"\n\nLoad-Date: July 7, 2013"
