    "full text": "A letter opposing wind farms used hyperbolic statements, questionable statistics and asked what taxpayers are getting for stimulus and tax money spend on clean energy. The letter's authors said the answer was nothing.  \nThat conclusion seems incorrect, unless you like $4 gasoline, love air and water pollution, and don't mind funding terrorism by importing Middle East oil. The Obama administration's \"all of the above\" energy policy has increased domestic oil and natural gas production, and promoted conservation and wind, solar and battery technologies resulting in cleaner air and water, lower energy prices, many energy sector jobs and a foreign policy less dominated by the need to import oil from countries that support terrorism.  \nThe authors of the letter also decried wind farms, saying they destroy the beauty of the countryside and questioned effects on agriculture. But when compared to areas with oil fields, coal mines and oil refineries, or where oil spills, acid rain or air and water pollution have caused serious environmental damage, impacts of wind farms seem minimal. \nWhen I see wind turbine blades spinning in the breeze surrounded by fields of corn and soybeans, I know the energy produced doesn't add to climate change, pollute the environment or require U.S. soldiers to be killed or wounded to keep oil flowing and deal with terrorism, and that's beautiful. \nWind and other clean energy technologies aren't scams. Real scams include the massive Wall Street fraud and the Iraq War that occurred during the Bush administration. \nLinda L. Doenitz \nBloomington \n\nLoad-Date: April 23, 2015"
