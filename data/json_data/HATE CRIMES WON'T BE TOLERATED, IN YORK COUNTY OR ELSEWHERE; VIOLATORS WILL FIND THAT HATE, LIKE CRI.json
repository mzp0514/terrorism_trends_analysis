    "full text": "Cumberland County Sheriff Mark Dion once decribed hate crimes as \"community terrorism.\" They are crimes committed against people because of their race, gender, religion, ethnicity or sexual orientation.\nFrederick White, 18, of Acton made his mistake when he allegedly deviated from what was apparently his normal bullying and terrorizing routine to harrass and threaten two youths \"by characteristic.\" The youths are gay. White reportedly told one of the boys he wanted to see the boy die, and once choked him aboard the school bus. He allegedly told one of the boy's friends, a 15-year-old girl, that he would kill her. A hate crimes complaint says White also threatened a boy who was active in a local Baptist church.\nIt is for good reason, then, that the Maine Attorney General's Office filed the complaint against the former Wells High School student in York County Superior Court this week. The complaint asks that White be required to stay 250 feet away from his alleged victims, their homes and the high school, not own a firearm, and pay a $ 5,000 fine for each violation.\nWells Police are pursuing their own criminal charges.\n\"Community terrorism\" won't be tolerated, state and York authorities are saying -- whether it's in York County or anywhere else in Maine.\n\nLoad-Date: May 15, 1999"
