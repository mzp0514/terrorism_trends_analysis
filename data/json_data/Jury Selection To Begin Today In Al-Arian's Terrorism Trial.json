Defense attorneys have requested a change of venue because of intensive media coverage in the area; they argue it may have tainted a jury pool.\nMoody plans to bring in 50 prospective jurors each day beginning today. About 150 people are being considered to hear the trial.\nAlso today, Moody is expected to consider a motion filed by several media outlets seeking permission to report basic information about potential jurors. Moody issued an order barring photographs, sketches and verbal descriptions of jurors.\nReporter Josh Poltilove can be reached at (813) 835-2105.\nCopyright © 2005, The Tampa Tribune and may not be republished without permission.
