The\nbombing was not a strike at a military target but a cold-blooded\nkilling of innocent civilians. Arabs may argue that Israeli troops\nin the occupied territories - and last week in Lebanon - continue\nto kill Arab civilians; but this does not excuse such tactics.\nIsrael has cracked down on Hamas, closing Gaza and the West\nBank, and bombing southern Lebanon, where it says the terror was\nplanned. Yet this reaction is not a real answer. As Israelis and\nthe world get over the shock of these acts, there must be a broader\nconsideration of why they occurred, and what can be done about\nthem, if peace with justice is to emerge.\nHamas violence, inexcusable as it is, is not a surprising result\nof the deal Yasser Arafat, chairman of the PLO, signed with Israel\non Sept. 13, 1993. For Hamas and many others, the treaty that led\nto three Nobel prizes is an unjust surrender of the Palestinian\nclaim for a state. They feel Mr. Arafat was tricked.\nActually, they have a point. When Arafat met Israeli Prime\nMinister Yitzhak Rabin on the White House lawn, the world assumed\nhe knew what he was doing. Peace was at hand.\nYet as the Declaration of Principles (DOP) he signed was\nnegotiated, it became clear that Arafat had traded 45 years of\nPalestinian aspirations to statehood for administration of a tribal\nreservation in Israel. He has no authority, no Jerusalem, no state.\nJoel Singer, legal adviser to Mr. Rabin, says, ''The provisions of\nthe DOP ensure that Israel, through its military government, shall\ncontinue to be the source of authority'' in the territories,\nincluding Gaza and Jericho.\nHamas now represents the only organized resistance to apartheid\nconditions that continue in the territories. Arafat's only power is\nto police Gaza, and Palestinians see him arresting his people - the\njob Israelis used to do. A crackdown and closing of borders by\nIsrael will feed Hamas's popularity. Is this what Israel wants?\nIsraelis deserve to be secure. This can't be overstated. Yet\nsecurity can't be bought at the cost of the rights of the\nPalestinian people.\nIt is in Israel's interest to rethink the DOP and reinterpret it\n- allowing Arafat more room to develop a constituency, hold\nelections, develop civil authority, and achieve a state. The\nIsraeli writer Simha Flapan noted in the 1970s, ''In the long run,\nthe eradication of terrorism is possible only by eliminating the\ncondition that breeds it. Palestinian terrorism is a result of\nstatelessness and a refugee existence. Only a political solution\nthat offers the prospect of statehood, of a normal economy and a\nproductive life'' will end it.\nAmen.\n\nLoad-Date: October 25, 1994"
