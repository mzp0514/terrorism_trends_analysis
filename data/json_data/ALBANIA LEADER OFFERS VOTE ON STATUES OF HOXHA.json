Reuters PHILIPPINES 20,000 Rally, Call For Aquino To Quit World More than 20,000 protesters in Manila demanded Wednesday that President Corazon Aquino resign. The rally was a rare one, bringing together leftists, rightists and ex-supporters of the Philippine leader.  Speakers charged that Aquino has betrayed the ''people power revolution'' that swept her to power on Feb. 25, 1986. It was the largest anti-government rally in years and brought together former officials in Aquino's administration, leftists and rightist supporters of the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos.  About 200 riot police prevented the protesters from marching to military camps where hundreds of thousands of Filipinos staged the February 1986 uprising that toppled Marcos and propelled Aquino to power.

AP NEW YORK Company To Admit Mislabeling Of Drugs Nation A pharmaceutical company said Wednesday that it would plead guilty to selling adulterated and mislabeled generic medicine for high blood pressure.  Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. of New York said it also would admit to obstructing an inquiry by the Food and Drug Administration and lying to investigators.  The U.S. attorney in Baltimore claims Bolar substituted brand-name drugs for its own during testing of its hypertension drug, Triamterene-Hydrochlorothiazide. Between approval by the FDA in August 1987 and its withdrawal in January 1990, $140 million of the drug was sold, prosecutors said Tuesday.  The company said it would plead guilty to all 20 charges filed Tuesday and pay $10 million in fines, the maximum penalty it faced, and $250,000 in other costs. The charges are the latest in a continuing inquiryof the generic drug industry.  AP COST OF WAR $77.6 Million Sought For Terrorism Efforts Nation The White House is asking Congress for an extra $77.6 million to pay for anti-terrorism efforts related to the gulf war.  The FBI, which has been on a heightened state of alert against terrorists since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, wants $4.6 million to cover such costs as an increase in overtime for agents.  The Immigration and Naturalization Service is asking for $3.1 million for an increase in anti-terrorist alerts at land, sea and air ports of entry.  The largest single agency request - $39.7 million from the State Department - would pay for ''salaries and expenses'' incurred in protecting U.S.  officials and buildings inside and outside the United States.
