    "full text": "Tony Bennetthas apologized on his Facebook page for remarks he made on Howard Stern's radio show suggesting that the United States had caused the Sept. 11 attacks.\nIn an interview broadcast on Monday, Mr. Bennett, the 85-year-old pop crooner, was talking with Mr. Stern and his co-host, Robin Quivers, about war and terrorism when he said: ''But who are the terrorists? Are we the terrorists, or are they the terrorists? Two wrongs don't make a right.''\nWhen Mr. Stern said terrorists had ''started it'' by flying planes into the World Trade Center, Mr. Bennett answered, ''I don't know about that.''\nMr. Bennett added: ''They flew the plane in, but we caused it. Because we were bombing them, and they told us to stop. They said what are you doing? And they came on stronger. And come on -- we're going to have to retaliate. No, no, no. They said give them four times as much.''\nMr. Bennett also said in the radio interview that President George W. Bush had told him that the Iraq war had been a mistake.\nHis remarks about the attacks drew wide condemnation from listeners, and an editorial published Wednesday in The Daily News of New York called Mr. Bennett a ''knucklehead'' (even though that newspaper said he was ''one of our favorite singers and has been an all-around great representative of the Greatest Generation.'')\nMr. Bennett clarified his remarks in a statement posted on his Facebook page.\n''I am so grateful to be an American, and as a World War II veteran,'' he wrote, ''I was proud to fight to protect our values, which have made America the greatest country on the planet.''\nThe statement continued:\nThere is simply no excuse for terrorism and the murder of the nearly 3,000 innocent victims of the 9/11 attacks on our country.\nMy life experiences -- ranging from the Battle of the Bulge to marching with Martin Luther King -- made me a lifelong humanist and pacifist, and reinforced my belief that violence begets violence and that war is the lowest form of human behavior.\nI am sorry if my statements suggested anything other than an expression of my love for my country, my hope for humanity and my desire for peace throughout the world.\nThis is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO                             \n\nLoad-Date: September 22, 2011"
