    "full text": "NEW YORK - Three days of \"very intensive\" investigations failed to\nestablish a direct link between two men accused of plotting a suicide\nbombing on the subway and terrorist activities in Israel, a top\nofficial said.\nThe FBI, New York police and international intelligence agencies are\nworking to determine any connections between the suspects and Middle\nEastern militants, Sandy Berger, President Clinton's national security\nadviser, said Sunday on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\nGazi Ibrahim Abu Mezer, 23, and Lafi Khalil, 22, were captured\nThursday during an early-morning police raid on their Brooklyn\napartment. Authorities said they were hours away from attempting a\nsuicide bombing at a busy Brooklyn subway station.\nThe raid came the day after bombs killed 15 people in Jerusalem's main\nproduce market. Palestinian militants had threatened to carry out more\nattacks unless Israel released Islamic activists from prison.\nBerger said investigators so far \"have not established any direct\nrelationship\" between the Brooklyn plot and any wider conspiracy.\nThe Mideast terror group Hamas claimed responsibility for the\nJerusalem bombings, but on Saturday denied \"any relationship between\nus and those who were detained\" in Brooklyn.\nA day earlier, a federal law enforcement source in Washington told the\nAP that both suspects were linked to Hamas. But James Kallstrom, chief\nof the New York FBI office, said it \"is totally wrong to say that\nthese individuals are connected to and directed by Hamas.\"\n\nLoad-Date: August 5, 1997"
