Carl E. Brock, 28, of Claremore, Okla., died at his residence on post, according to a press release. He was a communications transmission systems operator with the 2nd Brigade Special Troops Battalion, 2nd Brigade Combat Team of the 10th Mountain Division.\nPost spokeswoman Julie A. Cupernall could not confirm Wednesday whether Sgt. Brock was scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan with the brigade early next year.\nHe died in a residence that is part of Fort Drum Mountain Community Homes.\nFort Drum said there should be no assumptions that because the CID is investigating, foul play may be involved.\nMs. Cupernall said she could say definitively there was no connection between Sgt. Brock's death and the Dec. 10 death of a 4-year-old boy from the post.\nSgt. Brock entered the Army in August 2007 and served overseas duty in Germany, Korea and Iraq before arriving at Fort Drum in November 2011. His awards include five Army Achievement Medals, the National Defense Service Medal, the Iraq Campaign Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and the Korean Defense Service Medal and others.\n___ (c)2012 Watertown Daily Times (Watertown, N.Y.)
