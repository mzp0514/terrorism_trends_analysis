    "full text": "The best terrorist weapon isn't a bomb, a missile or a gun. To succeed, terrorism must create fear, because fear makes people give up their rights to freedom and privacy.\nFear makes victims of many more people than a bomb ever could.\nWhen Americans start to give up their civil liberties in order to feel safe, the terrorists are gaining.\nA new device that X-rays through clothing - called the Passive Millimeter Wave Imager - crosses the line between taking precautions and giving up privacy, an important civil right.\nThe Constitution protects Americans against illegal searches and seizures, yet this device and the phi- losophy behind it would give police agencies the ability to conduct such searches without the subject's knowledge - the worst kind of invasion of privacy.\nUnforunately, surveys have shown that people are willing to give up some freedoms in order to feel safe and curb terrorism, but there are no assurances that such tactics as the use of surreptitious X-ray guns would do either.\nApproving use of such devices would demonstrate more panic than good sense. The Clinton administration has proposed increased wiretapping and other anti-terrorist measures including research for technology that was once intended only for military use, but fortunately Congress has not gone along.\nBetter and more thorough searches - conducted in traditional ways - would do more to thwart terrorist attacks than the use of intrusive devices that are illegal now for good reason.\nThe goal of terrorism is to influence thinking and behavior and ultimately to control both. Abandoning civil liberties and the laws that protect such freedoms only helps terrorists move closer to their goals.\n\nLoad-Date: March 30, 1998"
