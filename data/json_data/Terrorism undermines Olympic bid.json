    "full text": "A week before the 2004 Summer Olympics site is chosen, Stockholm's hopes of winning are overshadowed by threats that terrorists will strike again.\nA shadowy extremist group opposed to Stockholm's bid claimed responsibility for Monday's bombing of Sweden's largest stadium, the New Ullevi in Goteborg.\nThe claim was made in a letter sent from Sweden and received by The Associated Press in London on Wednesday.\nThe letter, like a previous one, complained that holding the Olympics in Sweden would be a misuse of taxpayers' money.\n\"We are well organized and determined. Ask the people of Stockholm if they are willing to see their fair city turned into a war zone. After the 5th of September, no arena in the Stockholm area will be safe,\" the letter said. It was written in English.\nA similar letter last week said the group was behind the Aug. 8 bombing of Stockholm's Olympic Stadium. Both stadiums are included in Stockholm's proposal for the 2004 games.\nThe International Olympic Committee will decide Sept. 5 which of five cities will get the games. Other cities competing are Rome, Athens, Greece, Buenos Aires and Cape Town, South Africa.\nStockholm's proposal has been widely praised for being well-designed and environmentally conscious. But observers have said that low public support for the bid is likely to be its fatal flaw - and the growing list of attacks and threats put it in more jeopardy.\nAn exasperated national police chief, Sten Heckscher, had to admit to reporters Wednesday that a laboratory machine needed to test the substance in the Stockholm bombing was broken. The substance had to be shipped to Scotland Yard in London for testing.\n\nLoad-Date: August 28, 1997"
