    "full text": "The fight against terrorism is the same, whether it is the U.S. responding to acts of death and destruction, or Israel. There are those who look upon Israel's responses as something much different than our response against those responsible for the destruction of the World Trade Center.\nThere is no difference.\nThe attacks upon the Israelis, almost without exception are against innocent civilians, whether the people are gathered for a wedding, at a sidewalk cafe, in a bus or other functions and places where people are gathered.\nIf we look objectively at what has happened, the Israeli responses have been very measured and calculated, targeted against the leader or leaders, the headquarters or the hiding places of those terrorist organizations such as the Hamas who are dedicated to the destruction of the Israelis and their country. By carefully and objectively looking at the situation the Israelis are in, and their measured responses, they essentially mirror the response of the United States to the terrorist acts against us.\nBefore we feel too sorry for the Palestinians, we must remember that it is their leader, the PLO and all the terrorist groups that the PLO has spawned who have never accepted the nation of Israel. These people have never abandoned their stated objective of the destruction of Israel. We must also remember that it was the United Nations that established the nation of Israel.\nDonald Larson\nLayton\n\nLoad-Date: February 7, 2002"
