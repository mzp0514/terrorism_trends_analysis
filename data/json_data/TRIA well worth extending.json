    "full text": "THE ADAGE ''haste makes waste'' may apply to many situations, but the reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act isn't one of them.\nAs we report on page 3, there's a growing consensus in the House of Representatives that TRIA should be extended, and extended soon. We couldn't agree more that some sort of guaranteed federal terrorism insurance backstop should be put in place, and put in place soon. Right now, a simple extension of TRIA, probably for two years, looks like the best way to do so.\nAfter all, the unified October 2001 insurance industry proposal for a federal terrorism insurance backstop envisioned a program lasting at least six years to allow underwriters to build up the expertise and capacity needed to craft a private terrorism insurance market. After a year of debate, Congress agreed to a three-year program. Many risk managers expressed concern during the debate that three years might not be enough time.\nSuch concerns were justified. While TRIA succeeded in its first goal of ensuring that terrorism coverage would be available, it has yet to realize its second goal of creating a vibrant private market for terrorism coverage.\nIt may well be that a totally private market will never come into being. The risk of an attack may be impossible to calculate and the values at risk too large for the private sector to handle on its own. While we would prefer a private-market solution, we realize it may not be achievable in the foreseeable future.\nCongress should allow more time to see if a private insurance response to the terrorism threat is possible. In the meantime, risk managers need the assurance that coverage for future terrorist acts will be available. The best way to provide that assurance is to reauthorize TRIA and reauthorize it soon.\n\nLoad-Date: May 5, 2004"
