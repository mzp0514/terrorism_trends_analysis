    "full text": "President Reagan insists on ''con-sistency'' in human rights policy. And Secretary Haig insists that the first target of such policy should be terrorism.\nEditorial says by lifting punitive measures against the Pinochet regime in Chile, the US has undercut principles of consistency in human rightsBut by lifting punitive measures against the Pinochet regime in Chile, the new Administration has managed in a stroke to undercut both principles.\nIn 1976, a prominent Chilean exile was the victim of a terrorist conspiracy on the streets of Washington. Orlando Letelier was killed when his car was blown apart, and so was his American associate, Ronnie Moffitt. An F.B.I. investigation established that President Pinochet's security forces were implicated in the murders. And the State Department duly asked Chile to extradite three officers suspected of direct complicity.\nChile refused. So in 1979 the Carter Administration retaliated by cutting off Chile's access to financing by the Export-Import Bank.  It was the minimum gesture consistent with American self-respect.\nThe Reagan team has now lifted that ban, and says it is inviting the Chilean Navy to take part in a joint exercise with United States warships. It surely does not thus intend to suggest that friendly dictatorships can get away with terrorism even in Washington. But it does suggest that the vaunted consistency is in the eye of the beholder."
