    "full text": "WASHINGTON (REUTERS) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Arab-Israeli peace talks have come to a halt because of ''terrorism'' that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat could stop.\n''I think we have had here a virtual collapse of the peace process,'' Netanyahu said on CBS television's ''Face the Nation'' program.\n''What we have found here, though, is that the Palestinian side has unleashed terrorism as a weapon of negotiation. We want to see the peace process continue without the threat of terrorism.''\nAsked if he felt Arafat was in control, Netanyahu replied: ''I think he is able to control and quell all violence.\n''We are not sure at this point that all the terrorists have been curbed. They should . . . make sure that they cannot act.''\nNetanyahu said he doubted Arab nations would cut ties to Israel because of continuing street battles between Israeli soldiers and Palestinians demonstrating against Israel's decision to start building new homes for Jews in historically Arab East Jerusalem.\n''I would urge the Arab countries to think of their larger interests, their longer interests, as I urge the Palestinians for the necessity of peace,'' he said. ''I don't think they would do it, and if they did it would cost them as much as it costs us.''\n\nLoad-Date: April 3, 1998"
