    "full text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has impressed many Americans during his first visit to the United States. Not everyone does or should agree with everything he has said, but he has not avoided addressing tough issues and has shown no signs of wavering from his position against terrorism.\nNetanyahu has declared he wants peace, but he has couched a promise to work for peace in the Middle East on the condition that terrorism first be stopped.\nUnfortunately, that's not likely to happen soon. Peace efforts should not be halted while action is taken to stop terrorists. Work in both areas can continue at once.\nIn addressing a joint session of Congress Wednesday, Netanyahu said Syria and the Palestinians have the power to stop terrorist attacks on Israelis and that they must do so before peace can be achieved.\nHis commitment to ending terrorism must be applauded, but with some reservation. In refusing to meet with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat or to pursue the ''land for peace'' concept that has guided Middle East peace negotiations, Netanyahu has closed some doors that might have been better left ajar.\nIn promising no redivision of Jerusalem, Netanyahu deserved the applause he received from members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. His commitment to creating a free market for ''goods and ideas'' bodes well for economic and business ties with U.S. capitalists.\nNetanyahu's rhetoric appears to represent a change in diplomatic style. His hard-line attitude toward negotiating peace only after terrorism is controlled could mean delays in peace talks that could undermine the relative progress made by his predecessor.\nEveryone involved in peace efforts - the Israelis, Palestinians, Syrians and Americans - will have to make adjustments to a new Israeli regime. We can only hope those adjustments don't hinder the long-term peace process.\n\nLoad-Date: March 30, 1998"
