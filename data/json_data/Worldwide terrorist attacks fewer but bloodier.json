That's 18 percent more than the average number of casualties inflicted per year by terrorists during the previous five years.\nFigures for 1993 - 1,510 terrorism casualties - were boosted by the World Trading Center bombing that killed six and injured roughly 1,000.\nThe statistics suggest that terrorists are killing and hurting more people per act than before. One reason: Terrorists are increasingly preying upon civilians in low-security, non-government facilities that offer little protection from terrorist acts.\nThe prospect of a terrorist attack with a sophisticated weapon of mass destruction remains, Wilcox said.\n\"We are deeply concerned about the prospect of terrorists getting hold of nuclear, biological or chemical substances and using them for terrorist purposes.\"\nWhile the Soviet Union's collapse has meant many Cold War terrorist groups have lost their patron and refuge, it has also raised new worries over the security of thousands of nuclear weapons scattered across the former Soviet empire.\nThose concerns have meshed with the quest by such nations as Iran for its own weapons of mass destruction and its continuing support for international terrorism.\n\"Iran is still the leading sponsor, state sponsor, of terrorism,\" Wilcox said. \"It continues to assassinate dissidents abroad. It maintains direct support for the Hezbollah, which is one of the most dangerous and lethal terrorist organizations. â€¦ And it is using its resources, money, materiel, to support those groups which are using terrorism against the (Middle East) peace process.\"\n\nLoad-Date: May 17, 1995"
