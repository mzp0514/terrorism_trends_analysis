    "full text": "Superlatives come too easy when it comes to U.S. diplomacy. The world is so complex, and U.S. interests so far-reaching, a president and his team have a dizzying number of ''critical'' relationships to manage at any one time.\nBut the relationship between the United States and Pakistan ought to rank high on any diplomatic task list, and the resignation Monday of that country's leader only adds to the urgency.\nPervez Musharraf's departure has been expected for weeks, but now that it's here, it raises a difficult challenge for the United States.\nThere are many reasons why Musharraf's rule wore thin in Pakistan. He has not embraced democracy, to say the least. He has been heavy-handed in attempts to cling to power, including replacing judges that he feared would not rule in his favor. But Musharraf leaves amid considerable resentment that he sided with the United States in the war on global Islamic terrorism, and drew fire especially for his willingness to use Pakistani troops to combat militants.\nSo the considerable diplomatic task awaiting President Bush and his successor is to convince the Pakistani government to cooperate in the war on terrorism, even when such cooperation carries with it some domestic political risk for Pakistan's rulers.\nThis is a delicate task. It requires an emphasis on short-term benefits associated with cooperation such as direct aid, but also a hint of the long-term negative consequences associated with providing tacit support for the Taliban and other radical groups.\nOn the stump, both Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain appear to recognize the importance of this relationship, though finding the right balance between tough rhetoric and diplomatic tones will be a challenge, both in terms of politics and eventual policy.\n\nLoad-Date: August 19, 2008"
