    "full text": "LONDON - Three British Muslims - including a convert who was featured in a documentary about radical Islam and a former London police support officer - have been charged with traveling to Pakistan for terror training, police said early today.\nScotland Yard said in a statement that Richard Dart, 29, Imran Mahmood, 21, and Jahangir Alom, 26, had traveled to Pakistan between 2010 and 2012 \"with the intention of committing acts of terrorism or assisting another to commit such acts.\"\nThe statement also alleges that the three provided others with advice and counseling about how to travel to Pakistan, find training, and how to stay safe while there.\nDart was featured in a recent BBC documentary, \"My Brother the Islamist,\" which chronicled the efforts of his filmmaker stepbrother, Robb Leech, to understand why the former had rejected his family and embraced an uncompromising form of Islam.\nAlom - who was arrested in an armed raid at his home only a mile from London's Olympic Stadium - was identified by Scotland Yard as a former police support officer. Police said, however, that the case is not Olympics-related.\nBoth men have appeared in YouTube videos in which they expound on their hardline beliefs.\nPolice did not immediately release much information on Mahmood. His address was given as down the street from London's Royal Air Force base Northolt, where Typhoon jets and other military elements are due to provide security for the 2012 Games, which begin July 27.\nThe force also said that a fourth person, 22-year-old Ruksana Begum, was charged with having material likely to be of use for terrorism.\n\nLoad-Date: July 19, 2012"
