    "full text": "Excerpts from ''Prelude to Retaliation: Building a Governmental Consensus on Terrorism'' by George Bush, published in the winter-spring 1987 edition of SAIS Review, the journal of the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, in Washington:\nIn characterizing terrorism as a threat to democratic governments, I am not saying that terrorism has been directed exclusively against democratic governments. Exclusively, no.\nOverwhelmingly, yes. And international terrorism - either that sponsored by states like Libya or by large, free-lance groups like Abu Nidal - has, in particular, been an antidemocratic phenomenon. One-third of all international terrorist attacks in recent years were directed at American targets. Of these, 98 percent occurred overseas. In one way or another, the large majority of the rest were aimed at the industrial democracies, and against fledgling democracies, particularly in Latin America, and against Israel.\nIt became clear that combating terror had to take a high priority in our government. We found that the government was already spending $2 billion and employing 18,000 people - measured in man-years - in the fight against terrorism. This suggested that the battle already had a high priority. But it also became clear that in some areas we needed to do more. These areas included assisting other governments, improving security for ships and planes and U.S. facilities overseas, hiring more intelligence personnel, enacting more effective laws, working more closely with the families of hostages, increasing cooperation amoung nations, paying greater attention to the media during hostage crises, and collecting more and better intelligence. And it became clear that we had to be able to respond with force against attacks on Americans."
