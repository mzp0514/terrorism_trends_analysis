Moral pardon is a fact of one's conscience and    should not be exploited,\" she said.\n \n     Some commentators, including some political figures, go so far as    to say that those backing an amnesty have been duped by terrorists who    only want to get out of jail and resume their fight.\n \n     \"It's still too soon,\" said Maria Silvia Rossa, whose labor    organizer husband was killed in 1979. \"And then, who's to say that    under the ashes there's not some flame and that the Red Brigades won't    come back? Not under the same name, perhaps, but maybe their younger    brothers.\"\n \n     Public opinion polls are clear on the matter. A survey in Europeo    magazine said 66 percent of those polled were against a general amnesty    or other clemency for terrorists. Seventy-three percent said they were    afraid of a resumption of terrorism in Italy.\n \n     The \"years of lead\" in Italy refers to the years in which the Red    Brigades and other splinter terrorist groups that grew out of the    political upheavals of 1968 attempted to wage an \"armed struggle\"    against the state based on complicated sociological theory. \"Lead\" is    slang for bullets.\n \n     At the same time, extreme right-wing terrorist groups also took    their toll.\n \n     Since 1969, more than 400 people in Italy have died in 14,000    terrorist attacks and more than 1,100 were injured. Of the dead, 149    were killed by left-wing terrorists, 26 by right-wing terrorists, 63 by    international terrorists and 181 by no clear-cut group.\n \n     In 1978, the year Aldo Moro was killed, there were 2,379 terrorist    attacks registered in Italy, leaving 35 people dead. In 1979, the year    in which most attacks took place, 24 died in 2,513 attacks.\n \n     By comparison, in 1987 there were eight terrorist attacks in Italy,    leaving two dead - including Gen. Licio Giorgieri, shot down a little    more than a year ago in the last left-wing political assassination.\n \n     There are nearly 850 people held on terrorism charges; more than    170 are on the run.\n \n     The latest arrest occurred late last month. Antonino Fosso, 30, who    had been at large since 1981, was arrested near the home of a leading    Christian Democrat, Ciriaco de Mita. Police believe Fosso and a group    of Red Brigades may have been plotting an attack on De Mita.\n \n     The question of a possible amnesty has ripped open wounds that were    only partly healed in the first place, and has called into question the    government's earlier methods in combatting terrorism, which included    use of informers who were released or given light sentences for turning    state's evidence.\n \n     Supporters of clemency point to the fact that informers who have    confessed to multiple homicides are free and on the street, while    others convicted of lesser crimes are behind bars.\n \n     One of the prime examples of such an informer is Marco Donat    Cattin. Like many Red Brigades terrorists, he is from a well-to-do    Catholic family, the son of veteran Christian Democrat politician Carlo    Donat Cattin, who is Italy's health minister.\n \n     Marco killed three people in 1979, two of them in political    assassinations. He was sentenced to only eight years in jail. Now free,    he served seven years, the last two in either semi-liberty or house    arrest.\n \n     Franco Piperno's re-entry into Italy has added more fuel to the    controversy over amnesty. He was whisked away by police as soon as he    stepped off the plane, but gave a number of TV interviews before his    return.\n \n     In these, he made no move toward rejecting his philosophy. He held    the state responsible for the \"years of lead,\" and outraged public    opinion by equating the terrorists killed by police with victims of    terrorist assassination.\n \n     \"He reminded me of those Japanese soldiers who continued to fight    in the jungle 30 and 40 years after the war was over,\" said a    Communist party deputy, Luciano Violante. \"He's completely out of    tune.\"\n \n    \n\nGraphic\n\n \nBLACK AND WHITE PHOTO; Former Prime Minister Aldo Moro.\n\nLoad-Date: November 10, 1992"
