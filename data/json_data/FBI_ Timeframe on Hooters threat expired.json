    "full text": "BLOOMINGTON - A threatening letter sent to a Bloomington restaurant was one of several dozen sent to chain members nationwide, and the timeframe for the attack mentioned in the letters has since expired, an FBI official said. \nSpecial Agent Jon Cauthen of the FBIs Sacramento field office said it seems letters sent to Hooters restaurants, including one on Hershey Road in Bloomington, originated from northern California. A domestic terrorism squad with the FBIs joint terrorism task force is still investigating the letters, he said. \n\"We have lots of leads, its ongoing and were aggressively working on it,\" Cauthen said. \nMailing the threatening letters in interstate commerce is a federal crime, Cauthen said, and his office has previously tracked down people for prosecution in similar cases. He said the case is not unusual, and his field office alone is working on many cases with similar circumstances. \n\"I would say we open a case of that nature here in Sacramento on, probably, a monthly basis,\" Cauthen said. \nCauthen said he did not know the motivation behind the letters. \n\nLoad-Date: March 28, 2006"
