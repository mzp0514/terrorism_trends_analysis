(AP) -- A Washington state man accused of releasing thousands of animals from cages at mink farms in Wisconsin and other states was sentenced Friday to two years in federal prison.\nJustin Clayton Samuel, 21, of Snohomish, Wash., pleaded guilty this fall to two counts of animal enterprise terrorism. Prosecutors said the conviction was the first in the United States under the federal animal enterprise terrorism statute.\nMagistrate Judge Stephen Crocker also ordered Samuel to pay $ 364,106 in restitution to affected farmers.\nSamuel and Peter D. Young, of Mercer Island, Wash., were indicted two years ago in Madison on charges of interfering with interstate commerce during a 1997 cross-country trip through several Midwestern states.\nThe pair were accused of freeing about 3,600 minks from Wisconsin farms in Independence, Medford, Granton and Tomahawk in October 1997.\nSamuel was arrested last year without incident in Belgium. Young has been indicted but is still at large, prosecutors said.\nThe FBI accused the pair of using a list of mink ranches compiled by the Animal Liberation Front to open animal cages in several states.\nThe organization has claimed responsibility for vandalism at several mink farms nationwide since 1996.\n\nLoad-Date: November 6, 2000"
