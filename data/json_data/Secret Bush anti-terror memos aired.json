    "full text": "WASHINGTON — The Obama administration threw open the curtain on years of Bush-era secrets Monday, revealing anti-terror memos that claimed exceptional search-and-seizure powers and divulging that the CIA destroyed nearly 100 videotapes of interrogations and other treatment of terror suspects.\nThe Justice Department released nine legal opinions showing that, following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the Bush administration determined that certain constitutional rights would not apply during the coming fight. Within two weeks, government lawyers were already discussing ways to wiretap U.S. conversations without warrants.\nThe Bush administration eventually abandoned many of the legal conclusions, but the documents themselves had been closely held. By releasing them, President Barack Obama continued a house-cleaning of the previous administration's most contentious policies.\n\"Too often over the past decade, the fight against terrorism has been viewed as a zero-sum battle with our civil liberties,\" Attorney General Eric Holder said in a speech a few hours before the documents were released. \"Not only is that school of thought misguided, I fear that in actuality it does more harm than good.\"\nThe Obama administration also acknowledged in court documents Monday the CIA destroyed 92 videos involving terror suspects, including interrogations — far more than had been known. Congressional Democrats and other critics have charged that some of the harsh interrogation techniques amounted to torture, a contention President George W. Bush and other Bush officials rejected.\nThe new administration pledged Monday to begin turning over documents related to the videos to a federal judge and to make as much information public as possible.\nThe legal memos written by the Bush administration's Office of Legal Counsel show a government grappling with how to wage war on terrorism in a fast-changing world. The conclusion, reiterated in page after page of documents, was the president had broad authority to set aside constitutional rights.\nFourth Amendment protections against unwarranted search and seizure, for instance, did not apply in the United States as long as the president was combating terrorism, the Justice Department said in an Oct. 23, 2001, memo.\n\"First Amendment speech and press rights may also be subordinated to the overriding need to wage war successfully,\" Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo wrote, adding later: \"The current campaign against terrorism may require even broader exercises of federal power domestically.\"\nOn Sept. 25, 2001, Yoo discussed possible changes to the laws governing wiretaps for intelligence gathering. In that memo, he said the government's interest in keeping the nation safe following the terrorist attacks might justify warrantless searches.\nThat memo did not specifically attempt to justify the government's warrantless wiretapping program, but it provided part of the foundation.\nThe memos reflected a belief within the Bush administration that the president had broad powers that could not be checked by Congress or the courts. That stance, in one form or another, became the foundation for many policies: holding detainees at Guantanamo Bay, eavesdropping on U.S. citizens without warrants, using tough new CIA interrogation tactics and locking U.S. citizens in military brigs without charges.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nASSOCIATED PRESS In memos from 2001, seen above after their release Monday, the Bush administration claimed the military could search and seize terror suspects in the United States without warrants.Eric Holder\n\nLoad-Date: March 3, 2009"
