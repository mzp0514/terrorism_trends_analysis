Priest Drive for several months and had not been operated recently, said Maricopa County Sheriff's spokesman Deputy Doug Matteson.\nThe manager of the store found the items about 5 p.m. and called police, Matteson said.\nMatteson would not give specifics on the documents, nor would he say why terrorism investigators were involved.\n\"We're not sure what we have,\" Matteson said.\nOther similar trucks were parked near the one being searched, and Matteson said investigators had yet to decide whether to search them too. \"They have a lot of work with just this one,\" he said.\nIn the coming days, investigators will study the documents to figure out whether they point to a specific threat, he said.\nTo see more of The Tribune, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.eastvalleytribune.com.
