McFarlane (Op-Ed, Oct. 23):\n  On the 25th anniversary of the Oct. 23 bombings of the United States Marine and French paratroop barracks in Beirut, Mr. Gaddo and Mr. McFarlane opined that had we retaliated with military force against the newly formed Hezbollah, we might have prevented the spread of radical Islamic militancy. \n  As one who arrived in Lebanon in 1954 as a student at the American University of Beirut and has returned frequently to the Middle East over the years, I believe that our first line of defense is to understand where the wellspring of support for terrorism lies.\n  We need to comprehend and address a century of frustration in the region with Western colonial control, the exploitation of oil, the establishment of Israel on what Arabs considered their land, their love-hate relationship with Western popular culture, and their mostly unsuccessful attempts to build their own national governments.\n  My husband, Malcolm H. Kerr, was president of the American University of Beirut at the time of the Marine barracks explosion. He was assassinated three months later by Hezbollah. More so-called weapons for peace would not have saved his life nor deterred the spread of terrorism.\n  Ann Kerr   Palisades, Calif., Oct. 28, 2008\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: November 2, 2008"
