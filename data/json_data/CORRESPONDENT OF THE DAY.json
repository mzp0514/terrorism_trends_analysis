    "full text": "He stands with the CIA\nEDITOR, TIMES-DISPATCH:\n The recent release of the report from a Democratic Senate committee regarding the CIA and its interrogation techniques has me quite concerned. While the biased report claims the procedures led to no meaningful or valuable information, President Obama's own CIA chief has refuted this completely. So have seven or eight former directors and assistant directors. In fact, the report seems false, misleading and completely biased.\n I beg to differ with the president's position that such tactics increase the strength of terrorism throughout the world. Failure to act increases terrorism around the world? (Remember the first World Trade Center bombing, the Kenyan embassy bombings and the USS Cole - to name a few?) I say condemning your own country, as this report does, increases terrorism around the world. I say porous borders help increase the threat of terrorism. I say willful disregard for laws and the Constitution here at home contribute to the growth of terrorism around the world. I say that apologizing for U.S. \"oppression\" (liberation and building) increases the threats of terrorism around the world.\n The techniques used in response to the World Trade Center bombings, anthrax scares and other threats to Americans led to no further successful terrorist acts on American soil. I honestly care less about the perpetrators of 9/11 and their rights than I do about the rights of American citizens and the families of those almost 3,000 Americans who were killed by these people.\n I stand firmly with those entrusted to protect Americans every day and I will continue to do just that.\n JIM HERRING.\n HENRICO.\n\nLoad-Date: December 17, 2014"
