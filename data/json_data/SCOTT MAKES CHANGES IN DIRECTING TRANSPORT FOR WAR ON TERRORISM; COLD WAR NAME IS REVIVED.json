    "full text": "In a ceremony Wednesday at Scott Air Force Base, the Air Mobility Command revived the name of the 18th Air Force from the Cold War as the entity that will now direct transport for the war on terrorism.\nBased at Scott, the 18th replaces the 21st Air Force based in New Jersey and the 15th Air Force based in California, both of which have been redesignated as expeditionary mobility task forces.\nGen. John W. Handy said the change will \"consolidate command and control,\" and not just shift names on the organizational chart. He called it the most dramatic reorganization since the Air Mobility Command was established in 1992.\nHandy heads both the Air Mobility Command and its parent organization, the U.S. Transportation Command.\nThe 18th Air Force will be headed by a three-star general. Handy said he expected President George W. Bush to nominate the Transportation Command operations director, Maj. Gen. William Welser III, for the job.\nWelser is a native of Mineola, N.Y., who began his Air Force career 32 years ago - in aircraft maintenance. He has been at Scott since July 2001 and served a previous tour here from 1994 to 1997.\nFor now, the 18th's reins have been taken over by Maj. Gen. Paul W. Essex, the Air Mobility Command's plans and programs director.\nEssex said Wednesday's ceremony reveals an evolution in the Air Mobility Command that began more than a decade ago.\n\"We have removed layers of our organization and made ourselves more efficient,\" he said.\nThe command will operate with fewer people, both at Scott and worldwide, but exact numbers have yet to be decided, he said.\n\nNotes\n\nReporter Robert Goodrich; E-mail: rgoodrich@post-dispatch.com; Phone: 618-235-8919  \n\nLoad-Date: October 3, 2003"
