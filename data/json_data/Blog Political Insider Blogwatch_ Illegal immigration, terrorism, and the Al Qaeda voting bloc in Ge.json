This is a pivotal issue for the future of America. We have to have the intestinal fortitude to protect all Americans.\"\nDon't dismiss this as a stray stab of hyperbole. D.A. King, the illegal immigration activist who supports Whitehead, allegedly said much the same thing at an April 28 meeting of the Newton County Republican party.\n\"They're not here to mow your lawn --- they're here to blow up your buildings and kill your children, and you, and me,\" King was quoted as saying.\nJerry Gonzalez, executive director of of the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials, has been berating GOP officials in attendance, urging them to put distance between themselves and King's remarks. Without much luck.\n\nLoad-Date: May 14, 2007"
