Dr Fayemi while assenting to the bill at a brief ceremony at the Jibowu Hall, Government House, Ado- Ekiti, reiterated his earlier assertion that the Amotekun outfit was not a substitute for existing security agencies but a complementary agency that would enhance and sustain the existing security architecture in the Southwest region of the Country.\n He explained that the Amotekun corps in collaboration with similar security agencies in other states would cooperate and assist police and other security agencies in gathering information about crime, arrest and prosecution of persons suspected or involved in kidnapping, terrorism, cattle rustling, cultism, highway robbery, illegal mining, trespass to farmland, illegal logging and other nefarious activities in the State and the Southwest zone. The Governor said the signing of the law backing Amotekun has fostered strong relationship among south west states, in addition to revealing the quest by Ekiti people and the Yoruba race to address security challenges bedevilling the region.\n\nLoad-Date: March 16, 2020"
