    "full text": "The trial of four men accused of conspiring to support terrorism will continue despite the war with Iraq, a federal judge ruled Monday.\nLast week, defense attorneys filed a motion asking U.S. District Judge Gerald Rosen to adjourn the trial, saying a fair trial would be impossible in wartime.\nBut Rosen said that prospective jurors had been asked whether they could set aside feelings about the war and that he believed a fair panel could be chosen. Jury selection began last week.\n\"We simply do not know or cannot know when we could pick a time in the foreseeable future when the trial of the issues in this case would be more likely to occur in (an) uncharged, completely calm setting,\" he said.\nCharged with conspiracy to provide material support or resources to terrorists are Karim Koubriti, 24; Ahmed Hannan, 34; Farouk Ali-Haimoud, 22; and Abdel-Ilah Elmardoudi, 37.\nTheir trial is the first in the United States for an alleged terrorist cell detected after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The case began with a raid on an apartment in Detroit less than a week after the attacks.\nJury selection, which began last week, resumed Monday with 14 more prospective jurors being questioned. Selection was to continue today.\nRosen also repeated Monday that required evidence must be turned over to the defense, or expert witnesses would be unable to testify.\n\nLoad-Date: March 25, 2003"
