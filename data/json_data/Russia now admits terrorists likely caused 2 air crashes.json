    "full text": "A top Russian official acknowledged yesterday what many citizens already suspected - that terrorism was the most likely cause of two jetliners crashing minutes apart on Tueday, a feeling reflected in a newspaper headline warning that \"Russia now has a Sept. 11.\"\nA day after officials stressed there were many possibilities besides terrorism, presidential envoy Vladimir Yakovlev told Russia's ITAR-Tass news agency that the main theory \"all the same remains terrorism.\"\nYakovlev said the planes' flight recorders provide no clues to the disaster. He said both boxes had shut off abruptly without any indication of trouble, a sign U.S. aviation experts said was strong evidence of explosions. The crashed killed 89 people.\nAlso, Transport Minister Igor Levitin confirmed Sibir airlines' report that its crew had activated an emergency signal shortly before the plane disappeared from radar. Visiting the crash site, however, he said that details were slim because \"no verbal confirmation from the crew was received\" saying what the problem was.\nOfficials previously said there was no indication of trouble from a Volga-Aviaexpress airliner that also crashed late Tuesday, although people on the ground reported hearing a series of explosions.\nRussian media also raised questions about a possible link between the crashes and an explosion a few hours earlier at a bus stop on a road leading to Domodedovo airport, where the two doomed planes took off. Without citing evidence, the reports suggested the blast, which wounded four people, might have been an effort to distract attention.\nSuspicions of terrorism came after warnings from officials that separatists might plan attacks before an election this Sunday in Chechnya to replace the war-torn region's assassinated pro-Kremlin president. The rebels have made attacks in Moscow and other cities, hijacked planes outside Russia and allegedly staged suicide bombings. *\n\nLoad-Date: August 30, 2005"
