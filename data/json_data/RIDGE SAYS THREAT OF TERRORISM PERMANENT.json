The plan will focus government resources where the risks are the highest, where most lives can be saved and most property can be protected, he said.\n\"It will reveal what we need to protect. It will outline the resources available to us, and point the way for their best use. And it will institutionalize our response over the course of several years,\" Ridge said in a draft of his address.\nBioterrorism, for example, poses one of the greatest threats for massive loss of life \"and our preparedness has historically lagged behind the threat,\" Ridge said.\nAfter the Sept. 11, President Bush named the former Pennsylvania governor to be the White House's point man for domestic defense programs.\nRidge said the fear of terrorism has receded for many Americans since Sept. 11.\n\"But the world is just as dangerous today, if not more so,\" he said.\n\"The threat is real as real as it was seven months ago. In fact, it is a permanent condition to which we all must permanently adapt.\"\n\nLoad-Date: April 30, 2002"
