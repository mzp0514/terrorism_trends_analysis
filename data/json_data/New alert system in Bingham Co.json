It also includes an online community watch program, crime map, sex offender map and other features available to residents of Bingham County.\nHardwicke said residents also can engage in neighborhood discussion on recent crimes. \"\"It's just another tool for crime prevention,\"\" he said.\nTo sign up to receive the alert messages, visit www.alertID.com.\n\nLoad-Date: February 26, 2012"
