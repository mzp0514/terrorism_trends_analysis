Most senators questioning him suggested he was likely to win confirmation easily. But after the hearing, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said he planned to place a hold on his nomination, joining another senior Republican senator who has made the same pledge.\nIn answers to a committee prehearing questionnaire Johnson said his top three priorities were filling vacancies at the department, addressing low morale and terrorism - priorities which say less about the terror threat to the U.S. and more about what's happened to the sprawling bureaucracy created after the 9/11 attacks.\nTen years after the department was formed, the mere challenge of running the agency has overtaken countering terrorism. And Congress appears to be OK with that, as senators on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee did not raise any issue with Johnson's priority list.\nOklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn, however, the leading Republican on the committee, said he was concerned that Johnson's written answers to customary prehearing questions used the same language in 23 instances as several other Obama administration nominees.\n\"They're not your answers,\" Coburn said to Johnson. \"The point is to get your thoughts.\"\nCoburn said he wouldn't consider the questionnaire complete until the committee received new answers to the questions. Coburn also said he expected Johnson's nomination to win Senate approval.\nJohnson, a multimillionaire attorney who was largely unknown in homeland security circles before his nomination, was greeted in the hearing room by a small group of protesters decrying his role as a former top Defense Department lawyer who authorized U.S. drone strikes abroad.\nSome have questioned whether he has the requisite law enforcement and management experience to run a department responsible for enforcing immigration and trade laws, securing the nation's borders, protecting the president, and countering drugs and terrorism.\nJohnson said he does have the right experience, and Republicans, Democrats, some state and local law enforcement executives and the past three Homeland Security secretaries agree.\nJohnson's resume was not among the reasons there are holds on his nomination.\nMcCain said he would block the nomination because Johnson \"refused to tell me that he would give me the information as to what is necessary to have 90 percent effective control of our border.\"\n\"I'm a member of that committee. I live in a border state. I think I need the information,\" McCain said. Johnson told McCain during the hearing that he didn't have specific border enforcement details and said he was \"inclined\" to get that information to McCain, if he's confirmed.\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., previously had promised to block Johnson's nomination in an effort to compel the Obama administration to make the survivors of the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya, available to speak with lawmakers. But that was not personal either. Graham has promised to block the president's nominee to run the Federal Reserve for the same reason.\nCurrently, roughly 40 percent of the senior leadership positions are vacant at the department, and it has long been ranked among the federal agencies with the lowest morale.\n\nLoad-Date: November 14, 2013"
