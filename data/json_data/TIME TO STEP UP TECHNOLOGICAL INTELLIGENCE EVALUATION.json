To me, that is a key.\nSome people seem to think that it is a failure of surveillance technology that allows security threats to slip through. I think that the technology we now have to collect information is adequate to prevent almost all threats if only we could use it effectively.\nUmar Farouk Abdulmutallab's name was known to U.S. anti-terrorism authorities because of a phone call from his father to the U.S. embassy in Nigeria. But no one found out that Mr. Abdulmutallab held a valid U.S. visa because someone misspelled his name in the search of a database.\nHis name was placed on one of the multiple anti-terrorism watch lists.\nSome have said the problem is that there are hundreds of thousands of names on these lists. But a big-city phone book could contain hundreds of thousands of names, yet finding an individual's phone number takes just moments. When that information is in a database, it is a matter of seconds.\nHis name did not make it to the no-fly list, which has only about 4,000 names on it. It also did not make a less selective list of 14,000 that would have assured that Mr. Abdulmutallab would have to undergo a more rigorous second screening before boarding.\nThe Los Angeles Times reported that Homeland Security did note Mr. Abdulmutallab's name on another watch list after his plane was in the air. But presence on that list would not have resulted in more scrutiny before boarding -- only questioning after arriving.\nThe point here is that we have ample technology to collect information to make lists, but lack the technology to evaluate the information we have collected and get it to the people who need it.\nIf anything, we probably collect too much information.\nIn James Bamford's book about the National Security Agency and its role in the events of 9/11, \"The Shadow Factory,\" he describes our intelligence agencies as awash in a sea of information.\nAfter 9/11 and the Bush administration's stretching of the rules of surveillance, the sea of information became an ocean.\nAccording to Mr. Bamford, the NSA has managed to tap into the fiber optic switches in the United States and other countries. This allows them to monitor millions of communications as they enter the system from overseas cables and elsewhere.\nWe have the technology to store all this information. And the NSA, according to Mr. Bamford, has sophisticated computer algorithms that can \"flag\" certain suspicious words.\nBut the state of our technology today seems to fall far short in being able to discern meaning and significance. For example, much of the meaning in spoken communication is transmitted by tone and context. Machines don't understand that at this point -- only humans do.\nIf the NSA employed enough humans to analyze all the information it collects, it would employ more people than any 10 of the world's largest corporations.\nTotalitarian regimes try to solve this problem by having citizens spy on fellow citizens. That way humans interpret the meaning of information before it is collected. We obviously don't believe in that.\nSo a great deal of information is collected, then shunted into storage without further examination.\nWhat we need to know is buried in the avalanche of what we know.\nAdd that to the fact that government agencies don't always pass along what they collect to other agencies and that there are numerous watch lists maintained by numerous agencies, and no one should be surprised when a name is sucked up by the anti-terrorism vacuum but never spit out to someone who can use it.\nSo what we must develop and are developing is technology that can dive into that sea of facts and pluck out that one poisonous fish.\n\nNotes\n\nRead TechMan's blog at post-gazette.com/techman.
