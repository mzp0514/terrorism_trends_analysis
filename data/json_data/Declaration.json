    "full text": "The attempted Christmas bombing of a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit had many of the elements: a jihadist bent on a suicide attack had ties to al-Qaida. The incident and its aftermath sent us to our files, where we found this, in an editorial regarding the crash of TWA Flight 800 (which, despite early fears, ultimately was not attributed to terrorism):\n***************\n War means...war.\n Which means President Clinton ought to seek from Congress a declaration of war against terrorism. And Congress ought to cast partisanship aside and approve a declaration authorizing extraordinary steps against terrorists.\n Prudent security measures at airports will help, but nations don't win wars by hunkering down. They win by taking the offensive. Numerous stories and articles have referred to camps offering training, as well as moral and logistical support. Take the camps out. Before terrorists strike again. The countries sponsoring terrorism - and surely the U.S. knows who they are - have military facilities of their own: e.g., forts, navy bases, air fields. Take them out.\n Now.\n***************\n The editorial bore the headline \"War Against Terror\" and appeared in The Times-Dispatch in 1996 - on Sept. 11.\n Reality was not that difficult to see then; it is not that difficult to see now.\n\nLoad-Date: February 27, 2010"
