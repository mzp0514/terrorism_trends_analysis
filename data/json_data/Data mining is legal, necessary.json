Mukasey wrote in The Wall Street Journal: Every time we tell terrorists how we can detect them, we encourage them to find ways to avoid detection.\nSnowden's revelations about the National Security Agency's widespread data-mining did not expose any illegal activity. The program monitors the time and duration of phone calls. It does not reveal the calls' content.  \nThe process, which began seven years ago, is legal under the Patriot Act and is scrutinized by the special court  created by Congress in the 2008 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\nAnother National Security Agency program monitors foreign-to-foreign calls, which also is legal under FISA.\nWithout question, such a extensive surveillance program merits concern, but there is no evidence it has been abused.\nThere is, however, evidence data mining has helped the United State stop terrorism.\nThe New York Times on Saturday detailed how the computers' detection of an email sent to Pakistan enabled investigators to eventually detect a man's plot to plant backpack bombs in the New York subway.  \nTampa lives may have been saved by the surveillance program. The New York Times reports when Congress prepared to extend the law covering the data mining last December, cases were cited that included plots to bomb the New York Federal Reserve Bank, the United States Capitol, locations in Tampa, Fla., and New York City and troops returning from combat overseas.\nThe Tampa case apparently involved a 25-year-old man who was arrested by the FBI in a sting operation. Officials said he tried to buy explosives, at least 10 grenades, Uzis and an AK-47. \nAs the Tribune's Elaine Silvestrini reported in January 2012, Sami Osmakac of Pinellas Park, was charged with attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction.\nOfficials said he was targeting a popular South Tampa pub.\nHaving the government determine where phone calls are coming or going - not what is being said - is hardly a gross invasion of privacy as Snowden claims. Indeed, the very scale of the surveillance makes it less of a threat to individuals. As the Wall Street Journal pointed out in an editorial Monday, the data collected is so massive that only algorithms can understand them. The search is for trends, patterns, associations, networks. They are not in that sense invasions of individual privacy at all.\nThis is an encouraging case where President Barack Obama has reconsidered his views. Prior to his election, Obama was disdainful of President George W. Bush's anti-terrorism efforts.\nBut once in office, and entrusted with the nation's security, the president came to see the importance of such operations to detect terrorists and protect Americans.\nHe also came to understand that scrutinizing data is no threat to the public's privacy or civil liberties. \nHe correctly summed up the matter the other day:  Nobody is listening to your telephone calls. That is not what this program's about.\n\nLoad-Date: September 25, 2013"
