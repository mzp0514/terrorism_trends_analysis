    "full text": "LONDON -- The partner of Glenn Greenwald, the journalist who published information leaked by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden, lost his legal challenge on Wednesday over his nine-hour detention at London's Heathrow Airport last August under counterterrorism laws. Mr. Greenwald's partner, David Michael Miranda, was stopped while in transit from Germany to Brazil and was told he was being detained under Section 7 of the British Terrorism Act.\nThe piece of legislation allows the authorities to detain someone for up to nine hours for questioning and to conduct a search of personal items, often without a lawyer, to determine possible ties to terrorism. Officers seized items including electronic media containing an estimated 58,000 documents from the N.S.A. and its British counterpart.\nMr. Miranda, who is Brazilian, has said he was simply transporting material for Mr. Greenwald and appealed against his detention, arguing that it was unlawful and that it breached human rights. But at the High Court on Wednesday, Judge John Laws ruled that the detention was a ''proportionate measure in the circumstances,'' and that its objective was ''not only legitimate, but pressing.''\nMr. Miranda has applied for permission to appeal against Wednesday's decision, his lawyers said.\nThis is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/20/world/europe/snowdens-partner-detention.html\n\nLoad-Date: February 20, 2014"
