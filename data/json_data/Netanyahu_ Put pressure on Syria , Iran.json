    "full text": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed Iran and Syria for increasing terrorism on Israel and said he would push for increased international pressure against them.\nIn an interview published today in the Maariv newspaper, Netanyahu said that combating terrorism required more than just military efforts.\nThe solution is \"to consolidate an understanding with the United States and to enact an international policy,\" Netanyahu said. The international anti- terrorism conference in Sharm el-Sheik, Egypt in March was a beginning, he said, but \"now we have to give it teeth.\"\nNetanyahu's comments were the latest in an escalating war of words between his hard-line government and Damascus, which compared him to Adolf Hitler in a government newspaper on Thursday.\nThe Al-Baath newspaper charged in an editorial that \"Netanyahu is aspiring to become the leader of new fascism and racism and to retrieve the aggressive history of Hitler.\"\nMeanwhile, Palestinian officials were unimpressed with the new hard-line government's first contact with Yasser Arafat after 10 days in power - a secret visit by the prime minister's top policy adviser.\n\"The issue is not who meets who, but the implementation of the peace agreement,\" said Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian minister of municipal affairs.\n\nLoad-Date: December 9, 1996"
