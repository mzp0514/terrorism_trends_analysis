    "full text": "In the first trial of a prominent Chechen leader, rebel commander Salman Raduyev was found guilty of terrorism and murder Tuesday and sentenced to life in a maximum-security prison.\nRussia's top prosecutor, Vladimir Ustinov, personally directed the case, underlining the importance the government put on punishing Raduyev and three co-defendants for a bloody raid in January 1996 on a town in the Russian republic of Dagestan.\nRaduyev led the January 1996 raid on the southern Russian town of Kizlyar in which 78 people were killed. He and other rebels took hundreds of hostages at a local hospital and used some of them as human shields.\nBesides terrorism, Raduyev and three accomplices were charged with banditry, hostage-taking and organizing murders.\n\"I couldn't care less if I get a life sentence,\" Raduyev said during a break in the court session. \"I have died three times already, I can spend my life in prison, I have no regrets.\"\nRaduyev, who was wounded several times, has said that he only obeyed orders from the late rebel President Dzhokhar Dudayev during the Kizlyar raid. Raduyev was commander of Dudayev's army.\nThe court sentenced Raduyev's accomplice Turpal-Ali Atgeriyev to 15 years in prison, Aslanbek Alkhazurov to eight years in prison, and Khusein Gaisumov to five years.\nDefense attorneys said they would appeal.\n\nLoad-Date: December 26, 2001"
