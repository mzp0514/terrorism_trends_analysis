Bush will visit Argonne today and is expected to view demonstrations of some of the lab's creations that could be used to fight terrorism and defend the homeland.\nThe president also is expected to talk about the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and how the nation can use new technology for protection, said Scott Stanzel, a White House spokesman.\nArgonne, a national laboratory located west of Chicago, was chosen for Bush's visit because it is one of the nation's oldest labs and because of its efforts for homeland defense, Stanzel said.\nArgonne is owned by the U.S. Department of Energy and run by the University of Chicago. Scientists conduct research in various areas, such as high-energy physics, biotechnology, transportation, chemistry, mathematics and computer science.\nHarvey Drucker, coordinator of Argonne's national security research, said the lab began many of the projects related to homeland defense years ago. But after the terrorist attacks, the lab recognized some of those projects could be further developed for other uses.\nFor example, the lab already had created a monitor to detect anthrax that could be used in a battlefield during the Persian Gulf War. After Sept. 11, lab officials realized the same technology could be used in detectors that could be placed in buildings or subway systems, Drucker said.\n\"This is not a defense laboratory. We don't think about weapons,\" Drucker said. \"But we are pretty good at doing science and developing new technologies.\"\nAnother new development is a chemical sensor to detect cyanide gas or other lethal chemicals.\n\"We're not the only ones who have developed them, but we have made very small devices that have high sensitivity that can give you a quick analy sis,\" Drucker said.\nThe lab also has developed a portable detector for finding concealed nuclear weapons.\n\"It's a small device that, with the appropriate sensitivity, not only can tell you that there are radioactive materials present, but it can tell you what kinds of materials are present,\" Drucker said.\n\nNotes\n\nA shorter version of this report ran in the FIVE STAR LIFT, page B2.\n\nLoad-Date: July 22, 2002"
