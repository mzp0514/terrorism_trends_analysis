    "full text": "A Republican Party telephone blitz linking some Hillary Rodham Clinton backers to the bombing of a U.S. warship abruptly ended yesterday, less than 24 hours after the GOP had vowed to continue it.\n\"We called as many people as we were going to call with that message,\" said Dan Allen, a spokesman for the Republican State Committee. \"The chairman is done with that script.\"\nOn Saturday, Clinton had denounced the calls, which exploited for political gain the deaths of 17 sailors in the Cole bombing, as a \"new low\" in the Senate race.\nAllen denied that the criticism played a role, and said that a related series of calls targeting Jewish voters - with a script that makes no mention of the Cole bombing - would continue.\nClinton responded at a campaign stop in Rochester: \"I think that they were embarrassed . . . it was something they were trying to do below the radar screen.\"\nSen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), appearing with Clinton, questioned whether the GOP could have reached its goal of making 500,000 calls so soon. The calls only began Thursday.\nRick Lazio, Clinton's Senate foe, again sought to distance himself from the phone banks. \"That is a state committee matter,\" he said.\nHe declined to say whether he agreed with the calls, but added, \"The real story here is that you have one candidate who is receiving money from people who affiliate themselves with people who support terrorism.\"\nIn the calls, voters were told Clinton's campaign took $50,000 from an \"Arab organization that openly brags about its support of a Mideast terrorism group, conducting the same kind of terrorism that killed 17 of our sailors.\"\nThe calls began after the Daily News reported that the American Muslim Alliance had claimed credit for sponsoring a $50,000 fund-raiser for Clinton.\nThe News quoted the group's leader as saying that although he backs achieving a Palestinian state through peaceful means, UN resolutions allow armed force. But neither the leader nor other alliance members said they support terrorism.\nClinton returned the $50,000 after the story appeared, saying she was unaware of the alliance's role and was offended by remarks attributed to members.\nMeanwhile, Clinton and Lazio visited black churches yesterday, receiving reactions that reflected different levels of support among black voters.\nLazio spoke for nine minutes at the Abyssinian Baptist Church on W. 138th St., focusing on education and the need for taxpayer-funded school vouchers. He said vouchers and competition are the way to help troubled schools.\n\"I think universal high-quality education is the civil rights issue of this new century,\" he said. \"We all want racial equality . . . but we won't get there until we have better schools.\"\nLazio won scattered applause four times during his remarks and polite applause at the end. When Clinton visited the church two weeks ago, she was applauded 15 times and got two standing ovations.\nThe Rev. Calvin Butts spoke warmly of Lazio and urged the congregation to keep an open mind, but he did not invite him to speak from the pulpit, as he did for Clinton.\nIt was Lazio's first visit to a black church this campaign. Advisers had vowed a vigorous effort in normally Democratic black neighborhoods, but Lazio has had to focus the last two months on reversing Clinton's gains in Republican upstate.\nClinton went to two black churches in Buffalo, bringing to 19 the number of such churches she has visited since Sept. 10.\nBoth campaigns said they would roll out heavy hitters in the closing days of the race: President Clinton and Sen. Daniel Moynihan for the First Lady, Sen. John McCain and former Rep. Jack Kemp for Lazio.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nMICHAEL SCHWARTZ ALL SMILES Rick Lazio and wife Patricia take a few moments Sunday to greet Sterling Tilley and his 8-month-old daughter, Arianna, at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem.
