    "full text": "Prime Minister Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo at first couldn't or wouldn't say exactly who was behind the takeover of the Banco Central headquarters in Barcelona last week. In its way, this uncertainty was almost as damaging to Spain's insecure democracy - undermined by terrorism from the Basques and left and right - as if the bank caper had succeeded.\nSpain's Prime Minister Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo cites rightist terroists for bank takeover attempt in Barcelona\nIt didn't. After a 36-hour siege and a battle with police who climbed into the bank from neighboring buildings, the last of 263 hostages were freed unhurt, one of their captors was killed and nine other gunmen were captured.\nLater, the beginnings of a tunnel was discovered that led under a route King Juan Carlos would have crossed today on his way to an Armed Forces Day parade. The tunnel recalled the assassination in 1973 of Prime Minister Luis Carrero Blanco by leftists who planted a bomb under a Madrid street. Police said the Barcelona tunnel led from a building on Casanova Street where the dead gunman had rented a ground-floor room.\nThe gunmen had demanded that Lieut Col. Antonio Tejero Molina and three fellow leaders of the Feb. 23 coup attempt in Madrid be released from prison and flown to Buenos Aires. But Colonel Tejero declined to go and Argentina refused to cooperate.\nSearching for other motives, officials at first hinted at a new Civil Guard plot. Later they said the gunmen were mere common criminals. But after a storm of demands in Parliament for clarification, the Prime Minister said the bank takeover had been directed by ultrarightists."
