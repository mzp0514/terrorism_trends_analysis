    "full text": "On Sept. 11, 2001, I was sitting in my fifth-grade class when my teacher got a phone call. I didn't notice what was going on until her face turned stone white as she turned on the TV. \nThe World Trade Center appeared, crumbling in flames.Confused as to what was going on and why class was dismissed out early, I came home and asked my parents what was going on. They informed me that America had been attacked by terrorists and that our couny was going through a national crisis. Being only nine at the time, I didn't understand what was going on or how something like this could happen to the couny that I loved so dearly.Ever since that day, I feel as if the sense of urgency surrounding national security and terrorism has greatly increased. Before Sept. 11, I did not even consider the possible affects of terrorism. Sept. 11 proved to the nation that terrorism was a reality and that America was not invincible. The idea that our nation could be attacked scared many and paranoia increased.Yet, while it is important to increase security, the worst possible thing that could be done is elevate paranoia. Sept. 11 should be remembered as a day when many brave individuals lost their lives and should serve as a reminder that good things can happen to bad people \"\" millions of them. And instead of becoming paranoid for the future, Sept. 11 should be remembered as a day that brought a nation together.Ten years of recuperation should serve as a dedication to those that died \"\" not as a catalyst for angering our couny. Sept. 11 will always be remembered as the day America learned she was not invincible, and as a day that a nation would display courage and sength. Sept. 11 is a day that shows Americans will never give up.Email Chu at bchu@media.ucla.edu Send general comments to opinion@media.ucla.edu\n\nLoad-Date: March 15, 2016"
