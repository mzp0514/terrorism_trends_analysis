Holding Pakistan responsible for harbouring terrorists, she said it is a country that \"glorifies\" terrorists and \"refuses to see blood of innocents\".\nLast year, Swaraj had berated Pakistan over its continuous support for terror organizations. \"Under the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan, we have begun to shape up a new Pakistan\", he added. \"But within hours, they killed three of our policemen in Kashmir\".\nNo cutoff date for Canada to join NAFTA 2.0: Mexico president-elect\nBut the Canadian prime minister insists that he remains committed to the talks - and the prospect of a breakthrough. However, Canada's transport minister is dismissing the October 1st cutoff as just a creation of the U.S.\n\"Does this indicate a desire for dialogue\", Swaraj asked. Islamabad has also accusedNew Delhi of human rights violations in Kashmir Valley.\n\"Time and again, Pakistan accuses India of human rights violations\", Swaraj said.\nSushma Swaraj said that those who take innocent human lives in pursuit of war by other means are defenders of inhuman behaviour, not of human rights.\nQureshi discussed with the UN Secretary General the first-ever report on Kashmir by the UN High Commission for Human Rights and called for an worldwide probe into the violations of human rights in the held territory. Started after World War 1 to prevent conflicts, the league folded up in 1946 after failing to stop World War 2.\nIn her address to the Assembly which consisted of an attack on Pakistan for sponsoring terror, Ms. Swaraj said: \"In 1996, India proposed a draft document on CCIT at the United Nations. If the United Nations is ineffective, the whole concept of multilateralism will collapse\", the external affairs minister warned.\nIndia on Saturday told the UN General Assembly that countries that have exploited the nature for their immediate needs can not abdicate their responsibilities and developed nations must lift the deprived with financial and technical resources.\nMr Qureshi said that some other nations also recognised Pakistan's strategic location and understood its importance, \"so, we are not alone, everyone has options\".\n\nLoad-Date: September 29, 2018"
