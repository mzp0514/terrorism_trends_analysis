Davis set sentencing for Sept. 18. Under the federal sentencing guidelines, Maria likely faces at least four years in prison, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Whitt.\nMaria's attorney, Kenneth A. Young, did not return a phone call yesterday.\nIn May, another Philadelphia man, Seide Venord, was sentenced to 21/2 years in prison for laundering $267,000 in drug money, also to the Dominican Republic.\nVenord and Maria were licensed money remitters, officials said.\nAlso in May, Mohammed Khurshan, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Bangladesh, pleaded guilty to operating a remitting business without a license and to fraud. ICE agents said that Khurshan had sent more than $900,000 to a Singapore company in increments just below $10,000 - the limit at which banks are required to report the transactions to the Treasury Department.\n\"Money remitters who are willing to move illicit proceeds overseas pose significant homeland-security threats,\" said John Kelleghan, the acting special agent in charge for ICE in the Philadelphia division. \"They serve as magnets for criminal organizations and even terrorist groups looking to wire-transfer their dirty money abroad with no questions asked.\"\nContact staff writer John Shiffman at 215-854-2658 or jshiffman@phillynews.com.\n\nLoad-Date: July 15, 2006"
