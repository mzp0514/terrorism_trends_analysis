    "full text": "President Clinton defended Father Aristide today against the C.I.A.'s suggestions that he is mentally unstable and unfit to lead Haiti.\nMr. Clinton said the views of Administration officials who have worked with Father Aristide to help restore him to power carried more weight than allegations that officials of the agency made to members of Congress this week.\nAnswering questions from reporters after his morning jog, Mr. Clinton said his view that Mr. Aristide was fit to lead Haiti was reinforced by \"everyone else in the Administration in working with him\" and by \"the fact that during the time he served as President, political terrorism and abuses went down.\"\nC.I.A. officials told members of the House and Senate intelligence committees that Father Aristide had ordered the killing of a political opponent and that there was evidence of his mental instability.\nMr. Clinton did not hide his doubts about the agency's critical assessment of the Haitian leader. \"The C.I.A. would be the first to tell you that they get a lot of information,\" he said. \"It's not always accurate. It's not always determinable. But they have to give what they have to the intelligence committee just as they do the President.\"\n\nLoad-Date: October 24, 1993"
