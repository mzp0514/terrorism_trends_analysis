Together we will lead our party back to the White House, and together we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity and peace.\"\nIn Trump's speech, he touched on terrorism, the state of the economy, immigration and what he felt were problems with his opponent, Hillary Clinton, saying she was responsible for many of the world's disasters today, and describing her legacy with words such as \"death,\" \"destruction,\" \"terrorism\" and \"weakness.\"\nTrump said he is the choice of the people over Clinton.\n\"My opponent asks her supporters to support a three-word loyalty pledge. It reads 'I'm with her,'\" he said. \"I choose to recite a different pledge. My pledge reads, 'I'm with you, the American people. I am your voice.\"\n___ (c)2016 The Ironton Tribune (Ironton, Ohio) Visit The Ironton Tribune (Ironton, Ohio) at www.irontontribune.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n\nLoad-Date: July 22, 2016"
