Only one out of the four people said they had donated to the relief fund.\nOf course no one likes to get hassled in the halls for money and many of us don't have any change. There are millions of worthy causes out there and will continue to be in the future.\nHonestly speaking, how can one not donate a few dollars because they think that Canada's problems are more important?\nI'm convinced that their opinion would change if they went to Sri Lanka or Thailand given the circumstances. Every country has problems, but news flash, we are the \"haves\" and those affected countries are the \"have nots.\" They are clearly in need, people are dying and it wouldn't kill any of us to do our part to help out.\n- Lisa Roth first year, travel and tourism\nRon's first response\nThis is a response to Ron James, the author of an article in last week's paper entitled \"Questioning Canada's mythical moral superiority.\" I would like to rebut what he wrote last week, not in the sense that my side is right, rather providing a somewhat intelligent opposition to what he wrote. I know he must think everyone wants to argue with him. Might it be that liberals are the majority in our part of Canada? I start with his view on the greatest Canadian, Tommy Douglas. I do agree with him that MacDonald should have won, however, Douglas' contribution to our social programs, notably health care, are indisputable. He was the first leader of the New Democratic Party; which although does not fit into the two party system of the United States, has become a somewhat powerful force in Canadian politics. Our health care system is one of the uniting factors, which provides Canada with a sense of self. Personally, the health care system here, although flawed in some respects, has saved my life twice.\nIf I were in the United States, I would have paid about $500, 000 for my hospital bills. My family probably could have afforded it in the United States, but what of the people who cannot afford coverage? Are they just left to die?\nAs well, the greatest Canadian was neither a military leader nor a great businessman because it shows what Canadians value ...\"Peace, order, and good government.\" On his point about Trudeau, I feel very strongly about what he did for Canada and Canadian culture.\nAgain on a personal note, my family lived in Montral when the FLQ was commencing their attacks on English Canada. My father's best friend's father worked for the postal service and had his arms blown off by a terrorist attack. My father and my mother both supported Trudeau because of his stance on domestic terrorism. Trudeau helped Canada through being a strong leader in one of our country's most difficult times.\nWith respect to his point on Canada's involvement in America's war on terrorism and ultimately Afghanistan and Iraq, I have to say this: America disobeying the UN's orders, and going to war with no just cause, is the complete opposite to what he thinks of as Canadian values.\nJames' Canadian values include respect for authority (unlike the U.S. going against UN authority), hard work (which I agree with), accountability (the United States is not taking the prerogative in admitting they did not find any weapons of mass destruction), and finally law and order (the United States showing no respect for international law). This is why most Canadians, and why the author should feel that what America did, and is still doing, is wrong.\nI do agree with him that Canada has no real distinct culture of our own. However, we have the potential to become a culturally sovereign state, without hurting our closest ally and friend, the United States.\nOur ability to choose what we want to do means that we do have our own voice. Canada is in crisis right now; we have no real sense of self.\nIt is up to Canadians to decide if we want to follow the footsteps of our southern neighbor, or have a distinct Canadian culture. I think most Canadians would agree that although the United States has a lot of good qualities, it is not what we want to be. With this said, we shouldn't base our culture on \"not being\" another.\n- Eric Laroque second year, history\nTaxicab confessions; 5-0 sets the record straight\nFor the information of all Brock Students, below are the taxi rates in effect for the 2004-2005 school year with 5-0 Taxi:\nBrock to Thorold, $6.00.\nBrock to Pen Centre, $6.00.\nBrock to West St. Catharines, $7.50.\nBrock to Downtown, $7.50.\nBrock to General Hospital & toQEW,$7.50.\nBrock to North of QEW within St. Catharines,$10.00.\nStudents, clip out and save these rates for your reference.\nIf any rate discrepancies are encountered, please call Pat during regular business hours Monday to Friday at (905) 685-6464, extention 222.\nI hope this clarifies any confusion.\n-Lisa Maroney, director of operations, 5-0 Transportation, St. Catharines\n\nLoad-Date: July 16, 2020"
