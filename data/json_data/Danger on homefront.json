The latest theory focuses on the possibility of faulty design in steel plates connecting bridge girders, which, if true, could mean all bridges of similar construction across the country are in similar danger.\nWhether or not the steel plates turn out to be the flaw, Americans are indeed endangered by crumbling infrastructure.\nIt's a danger more immediate than the specter of terrorism, but it's one we've ignored for decades.\nPart of this is the fault of our politicians. Fixing old roads, bridges, sewer and water lines and power grids is a priority that can keep being pushed forward - until the bill comes due in the form of lives lost, as in Minneapolis.\nAnd part of it is the fault of taxpayers, who haven't kept up pressure on the politicians to maintain the nation's infrastructure and allowed elected officials to turn a blind eye to the growing problem.\nThe American Society of Civil Engineers, in a 2005 \"report card,\" graded the United States at an overall \"D\" in national infrastructure and estimated the cost of making necessary repairs to roads, bridges, power lines, dams, aviation, water and sewer systems, rail and transit at $1.6 trillion.\nToo much money? The United States is spending, by some calculations, more than $2 billion a week on the war in Iraq. By contrast, federal estimates show that over the next 20 years, the nation needs $132 billion a year to repair its roads, $390 billion a year for sewer systems and $21.8 billion a year for mass transit.\nIn Pennsylvania, the state estimates $1.7 billion a year is needed for highways and bridges.\nWhere should the money come from?\nPennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell had first proposed that the state lease the Pennsylvania Turnpike to a private operator, with revenues earmarked for roads. But leery of the costs of such a move, the Legislature instead opted to allow the Turnpike Commission to borrow $13 billion over 12 years - with $500 million a year earmarked for road work and $450 million for mass transit - and to repay the loans with higher Turnpike tolls and new tolls on Interstate 80.\nSounds like a plan? Well, two Republican congressmen from central Pennsylvania inserted an amendment into a federal bill that bars tolling I-80.\nThat amendment likely will be sliced from the final bill by majority Democrats in Congress. But it shows the political stakes of allocating more money for road repairs.\nIn Congress, a bipartisan bill aimed at identifying and funding infrastructure needs was introduced, ironically, on Aug. 1, the day the I-35 bridge came down.\nThat catastrophe could be a turning point, if we make it so.\nFighting terrorism has to be a top priority. Yet those who died in the bridge collapse are just as dead as anyone killed by a terrorist.\nAnd if our infrastructure deteriorates, that's just as much a threat to national security and the economy as terrorism.\nWhy does it seem to take a disaster to spur Americans to action?\nLet's bridge the infrastructure gap.\n148 DAYS ... left in terms of County Commissioners Shellenberger and Henderson.\n\nLoad-Date: August 13, 2007"
