Instead, he merely relayed messages for the group from 1997 until he quit in September.\nOver the years, the groups have done tens of millions of dollars in damage in an effort to undermine businesses and government entities they say exploit animals or the environment.\nIn a report the ELF and ALF released this week, the groups claimed responsibility for 137 illegal direct actions in 2001, ranging from petty vandalism to burning down a horticulture building at the University of Washington at an estimated $ 5.4 million in damage.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nFILE/The Associated Press * Animal-rights groups are rallying their members for protests next month outside a House hearing in Washington, D.C., on eco-terrorism, designed as a show of support for Craig Rosebraugh, pictured, a former spokesman for the Earth Liberation Front.\n\nLoad-Date: January 18, 2002"
