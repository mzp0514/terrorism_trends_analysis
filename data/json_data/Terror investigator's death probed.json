Wissam Eid. Among other things, they hoped to learn who owned the car.\n\"Security and judicial police investigators are probing a possible link between Capt. Eid's killing and a series of assassinations that have rocked Lebanon in the last three years,\" the official told The Associated Press. He spoke on condition of anonymity in line with government regulations.\nEid was one of the country's top terrorism investigators who was probing assassinations of prominent anti-Syrian figures and other attacks in recent years, including the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.\nEid, 31, worked for the police intelligence agency which is closely tied to the Western-backed government, and had survived two previous assassination attempts. Friday's attack also killed his bodyguard and three passers-by and wounded 37 people, police said.\nPrime Minister Fuad Saniora, whose Western-backed government is locked in a fierce power struggle with the Syrian-backed opposition, pledged Saturday to pursue \"the criminals who planned and carried out this crime, which is aimed at destroying the state security institutions.\"\n\"The road to independence is fraught with dangers and filled with sacrifices,\" Saniora said.\nPresident Bush condemned the bombing and urged Syria and Iran to stop interfering in Lebanon's politics. \"We will not falter in our support for the democratically-elected Lebanese government,\" Bush said. \"We demand that Syria, Iran, and their allies end their interference in and obstruction of Lebanon's political process.\"\nSyria has been fingered in many of Lebanon's recent bombings, including that of Hariri in 2005. Islamic militants also were suspected in some of the explosions. Damascus has denied the accusations.\nThe blast, which struck midmorning Friday in the Christian neighborhood of Hazmieh in eastern Beirut, came a day after a labor strike that was largely peaceful and 10 days after a car bomb aimed at a U.S. Embassy car killed three bystanders.\nNational Police Chief Brig. Gen. Ashraf Rifi vowed to continue the fight against terrorist groups as he paid tribute to Eid.\n\"Our choice is to defend this country. Our decision is to continue our march to confront the empire of death and terror,\" Rifi said at ceremony to honor Eid and his slain bodyguard.\n\nLoad-Date: January 27, 2008"
