No.\"\nAfter a beat, she continued to say that both Israelis and Palestinians are dying. \"You have to have sympathy for both sides, and all of us in the world need to urge both of them both Palestinians and Israelis try to stop the violence and come to the table,\" she said.\nIn her more muted, formal comments to representatives of the OECD's 30 member countries, Bush offered education as a prescription for the hatred, hopelessness and poverty that she said are root causes of terrorism.\n\"First and foremost, we must teach all the world's children to respect human life their own life, and the lives of others,\" she said. \"With education comes greater self-respect and respect for others. With education comes greater understanding and tolerance.\"\nAides said that, like the president, Bush was particularly troubled by the March 29 incident outside a Jerusalem supermarket where an 18-year-old Palestinian girl, Ayat Akhras, detonated explosives strapped to her body. Akhras killed herself, 17-year-old Rachel Levy and a security guard and wounded 25 other people.\n\"Every parent, every teacher, every leader has a responsibility to condemn the terrible tragedy of children blowing themselves up to kill others,\" Bush told the OECD audience, which listened politely and did not interrupt with applause.\nShe also decried last week's bombing of a holiday parade in Kaspiisk, Russia, where 17 of the more than 40 victims were children, and the suicide bombing that killed 11 French engineers and two Pakistanis in Karachi, Pakistan.\nIn the interview, Bush was at a loss to reconcile her thesis about education and terrorism with the fact that several of the Sept. 11 suicide hijackers were university educated, including ringleader Mohammed Atta, who studied for eight years at the Technical University in Hamburg, Germany.\n\"I don't think you can explain one individual's reason for being a terrorist,\" she said. \"But I think, in general, if citizens are educated in countries around the world, that will help us fight terrorism.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \nJ.
