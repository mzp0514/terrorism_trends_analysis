He believes that he is a victim due to the conduct of the Rwandan Patriotic Front in ending the genocide.\n\"Paul Rusesabagina is a Rwandan accused of crimes that were committed in Rwanda against Rwandan citizens and thus will be tried by a Rwandan court\", Foreign Affairs Minister and government spokesman, Vincent Biruta, said by telephone.\nUS President George W Bush presents his Presidential Medal of Freedom to Paul Rusesabagina, who sheltered people at a hotel he managed during the 1994 Rwandan genocide, at a ceremony in the East Room of the White House in Washington November 9, 2005.\nThe Rwandan government's past attempts to charge his father internationally had failed, he said.\nThe RPF was eventually able to provide aid, allowing Rusesabagina to escape to Tanzania with his family and the refugees.\nPac-12 announces COVID-19 testing initiative for student-athletes\nQuidel's Sofia 2 testing machines and tests are expected to be delivered to each of the Pac-12's athletic departments by the end of September, according to the release.\nHe and his family received threats during the genocide by Hutu extremists.\nMany observers of Rwandan politics are suspicious of the charges against Rusesabagina, because the RPF regime has a record of using prosecution to intimidate opponents.\nRusesabagina took charge of the luxury establishment on April 12, 1994, when ethnic Tutsis were being hunted down across the country. He publicly denounced Kagame in a December 2018 YouTube video and was identified as the leader of the Mouvement Rwandais pour le Changement DÃ©mocratique and the National Forces of Liberation in Burundi.\nThis is a sentiment shared by several human rights groups that have grown more critical of Kagame in recent years. \"What Kagame and Rwanda's ruling party have effectively done is to make the argument, both in rhetoric and in practice, that criticism, resistance or opposition to their rule amounts to terrorism\". His family accuses Rwanda of kidnapping him, saying they last heard from him in Dubai.\nUnited Arab Emirates officials have not commented on his arrest.\nRwandan investigators say Rusesabagina, who was played by United States actor Don Cheadle in the 2004 Oscar-nominated film \"Hotel Rwanda\", was arrested \"through global cooperation\" but have refused to elaborate.\n\nLoad-Date: September 5, 2020"
