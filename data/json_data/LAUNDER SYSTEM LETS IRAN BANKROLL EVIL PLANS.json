By changing or altering the numbers, the source of the money is obscured.\nThe money flows from Iran's banks to accounts maintained by that country's Islamic Revolutionary Guards and a special army unit to other bank accounts maintained by terrorist groups.\nThe groups have accounts under false names or front organizations in numerous countries, sources familiar with the probe said.\nThe groups include Hezbollah and Hamas in the West Bank, Gaza and Lebanon and the Taliban in Afghanistan, Treasury Department documents show.\n\"Hezbollah is an organization that has killed more Americans than any terrorist network except for Al Qaeda,\" Deputy Treasury Secretary Robert Kimmitt said in a speech last month.\nThe district attorney's office declined comment on the investigation.\nLast month, two multinational banks, Lloyd's and Barclays said they were asked to provide information to the district attorney and the Treasury and Justice departments on transactions involving countries under sanction. Both banks said they are cooperating with the probe.\nKimmitt said the Iran regime disguises its involvement in terrorism activities \"through an array of deceptive practices.\" On Thursday, a Paris-based banking watchdog group warned its 32 country members of Iran's \"deficiencies\" in controlling money laundering.\nThe Iranian banks laundering money for weapons acquisition include Bank Saderat, Bank Melli and Bank Mellat, the Office of Foreign Assets Control said.\nFor example, from 2002 to 2006, Bank Melli was used to send $100 million to Iran's special army unit, which used that bank's branches in the Middle East and Europe to transfer funds to Hezbollah and the Taliban, documents show.\nRocket-propelled grenades, plastic explosives and defense systems are among the weaponry provided to the Taliban and bought with transfers through the international banking system.\nIranian diplomats, business executives and businesses are also named in the OFAC's documents as participating in funding of terrorism and nuclear weapons acquisition.\nwsherman@nydailynews.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \nU.S. task force is probing how Iran, under president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, launders money to finance extremist Shiite militia operations (inset).
