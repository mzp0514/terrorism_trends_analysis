Searches were being conducted in at least three buildings.\nPolice originally told drivers in the area that the operation was an exercise. The rush-hour road closures caused traffic congestion across central Athens.\nU.S. Ambassador Charles Ries was notified of the police action by Public Order Minister Vyron Polydoras, the ministry said\nSecurity around the embassy building in central Athens has been heightened following a Jan. 12 attack on the embassy building with a rocket-propelled grenade that caused no injuries.\nA far-left Greek group, Revolutionary Struggle, later claimed responsibility for that attack, saying their action was in response to U.S. military involvement in Iraq, Afghanistan and Somalia.\nLast month, the Greek and U.S. governments offered separate million-dollar rewards for information leading to prosecution of members of that domestic group.\n\nLoad-Date: April 26, 2007"
