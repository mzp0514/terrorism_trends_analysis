Lake Shore Dr., and features interactive displays that delve into some of our most vexing questions: How big is the universe? How did it begin? Are we alone in it? The exhibit pairs with Adler's Grainger Sky Theater showing of \"Welcome to the Universe\" to offer an experience the planetarium is billing as \"Summer of the Universe.\"\nMultimedia displays in the exhibit explain the formation of stars, planets and galaxies, and touch screens allow guests to investigate deep space.\n\"The Universe\" is presented in the Adler's newly renovated Pritzker Hall of Cosmology. For details on the exhibit and visiting the museum, check adlerplanetarium.org.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nAdler Planetarium \"The Universe: A Walk through Space and Time\" is a new interactive exhibit at Chicago's Adler Planetarium.\n\nLoad-Date: July 15, 2012"
