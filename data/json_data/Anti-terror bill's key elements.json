    "full text": "The Senate bill to combat terrorism would:\n-- Make international terrorism a federal crime.\n-- Enable federal authorities to more easily deport suspect aliens.\n-- Sharply restrict the right of death-row inmates to appeal their sentences to federal courts.\n-- Enable federal authorities to use court-approved ''roving wiretaps'' to monitor phones suspected of being used by terrorists.\n-- Allow the U.S. military to assist civil authorities in emergencies involving chemical or biological weapons of mass destruction.\n-- Permit the State Department to summarily deny entry visas to persons associated with groups suspected of terrorism or to citizens of countries suspected of sponsoring terrorism.\n-- Add as many as 1,000 federal agents to investigate suspected terrorists and set up a new FBI counter-terrorism office.\n-- Empower the president to identify specific foreign groups as terrorist and ban U.S. citizens from collecting money for or contributing to such groups.\n-- Give federal agents greater access to financial records, credit card data, phone logs and hotel stays of suspected terrorists.\n-- Increase the statute of limitations for federal gun crimes to five years from three for such offenses as bomb-making, possessing sawed-off shotguns and converting firearms from semiautomatic to fully automatic.\n-- Authorize as much as $ 10 million in rewards for information leading to discovery and conviction of terrorists.\n-- Increase various penalties for conviction of terrorist crimes.\nCorrection\n\nManufacturers of gunpowder will not be required to add chemical tracers, called ''taggants,'' to their product. A story by the Knight-Ridder News Service in yesterday's editions incorrectly stated that the Senate bill to combat terrorism would require addition of the tracers.\n\nLoad-Date: June 9, 1995"
