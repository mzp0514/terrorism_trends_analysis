    "full text": "A Muslim police officer teased by co-workers about terrorism after the World Trade Center bombing was last seen in late June threatening suicide. His body was found Friday.\nInvestigators believe the officer, Mahamoud Tamer, killed himself with his service weapon, said a Transit Police spokesman, Al O'Leary.  Tamer's body was found on a rocky ledge below the Montauk Point lighthouse on the eastern tip of New York's Long Island. His badge and gun were found nearby.  Tamer, 26, was last seen wandering along subway tracks June 28 after failing to show up for work. He told a fellow officer who approached him he wanted to quit the force and kill himself, then fled.  The Transit Authority Police Department, which patrols New York's subways, was investigating whether other officers had harassed Tamer, who was of Lebanese descent, with jokes linking him to the Trade Center bombing.  Muslim extremists were charged in the bombing Feb. 26, which killed six people and injured about 1,000.  Co-workers are alleged to have taunted Tamer about his Muslim contacts, New York Newsday reported.  He apparently worshiped at the mosque of Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, Newsday sources claimed.  Tamer never formally complained about harassment, O'Leary said.\n\nLoad-Date: October 11, 1993"
