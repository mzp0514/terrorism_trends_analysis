Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland, said accelerated globalization increases cyber risk exposures along companies' supply chains. \"Cyber supply chain risk management is an emerging discipline\" in response to that, he said.\nJim Halpert, a partner at the DLA Piper law firm in Washington, said it's important that boards get involved in companies' cyber risk management efforts, seeking reports from senior management on risks, actual cyber attacks and the companies' risk management plans, as well as whether the company is properly managing cyber exposures.\n\"This is not an IT issue,\" Mr. Halpert said, adding that boards must focus on addressing cyber risks enterprisewide.\nAnd Mr. Halpert stressed the importance of training employees on cyber risks and how to minimize exposures.\nJon Iadonisi, co-founder and CEO of White Canvas Group in Arlington, Virginia also emphasized the value of training in the cyber risk management effort. \"When people learn to drive, you reduce the risks of accidents through training,\" he said.\nVendor management is another important element of cyber risk management, said Mr. Halpert.\nTom Kellermann, Irving, Texas-based chief cyber security officer at Trend Micro Inc., noted, for example, that mobile application developers rarely vet their apps for security. \"So there is your gaping hole,\" he said.\nIt's important to hire the right people to test the security of those apps, said Mr. Halpert. \"You don't want to have the wrong company test your mobile apps,\" he said, adding that addressing the cyber issues resulting from poorly tested apps could be far more costly than paying for the right company to test the app to begin with.\nMr. Clinton said that while some worry about the threat of cyber terrorism and there are some \"troubling scenarios\" of potential cyber-based terrorist attacks, national security analysis suggests those sorts of attacks are unlikely, so concern of a major cyber terrorism event \"is a misguided notion.\"\n\"The terrorism model is not the appropriate model for us to analyze cyber security, and the more we use the terrorism model the less effective it's going to be,\" he said. \"Instead we need to look at the modern cyber threat.\"\nThat threat, Mr. Clinton said, is attacks launched by criminals rather than terrorists. Ninety-five percent of these attacks are financially motivated, he said.\nJudy Greenwald contributed to this report.\n\nLoad-Date: May 29, 2014"
