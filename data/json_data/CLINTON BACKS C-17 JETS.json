    "full text": "President Clinton yesterday urged Congress to approve funds for all six McDonnell Douglas C-17 cargo jets requested by the Pentagon for 1995, rather than the four approved by a House of Representatives Committee. ''The C-17's capabilities are crucial to the Air Force's ability to deliver and sustain forces in support of theater commanders,'' Clinton said.\nTERRORISTS TO GET LIFE\nFour Muslim fundamentalists face up to life in prison without parole when they are sentenced today for bombing the World Trade Center. In a sentencing memorandum to the judge that was made public yesterday, prosecutors asked ''that each defendant is imprisoned for the rest of his life'' for the Feb. 26, 1993, attack that killed six people and injured 1,000. Another trial is scheduled to begin in September for 15 men charged with planning a series of terrorism attacks in the United States.\n \nBODY FOUND IN WRECK\nEmergency workers yesterday finished transferring a hazardous chemical from a derailed railroad tanker into a replacement tanker, and found the body of a truck driver killed in the accident. Thirty-five cars of a 101-car CSX freight train derailed after the train hit a tractor-trailer rig crossing the tracks Saturday. One car leaked phenol, used in resins and epoxies, which spilled into a nearby creek and released toxic fumes. Workers pumped an estimated 6,000 gallons of phenol from the tanker overnight.\n\nLoad-Date: September 15, 1994"
