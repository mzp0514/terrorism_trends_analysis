    "full text": "LONDON — Terrorism struck at the heart of London, police said early today, after a vehicle veered off the road and mowed down pedestrians on London Bridge and gunshots rang out amid reports of knife attacks at nearby Borough Market. \nThe violence turned a summery Saturday night in an area packed with bars and restaurants into a scene of panic and chaos, with officers running through crowded streets screaming for people to flee and lifeboats drafted to help clear the area. \nPolice said multiple casualties were reported, and British media reported that more than one person had been killed in the rampage. \nPrime Minister Theresa May said it was a potential act of terrorism, and the Metropolitan Police force said it declared the attacks \"terrorist incidents.\" \nPresident Donald Trump argued in favor of his controversial travel ban as London authorities responded to the attacks. \nTrump began tweeting about the incidents an hour or so after initial news reports. First, he retweeted a Drudge Report item about the attacks, then provided his own message about the travel ban. \nPolice said they were called just after 10 p.m. London time to reports of a vehicle hitting pedestrians on the bridge, which crosses the River Thames in central London. \nSoon after, there were reported stabbings at nearby Borough Market, an area full of bars and restaurants. \nThe force said armed officers were sent to the scenes and shots were fired. They did not say if officers fired the shots. \nThe force initially said officers also were responding to a reported third incident, in the Vauxhall area of London. But they said later that turned out to be an unrelated stabbing. \nMay said that \"following updates from police and security officials, I can confirm that the terrible incident in London is being treated as a potential act of terrorism.\" \nShe said it was a fast-moving investigation and her thoughts were with \"those who are caught up in these dreadful events.\" \nMay's office said she would chair a meeting of the government's COBRA emergency committee today. \nAbout two hours after the first reports of an incident, television images showed people walking away from the London Bridge area with their hands on their heads. Police tweeted that Londoners should \"remain calm but be alert and vigilant.\" \nNick Brandon of British Transport Police said the force had received reports of \"multiple\" casualties. He said he did not know how serious the injuries were. \nMultiple witnesses reported a vehicle veering off the road and hitting several pedestrians; others also said they saw at least one man with a large knife. \nWitnesses reported seeing injured people on the ground on the bridge. One, Holly Jones, told the BBC a white van veered off the road and struck as many as six people. She said she saw at least four or five people on the ground. \nSoon after, reports came in of stabbings around Borough Market, just steps away from the bridge. \nA man who gave only his first name, Ben, told BBC radio that he \"saw a man in red with a large blade, at a guess 10 inches long, stabbing a man, about three times\" near Borough Market. \nOther witnesses reported seeing as many as three attackers with knives. \nGerard Vowls, 47, told The Guardian newspaper that he saw a woman being stabbed by three men at the south end of London Bridge. He said he threw chairs, glasses and bottles at the attackers in a bid to stop them. \n\"They kept coming to try to stab me; they were stabbing everyone. Evil, evil people,\" he told the newspaper. \"I want to know if this girl is still alive. I've been walking around for an hour and a half crying my eyes out. I don't know what to do.\" \nThe Sun newspaper, whose offices are beside London Bridge, reported hearing explosions about three hours after the attacks began. It said the blasts were believed to be controlled explosions carried out by police. \nAs thousands of people flooded from the area — many unable to get home with nearby subway stations shut — locals were quick to offer assistance. \nIf confirmed as terrorism, this will be the third attack to hit Britain in as many months. \nIn March, a British convert to Islam ran down people with a vehicle on Westminster Bridge, killing four, then stabbed a policeman to death outside Parliament. \nOn May 22, a British suicide bomber killed 22 people and injured dozens at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester. After that attack, Britain's official threat level from terrorism was raised to \"critical,\" meaning an attack may be imminent. Several days later it was lowered to \"severe,\" meaning an attack is highly likely. \nA charity concert for victims of the Manchester attack, featuring Grande and other stars, is due to be held today in the northwest English city. \n\nLoad-Date: July 15, 2021"
