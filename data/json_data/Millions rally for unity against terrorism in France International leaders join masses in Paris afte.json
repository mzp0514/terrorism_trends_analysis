Millions more marched around the country and the world to repudiate three days in which terrorists killed 17 people.\nAmid intense security and with throngs rivaling those that followed the liberation of Paris from the Nazis, the city became \"the capital of the world\" for a day.\nMore than 40 world leaders headed the somber procession - Israeli Prime Minister\nBenjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas; Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov - setting aside their differences with a common rallying cry: We stand together against barbarity, and we are all Charlie.\nAt least 1.2 million to 1.6 million people streamed slowly through the streets behind them and across France to mourn the victims of deadly attacks on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, a kosher supermarket and police officers - violence that tore deep into the nation's sense of security in a way some compared to Sept. 11 in the United States.\n\"Our entire country will rise up toward something better,\" French President Francois Hollande said.\nDetails of the attacks continued to emerge, including video detailing how the attacks were going to unfold. Gunman Amedy Coulibaly was linked to a new shooting, two days after he and the brothers behind the Charlie Hebdo massacre were killed in nearly simultaneous police raids.\nThe attacks tested France's proud commitment to its liberties, which authorities may now curtail to ensure greater security. Marchers recognized this as a watershed moment.\n\"It's a different world today,\" said Michel Thiebault, 70.\nGiant rallies were held throughout France and major cities around the world, including London, Madrid and New York - all attacked by al-Qaida-linked extremists - as well as Cairo, Sydney, Stockholm, Tokyo and elsewhere.\nFrance's Interior Ministry said 3.7 million marched throughout France, including between 1.2 million and 1.6 million in Paris.\n\"I hope that at the end of the day everyone is united. Everyone - Muslims, Jews, Christians, Buddhists,\" said marcher Zakaria Moumni. \"We are humans first of all, and nobody deserves to be murdered like that. Nobody.\"\nOn Republic Square, deafening applause rang out as the world leaders walked past amid tight security. Families of the victims, holding each other for support, marched in front along with the leaders and journalists working for the Charlie Hebdo newspaper.\n\"Je Suis Charlie\" - \"I Am Charlie\" read legions of posters and banners.\nAt an international conference in India, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the world stood with the people of France \"not just in anger and in outrage, but in solidarity and commitment to the cause of confronting extremism and in the cause that extremists fear so much and that has always united our countries: freedom.\"\nThe three days of terror began Wednesday when brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi stormed the Charlie Hebdo newsroom, killing 12 people, including two police officers. Al-Qaida's branch in Yemen said it directed the attack to avenge the honor of the Prophet Muhammad, a frequent target of the weekly's barbs.\nOn Thursday, police confirmed, Coulibaly killed a policewoman. The next day, he seized hostages at the kosher market while the Kouachi brothers were holed up at a printing plant near Charles de Gaulle airport. It ended at dusk Friday with raids that left all three gunmen dead. Four hostages at the market were also killed.\nCoulibaly's widow, last seen near the Turkish-Syrian border, is still being sought.\nFrance remains on high alert while investigators determine whether the attackers were part of a larger extremist network.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n A woman holds a pencil and her mobile phone showing four victims killed in Friday's attack on the kosher supermarket in Paris, during a rally in Tel Aviv, Israel, Sunday, Jan. 11, 2015.
