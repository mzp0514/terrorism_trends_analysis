    "full text": "WASHINGTON -- Three months after President Barack Obama ordered a high-level review of U.S. aid to Egypt following a military takeover there, the White House settled on a middle ground Wednesday: maintaining key assistance for security and counter-terrorism efforts while suspending delivery of tanks, helicopters and other new military hardware.\nThe decision seeks to rebuke the Egyptian military for its ever-expanding crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood movement, but also to maintain what Mr. Obama has called \"a constructive relationship\" with a historically crucial Arab ally.\nU.S. officials announced that they would withhold delivery of \"big-ticket\" military systems worth hundreds of millions of dollars, including F-16 fighter jets, M1A1 Abrams tanks, Harpoon missiles and Apache helicopters. They also said they would suspend $260 million in direct cash assistance to the Egyptian government.\nThe administration said it would continue funding for counter-terrorism, border security and security operations in the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip, which are key to Israel, and would still provide spare parts for Egypt's large roster of U.S.-made tanks, warplanes and missile systems.\nIn a briefing for reporters, U.S. officials said they wanted to send \"a pretty clear message\" to the Egyptian military to end the violent clampdown and restore democratic institutions.\nBut illustrating the difficult balance the White House is seeking to strike, officials emphasized that core U.S. security interests in the region, including the Egypt-Israeli peace treaty, would not be jeopardized by the cuts.\nThe fate of U.S. assistance to Egypt -- a $1.55 billion annual package widely viewed as a linchpin of stability in the Middle East -- has been one of the most vexing questions for the Obama administration since July, when the Egyptian army deposed the democratically elected president, Mohammed Morsi; forcibly broke up pro-Morsi protest camps; and jailed as many as 2,000 of his supporters in the Muslim Brotherhood.\nThe counter-terrorism programs are at the core of the U.S.-Egyptian military relationship, and Pentagon officials have called upon Egypt's generals for years to modernize their force and improve border surveillance.\nSenior Israeli officials have urged the Obama administration not to cut aid substantially for fear of weakening the Egyptian military, which has honored the 1979 peace treaty with Israel, or pushing it closer to Persian Gulf governments that have pledged billions in aid since Mr. Morsi's ouster.\nBut U.S. officials have been dismayed by the generals' continued crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood. On Sunday, as the nation marked a major military holiday, security forces fired live ammunition at Brotherhood marchers, leaving 57 people dead, according to the government's tally.\nDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke with his Egyptian counterpart, Defense Minister Gen. Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, for 40 minutes Wednesday to explain the decision. Officials said the aid could be restored once the Obama administration was satisfied that Egypt was taking steps back toward democratic rule.\nEarlier Wednesday, Egyptian officials announced that Mr. Morsi would stand trial next month on charges of inciting the killing of opponents, which his supporters have denied.\nAfter Mr. Morsi was overthrown July 3, the administration announced that it would delay delivery of four F-16 fighter jets, and it canceled a mostly ceremonial joint exercise between the U.S. and Egyptian militaries. But Mr. Obama refused to label Mr. Morsi's ouster a coup, a legal distinction that would have triggered an automatic cutoff of U.S. aid to the Egyptian government.\nAnalysts said suspending delivery of additional warplanes and tanks would represent a slap on the wrist to the Egyptian generals and probably wouldn't change their political calculus.\nMr. Morsi, who has been held incommunicado in military detention, is to stand trial Nov. 4, and 14 senior Brotherhood leaders are to be tried with him, according to court documents.\n\nLoad-Date: October 11, 2013"
