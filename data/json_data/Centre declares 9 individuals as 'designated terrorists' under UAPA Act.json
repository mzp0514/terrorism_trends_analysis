Prior to this amendment, only organizations could be designated as terrorist organizations. \nShah during the debate in Parliament last year on the amendment to the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, had strongly had unequivocally reaffirmed the nation's resolve on this matter. By invoking the said amended provision, in September 2019, the Central Government designated four individuals as terrorists, viz. Maulana Masood Azhar, Hafeez Saeed, Zaki-ur-RehmanLakhvi, and Dawood Ibrahim. \n\"These individuals are involved in various acts of terrorism from across the border and from foreign soil. They have been relentless in their nefarious efforts of destabilizing the country, by trying to revive militancy in Punjab through their anti-national activities and through their support to and involvement in the Khalistan Movement\", the Home Ministry said in a statement. \n\nLoad-Date: July 2, 2020"
