We made important progresswith theTask Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing, but there is so much more work left to do. I am committed to working with my colleagues in both partiestoget money out of the hands of terrorists and find solutions that protectAmerica's safety and security.\"\nLast Congress, the House of Representatives passed Sinema'sNational Strategy for Combating Terrorist, Underground, and Other Illicit Financing Act. This bipartisan legislation directs the Secretary of the Treasury, in coordination with other federal agencies, to establish a comprehensive strategy to combat the financing of terrorism and related forms of illicit finance.\n###\n\nLoad-Date: February 7, 2017"
