    "full text": "A terrorism task force is investigating a report that a Colombian rebel group is plotting to kidnap former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in Mexico City, the Daily News reported Saturday.\nThe threat was described as a discussion about \"what they would get\" in terms of ransom for the former mayor, whose consulting firm has been hired to advise Mexico City police, the News quoted an unidentified source as saying.\nA retired New York City police detective heard of the plans by Colombia's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, while visiting Mexico on assignment for Giuliani, the newspaper said, quoting a law enforcement source who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nGiuliani spokeswoman Sunny Mindel said Saturday that Giuliani never discusses security. Police Sgt. Kevin Hayes said the department would not comment on the report.\nAuthorities told the News that the FBI-NYPD Joint Terrorist Task Force is taking the threat seriously.\nGiuliani and his firm, Giuliani Partners, were hired in October to help lower Mexico City's infamously high violent crime rate. Mindel said Giuliani is still working out the details of a planned trip to the city.\nSince he left office last year, Giuliani has been protected by a New York City police security detail.\nPolice Commissioner Ray Kelly said Wednesday that the taxpayer-funded protection is justified.\n\"We think that there are security concerns that have arisen as a result of his public employment sufficient to warrant a protective detail,\" Kelly said.\n\nLoad-Date: December 8, 2002"
