These new guidelines undercut the Federal Privacy Act, he said.\n \"The fact that this data can be retained for five years on U.S. citizens for whom there's no evidence of criminal conduct is very disturbing,\" Rotenberg said.\n \"Total Information Awareness appears to be reconstructing itself,\" Rotenberg said, referring to the Defense Department's post-9/11 data-mining research program that was killed in 2003 because of privacy concerns.\n The Obama administration said the new rules come with strong safeguards for privacy and civil liberties as well. Before the NCTC may obtain data held by another government agency, there is a high-level review to assure that the data \"is likely to contain significant terrorism information,\" Alexander Joel, the civil liberties protection officer at national intelligence directorate, said in a news release Thursday.\n\nLoad-Date: March 28, 2012"
