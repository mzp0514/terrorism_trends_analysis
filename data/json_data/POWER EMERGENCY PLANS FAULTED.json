The key components of one substation could be knocked out with just a rifle, thereby leaving an important military installation without power.\nAlthough the agency did not say it would be possible to defend electric installations against attack, it criticized efforts that have been made to cope with emergencies and to restore power.\n''Federal plans and programs for managing electrical emergencies which may arise from war, sabotage or terrorism are inadequate or nonexistent,'' it asserted. ''Further, Federal guidance and coordination with respect to such electrical emergency preparedness is lacking.''\n \nPriorities Are Suggested\nAmong its recommendations for better planning, the G.A.O. said the Department of Energy should establish priorities for different electricity users so that the most important customers such as military installations, industrial plants and hospitals could be the last to lose power or the first to have it restored in an emergency.  The agency also said the Energy Department should consider the need to stockpile key equipment so that such structures as substations and transmission towers could be replaced more quickly. A small substation normally takes three to six months to build, it said."
