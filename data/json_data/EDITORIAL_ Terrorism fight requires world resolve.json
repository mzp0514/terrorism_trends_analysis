That move, experts say, allowed ISIS to grow in power.\nWe cannot make another such move here by allowing a single error in judgment -- either by the Russian pilots violating the Turkish airspace or by the Turkish pilots who shot the Russian down.\nThe threat by Islamic fundamentalist terror groups is bigger than any single country. The terrorists are a global problem that will require concerted, and ruthless resolve to vanquish.\n___ (c)2015 The Natchez Democrat (Natchez, Miss.)
