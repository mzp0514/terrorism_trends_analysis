What is to prevent letters, lies and innuendoes from being sent to the authorities accusing us of being illegal enemy combatants and a danger to the country? \n  What redress would we have? I tell myself that this could never happen here, but I fear we are on a very slippery slope.\n\nMabel J. Dudeney\nNorwalk, Conn., Sept. 28, 2006\n\nTo the Editor:\n  Terrorism poses a grave and different kind of threat to the Republic. Yet it is no more grave than, say, Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union. \n  No one has explained how it is different in ways that justify condoning torture, rewriting international law, discarding principles of due process and human decency, ceding judicial authority to the president, and putting our troops and reputation in further jeopardy. \n  The president's pre-election antiterrorism legislation will do these things. It is a measure of cravenness that members of both parties would vote for this bill for political expediency.\n\nChristopher J. Mugel\nRichmond, Va., Sept. 28, 2006\n\nTo the Editor:\n  ''Rushing Off a Cliff'' is off the mark. I say that those who try to tear down our rights do not deserve to have their rights protected by us. \n  But you say otherwise -- that we must use judicious restraint and care to fight an enemy who is willing to fight without restraint and to win at all cost. \n  I don't think we can win fighting that way. In trying to vigorously protect our enemy's rights, we will surely lose ours.\n\nBill Decker\nSan Diego, Sept. 28, 2006\n\nTo the Editor:\n  We have reached the point where we must demand that the president uphold the Constitution. \n  In the past, when a politician rose to the highest office in the land, it was taken for granted that he would put the nation first. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case. \n  Unless we act and demand that our elected representatives act in our behalf, we will have an executive with unlimited power.\n\nBob Geary\nPortland, Ore., Sept. 28, 2006\n\nTo the Editor:\n  The day the detainee bill is signed will be a day that will live in dishonor in our history. The practices that appalled us in the past when used by sleazy regimes will be incorporated into our legal heritage. \n  If we do not reject the responsible party in power, we will indict ourselves as accomplices before decent world opinion.\n\n(Rev.) Connell J. Maguire\nRiviera Beach, Fla., Sept. 28, 2006\n\nThe writer is a retired Navy captain.\n\nTo the Editor:\n  You say that the ''Bush administration uses Republicans' fear of losing their majority to push through ghastly ideas about antiterrorism that will make American troops less safe and do lasting damage to our 217-year-old nation of laws.'' This is correct, but incomplete. \n  This administration seeks to strike fear in the hearts of all Americans so it can maintain total control. It uses the issue of security to create insecurity, while Democrats remain silent. \n  In 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt said that ''the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.'' The contrast is striking with today, when we seem to fear everything and reward the political opportunists who thrive on it. \n\nMorris Roth\nFort Lee, N.J., Sept. 28, 2006\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: September 29, 2006"
