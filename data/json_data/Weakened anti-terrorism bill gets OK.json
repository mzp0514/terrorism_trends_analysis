    "full text": "A watered-down bill to combat terrorism passed the House on Thursday by a 229-191 vote after two days of debate over the balance between protecting public safety and preserving civil liberties.\nIt took a last-minute plea by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., to give the measure the final push it needed to pass.\n\"The challenge of a free society is to have a government that is strong enough to protect us from danger but carefully enough constrained to itself not be a danger,\" Gingrich said.\nHe sought to calm concern that federal authorities might turn their sights on domestic militias and other groups that regard the government as the enemy.\nBefore passing the bill, which must go to a conference with the Senate, the House stripped away several provisions that would have beefed up the federal government's power to crack down on domestic and foreign terrorists.\nMany were afraid to give more power to the FBI, Treasury agents, immigration police and other federal authorities, citing what they called abuses of power during the 1993 siege of a heavily armed religious cult in Waco, Texas, and a 1992 shootout at Ruby Ridge, Idaho.\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who resisted striking the tough anti-terrorist language from his bill, said after final passage the climate of respect in the country for federal law enforcement has worsened.\nThe 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City and the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York City had been cited by the bill's sponsors as reasons to strengthen the government's anti-terrorist powers.\n\nLoad-Date: March 17, 1996"
