    "full text": "WASHINGTON -- The government detained at least 70 men, all but one a Muslim, as material witnesses and abused their civil rights in a largely secret operation launched by the Justice Department after the Sept. 11 attacks, Human Rights Watch and the ACLU allege in a report out today.\nThe civil rights groups say that in many cases the detainees were not told why they were arrested and did not get immediate access to lawyers, and that the Justice Department often would not confirm whether they were being held.\nFederal law allows the government to temporarily detain people who are suspected of having knowledge of a crime to ensure they testify. But the report accuses the government of operating in \"a Kafkaesque world of indefinite detention\" for many people who were never linked to terrorism.\nOf the 70 men identified in the report, 42 were released without any charges filed. Seven were charged with terrorism-related offenses. At least 13 received apologies from the government for being wrongfully detained, says the report, which relies heavily on interviews with witnesses, their lawyers and available court records.\n\"Muslim men were arrested for little more than attending the same mosque as a Sept. 11 hijacker or owning a box-cutter,\" it says.\nJustice Department spokesman Kevin Madden said that the department has not seen the report and that he would not comment on its identification of the witnesses.\nMadden referred instead to congressional testimony of Chuck Rosenberg, chief of staff to Deputy Attorney General Jim Comey.\nRosenberg said last month in written testimony that a judge approved every arrest. Under the law, judges are to supervise detentions, and prosecutors must give biweekly reports to support continued detention.\nHowever, Jamie Fellner, director of Human Rights Watch's U.S. Program, says judges failed to aggressively question prosecutors about the need for detention.\nThe report gives one of the most exhaustive reviews of the use of the material-witness law in domestic terrorism investigations.\nAmong the witnesses the report identifies are Oregon lawyer Brandon Mayfield and Virginia physician Tajammul Bhatti.\nMayfield was detained for about two weeks in spring 2004 after train bombings in Madrid. He was released after the FBI acknowledged that it misidentified a fingerprint lifted at the bomb scene.\nBhatti was held for about a week in 2002. The report says that the government used evidence recovered during a secret search of his apartment to get a material-witness warrant. It says the evidence included a New York Times story on Bhatti's computer about a man suspected of exploring a \"dirty bomb\" attack. Bhatti was released without being charged.\n\nLoad-Date: June 27, 2005"
