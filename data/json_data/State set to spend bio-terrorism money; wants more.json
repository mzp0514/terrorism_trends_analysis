    "full text": "One year after Sept. 11, Michigan is preparing to divvy up the $31.2 million it has received to help prepare for future biological attacks.\nBut as health agencies, hospitals and others assess what they need to develop plans and the capacity to handle public-health threats, whether from biological attacks or infectious diseases like the West Nile virus, there's one piece of the federal funding that state and hospital officials know isn't enough.\nThat amount, $4.1 million received Aug. 30 from the federal Health Resources and Services Administration, targets bio-terrorism response by hospitals, clinics and emergency medical services.\n''The whole state has to be prepared,'' said Jacqueline Scott, director of the Michigan Office of Public Health Preparedness. But the funds ''will barely touch on the needs'' of Michigan hospitals, she said.\nScott hopes to receive an additional $38 million from the Health Resources and Services Administration next year, and she and others say this year's funding is just a start.\nThe state will use part of the initial money from the agency to assess the ability of hospitals, emergency-medical-service responders and other health care providers to respond to the threat of bio-terrorism and to determine needs.\n''This is bare bones, to start (a) foundation,'' said Laura Schmidt, senior manager of health care surveys for the Michigan Health & Hospital Association in Lansing.\nMichigan's $31.2 million in federal preparedness funds are among $1.1 billion doled out to states as part of President Bush's response to last year's terrorist attacks.\nThe state plans to spend $27.1 million toward upgrading state and local public-health networks in areas that span communication and emergency-response plans.\nThe money also will be used to hire regional epidemiologists, expand laboratories, train health care providers and plan sites and procedures for a stockpile of antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals.\nThe Michigan Department of Community Health will spend some of the money as local health departments submit proposals to improve operations, such as buying computers or improving communications.\nThe department also is developing formal bid requests to issue in the next two months for activities such as university or business-provided education and training.\nAn additional $4.1 million from the federal Health Resources and Services Administration includes money for needs assessment and collection of hospital data by Public Sector Consultants Inc. in Lansing.\nPublic Sector has a $49,500 contract to survey Michigan's 214 licensed hospitals and affiliated clinics and report the results, probably in November.\nEight regional medical-control authorities will each receive $325,000 to be dispersed to hospitals based on the needs and recommendations of regional advisory panels.\nThe hospital association's Schmidt said allocating the money by region spreads the initial assistance to small rural hospitals and to those in large metropolitan areas.\n''I think it's very equally distributed, and until we identify strengths and weaknesses, that's the best way to do it right now,'' she said. ''We have to work as a unit; we have to work as regional hospitals.\n''Emergency management and disaster preparedness is not about competition. It's about keeping people alive.''\nAmy Lane: (517) 371-5355, alane@crain.com  \n\nLoad-Date: September 10, 2002"
