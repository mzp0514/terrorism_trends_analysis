    "full text": "For more than a year, two Algerians living in Canada helped hatch a plan to blow up buildings or other targets in the United States, a new federal indictment alleges.\nAhmed Ressam and Abdelmajid Dahoumane conspired \"to destroy or damage structures, conveyances or other real or personal property within the United States,\" according to the nine-count indictment filed in federal court in Seattle on Thursday.\nRessam was already facing explosives charges. The latest indictment adds terrorism conspiracy allegations and adds details to what prosecutors have described as an international plot involving at least six Algerians or their associates.\nProsecutors say they forged documents, bought or made explosives, and sought large-scale destruction.\nThe indictment does not include specific targets or how investigators traced an alleged plot dating to 1998. A separate federal indictment in New York said the conspiracy began at least a year earlier.\nThere were several developments in the case Thursday. In New York, a third man involved in the case pleaded not guilty to supporting Ressam. And in Montreal, an Algerian facing U.S. terrorism charges was denied bail after police said he coordinated plans to smuggle explosives into the United States.\nPolice testified that Ressam had links to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Investigators have already indicated they are seeking any connection to suspected terrorists - including Osama bin Laden, the alleged mastermind of two U.S. embassy bombings in Africa in 1998 who has taken refuge in Afghanistan.\nRessam, 32, was arrested Dec. 14 at a Port Angeles, Wash., border crossing in a rental car that authorities said contained bomb-making materials. Experts have estimated the amount of explosives could have destroyed a large office building.\nDahoumane remains at large, accused of being Ressam's accomplice.\nAuthorities have said the two men shared a $36-per-night motel room in Vancouver, British Columbia, for nearly a month before Ressam's arrest. Ressam also had a one-night motel reservation near Seattle's Space Needle for Dec. 14, and a plane reservation to London from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, authorities say.\nAfter his arrest, Seattle canceled the New Year's Eve celebration at the Space Needle amid concerns over terrorism.\nAt least four other Algerian nationals and one woman married to an Algerian are being investigated. One of the men was to meet Ressam in Seattle, drive him where he needed to go, and give him money, police in Montreal said Thursday, but the plan went awry after Ressam's arrest.\nThat man, Abdel Ghani Meskini, 31, pleaded not guilty in New York on Thursday to charges of providing and concealing support for Ressam.\nSerge Haineault, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigator, testified in Montreal that Meskini was ordered to go to Seattle by Mokhtar Haouri, a 31-year-old Algerian national who faces the same U.S. charges as Meskini and remains in a Canadian jail pending a March hearing.\nThey are accused of conspiring to transfer fake or stolen U.S. immigration identity cards and passports of other countries, including Canada and France, as well as using fake credit, bank and charge cards over the last year to buy $1,000 or more worth of merchandise. Their indictment did not say what they are accused of buying.\nHaineault said Haouri also was a member of the Armed Islamic Group, known by its French acronym, GIA. Ressam also has been linked by investigators to the GIA, which has been fighting a guerrilla war against the military regime in Algeria and is accused of committing atrocities against civilians.\nAlso in Seattle on Thursday, Abdel Hakim Tizegha pleaded not guilty to immigration charges in U.S. District Court. The FBI reportedly gained key evidence on explosives smuggling from telephone conversations between Tizegha in Washington state and Meskini in New York.\nOthers linked to the plot include Lucia Garofalo, a Canadian woman married to an Algerian. She was arrested Dec. 19 as she tried to cross into the United States at Beecher Falls, Vt. She later was linked to Ressam and Meskini through telephone records.\nShe faces seven charges ranging from illegally transporting an alien into the United States to possessing a false passport.\nAnother Algerian man, Bouabide Chamchi, was arrested with Garofalo. He faces four counts, including possession of a false passport and making false statements to U.S. Customs. Both Garofalo and Chamchi have pleaded not guilty.\n\nLoad-Date: January 30, 2002"
