Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said on ABC's \"This Week With David Brinkley\" that if Iran was behind the bombing, \"we're going to have to get tough.\"\nAnd Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said that if the Dhahran bombing was state-sponsored, \"it's an act of war.\"\nWhite House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta said whoever is behind the bombing \"will be held accountable.\"\nSpeculation about Iran's involvement in the Dhahran attack came Friday from Defense Secretary William Perry, who told National Public Radio that Tehran was \"possibly\" behind it.\nBut on Saturday, the secretary toned down his comments, saying he was referring to Iranian statements about intending to target Americans.\nIran reacted angrily to Perry's remarks.\nIts foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, called on the U.N. to act against the \"potentially dangerous consequences of this irresponsible and threatening behavior of the Washington administration,\" according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency.\nVelayati's deputy, Javad Zarif, said on CNN's \"Late Edition\" that it has become \"a rather normal business\" to accuse Iran of terrorist attacks.\n\"Terrorists have a free ride because they believe that if after each incident all the fingers will be pointed at Iran … (they will have) a … breathing space … to escape justice,\" said Zarif.\n\nLoad-Date: August 6, 1996"
