Drake was restrained by two passengers --- a deputy sheriff from Reno, Nev., and a doctor --- who were sitting near the cockpit door, the FBI said.\nDrake told investigators in Atlanta he was running from people who were trying to kill him, the affidavit says.\nThe flight originated in Cape Town; the incident occurred over international waters. After Drake was subdued, the flight had no problem, landing at 8:30 a.m.\nDrake was charged with three counts of interfering with a flight crew, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years. U.S. Magistrate Janet King ordered Drake to be evaluated at the Federal Correctional Institute in Butner, N.C.\n\nLoad-Date: September 19, 2003"
