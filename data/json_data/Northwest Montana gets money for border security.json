Jon Tester's office, Flathead County and Kalispell are receiving $200,000. Lincoln County will get $150,000, while Lake and Glacier counties will each receive $100,000.\n\"Nothing is more important than keeping our borders secure and our communities safe,\" Tester said. \"These resources will boost local law enforcement's ability to stop dangerous drugs from coming through our ports and ensure there are no weak links along our border.\"\nTester, as ranking member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, secured Operation Stonegarden grants worth over $1.5 million to communities across Montana. It's an increase of 55 percent from the $1,058,250 that Montana got in 2017.\nThese grants are issued to local governments and federally recognized tribal governments to defend the country's borders from terrorism, intercept illegal drugs, and combat human trafficking.\nMontana law enforcement agencies use Operation Stonegarden grants to increase preparedness, coordination, and effectiveness along the state's 545-mile northern border.\nReporter Scott Shindledecker can be reached at (406) 758-4441 or sshindledecker@dailyinterlake.com\nPrint Article\n___ (c)2018 the Daily Inter Lake (Kalispell, Mont.)
