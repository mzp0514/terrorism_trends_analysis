Glen Hester.\nThe convenience store employees were able to correctly determine if an ID was falsified 72 percent of the time in a practice scenario. Undercover operations and seminars had been performed in the past to encourage alcoholic beverage licensees to ask for an ID each time a purchase was made.\n\"The main thing we have stressed is that identification is shown,\" Hester said. \"The main reason so many were violated last year is that they didn't ask.\"\nFebruary 27, 2003: Officials assess bridge's terrorism vulnerability\nStanding on the new Sidney Lanier Bridge on a foggy afternoon, a group of about 10 law enforcement, public safety and public health officials assessed the vulnerability of the bridge as a target for terrorism.\nThe lack of security on the bridge entrance and on the supports rising up from the water were among the potential liabilities discussed by the group, as well as the possible economic ramifications on Brunswick should an attack on the bridge occur.\nFortunately, all the talk of the potential bridge disasters was just an exercise to help public officials determine terrorist risk levels for specific sites.\nThe site risk assessment was part of a three-day training course for officials in southeast Georgia on threat and risk assessments for weapons of mass destruction.\n\"The bridge could be targeted by an environmental group, or a disgruntled construction worker,\" said Evelyn Sears, an affiliate of the Emergency Prepared Division of the Coastal Health District. \"We aren't necessarily talking about Al-Qaida here.\"\nTo see more of The Brunswick News or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.thebrunswicknews.com/.
