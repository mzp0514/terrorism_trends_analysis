The wounded included 10 Vietnamese tourists.\nEgypt has for years been battling an insurgency in North Sinai, which surged following the 2013 military ouster of president Mohamed Morsi.\nThe government says fighting Islamist militants is a priority as it works to restore stability after the years of turmoil that followed the \"Arab spring\" protests of 2011.\nEgypt's neighbours in the region condemned the attack and the British Ambassador to Cairo, Geoffrey Adams, said the United Kingdom stood \"with Egypt in the fight against terrorism\".\nHowever, this is the first attack to target foreign tourists in nearly two years.\n\nLoad-Date: December 29, 2018"
