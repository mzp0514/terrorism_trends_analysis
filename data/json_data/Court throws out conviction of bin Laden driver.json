    "full text": "WASHINGTON - A federal appeals court on Tuesday threw out the conviction of Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a former driver for Osama bin Laden who served a prison term for material support for terrorism.\nIn a 3-0 ruling, the appeals court said that material support for terrorism was not a war crime under international law at the time Hamdan engaged in the activity for which he was convicted.\nHamdan was sentenced to 51/2 years, given credit for time served and is back home in Yemen, reportedly working as a taxi driver.\n\"If the government wanted to charge Hamdan with aiding and abetting terrorism or some other war crime that was sufficiently rooted in the international law of war at the time of Hamdan's conduct, it should have done so,\" wrote Judge Brett Kavanaugh of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. All three judges on the case were appointed by Republican presidents.\nThe war crime for which Hamdan was convicted was specified in the Military Commissions Act of 2006.\n\"The government suggests that at the time of Hamdan's conduct from 1996 to 2001, material support for terrorism violated the law of war referenced\" in U.S. law, said Kavanaugh, but \"we conclude otherwise.\"\nTo date, the cases against seven Guantanamo Bay prisoners under the military commission system in place at Guantanamo Bay military base have involved material support for terrorism. In five of the cases, those charged pleaded guilty. Hamdan went to trial, as did Ali Hamza al-Bahlul, who helped al-Qaida produce propaganda and handled media relations for bin Laden. Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd said the department is reviewing the ruling.\n\nLoad-Date: October 19, 2012"
