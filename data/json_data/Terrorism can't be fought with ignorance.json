Emotions and tensions are running high because of the recent terrorist attacks and many Americans are having trouble dealing with the sheer enormity of the situation.\nOklahoma State U.\nAs America rushes off to fight a war against an enemy that has no single country, it is time to take a step back and attempt to place things into perspective.\nThat was one of the purposes of a panel discussion title \"Responding to Terrorism\" held in the Student Union Little Theater by The Friends of the Forms Tuesday night.\nThe discussion was an opportunity for everyone in attendance to gain other options to responding to terrorism and allowed them to ask questions concerning recent events. The discussion featured informed, educated and experienced panelists who could offer the public the best weapon against terrorism, another perspective.\nWhile there is no set way for the public to handle a terrorist attack, it is always best to be well-informed and have a better perspective than those who commit such terrible attacks. Expressing our own views and gaining more knowledge about the views of others may be the thing that many Americans need right now.\nAmerica will recover from the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, but it will take more than time and money to heal our wounds and our nation's wounds. The healing process will only be hindered by ignorance and blind hatred.\n(C) 2001 Daily O'Collegian via U-WIRE\n\nLoad-Date: September 26, 2001"
