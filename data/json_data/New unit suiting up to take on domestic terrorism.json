Col. Ken Baldowski, spokesman for the National Guard. \"Chemical and biological weapons are much easier to acquire and produce, and the threat is greater.\"\nIn response to the growing threat of domestic biological and chemical warfare, Congress has approved the development of full-time RAID teams across the United States, which will be funded both by federal and state government.\n\"There is no option, we must be prepared,\" said Congressman Johnny Isakson.\nThe 22-person team is set to begin full-time operations by Jan. 5 in preparation for any Y2K disasters, said Maj. Mario Morales, commander of the unit. Team members go through up to 1,021 hours of training in preparation for their positions, which include reconnaissance, physician's assistant, nurse, environmental scientist, security liaison and logistics and communications specialists.\n\nLoad-Date: September 9, 1999"
