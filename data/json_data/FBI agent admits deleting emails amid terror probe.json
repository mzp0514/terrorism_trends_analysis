    "full text": "NEW YORK - An FBI agent testified Thursday that she deleted potentially sensitive emails covering several months when she was helping spearhead an investigation of a terror suspect. Defense attorneys have sought to examine FBI emails to see if they reveal agents skirted interrogation rules in the case of Mohamed Ibrahim Ahmed, an Eritrean man charged in Manhattan federal court with supporting terrorism. Ahmed's lawyers have asked U.S. District Judge P. Kevin Castel to bar statements made by Ahmed while he was detained in Nigeria in 2009 before being turned over to U.S. authorities. The defendant is charged with receiving explosives training, buying an assault rifle and raising money for al-Shabaab, a Somalia extremist group. An ongoing suppression hearing in the case has provided insight into how U.S. authorities attempt a balancing act intended to both head off immediate terror threats in the field and preserve evidence for use later in civilian trials. FBI agent Jennifer Dent was a member of a so-called \"dirty\" team that did an initial intelligence-gathering interview of Ahmed without reading him his Miranda rights while he was still in Nigerian custody in December 2009. \"We were very concerned about plots and plans against the United States and national security,\" she said.\n\nLoad-Date: January 13, 2012"
