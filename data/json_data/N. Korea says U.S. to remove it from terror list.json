    "full text": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - North Korea said Monday the United States has decided to remove the communist nation from a list of terrorism-sponsoring states and lift sanctions, despite the chief U.S. envoy's insistence that the issue remains under discussion. \nAn agreement reached in February called for such measures in exchange for North Korea's shutting down its nuclear reactor, disclosing its nuclear programs and disabling its related facilities. \nIn a report carried by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said that Washington's decision to lift sanctions and remove the North from a terrorism list came in a weekend meeting with North Korean representatives in Geneva. In line with KCNA practice, the spokesman was not identified. \nThe move came after North Korea agreed to take \"practical measures to neutralize\" its existing nuclear facilities this year, the spokesman said. \nState Department spokeswoman Nancy Beck said she did not have confirmation of the KCNA report, and Christopher Hill, the chief American envoy, made it clear in his news conference in Geneva that the North Koreans still have work to do before the U.S. is ready to take the country off the terror list. \nNorth Korea was first added to the list for its alleged involvement in the 1987 bombing of a South Korean airliner that killed all 115 people aboard. North Korea is among five still on the list, along with Iran, Syria, Sudan and Cuba. \nBesides being subject to economic sanctions, North Korea also has been effectively blocked from obtaining low-interest loans from international lending agencies like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\n\nLoad-Date: September 4, 2007"
