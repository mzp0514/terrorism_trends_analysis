    "full text": "Thank you for the article ''PLO Offers New Ideas for Talks,'' March 24. The intifadah has compelled world public opinion to focus on the plight of the Palestinians.\nNo longer can the world deny the reality of Palestinian nationalism and the Palestinian people's desire for statehood.\nDispossessed and uprooted from their home, some 5 million Palestinians do not have a country that they can call their own. The Palestinian leadership at the PLO now recognizes the reality of Israel, rejects all forms of terrorism and violence, including state-sponsored terrorism and torture. But surely the Palestinians do have the legitimate right to resist occupation and military captivation with the means at their disposal. Throwing stones at an occupying army is neither crime nor terrorism. Long ago, Gandhi described the victims' right to force the political agenda on the occupiers as a moral right.\nThe Palestinian Liberation Organization, though shunned by the United States, has acquired the right to speak on behalf of all Palestinians. The opening of a dialogue between the US and the PLO is encouraging, since the US has a key role to play in formulating a permanent and lasting peace settlement in the Middle East. US-initiated peace efforts, insofar as the question of Palestine is concerned, must now go beyond the confines of the Camp David accords, because attempts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian dispute cannot succeed without involving the Palestinians and the PLO.\nTanweer Akram, Grinnell, Iowa\nLetters are welcome.
