    "full text": "According to a Washington Post-ABC News poll, those interviewed support the CIA's brutal interrogation methods by almost 2 to 1. When was it that we lost our way, and our soul, as a nation?\nThe Senate report just issued concluded that the program was far more brutal than previously acknowledged and that it damaged our security interests as well as our reputation. Many detainees were tortured before they were given a chance to answer questions. At least 26 of the 119 known prisoners were wrongfully detained, and two of them were even CIA informants. The investigation has proof from the CIA's own records that this descent into barbarism produced no critical intelligence, which in the final analysis is beside the point; torture is wrong whether or not it produced information.\nThis is terrorism's sick genius, to invite us in to their madness, and we accepted the invitation. And, like Machiavelli, Marx and Stalin, we were told the end would justify the means. It didn't.\nAs Americans, we routinely look at the horrors in the world and piously say \"never again,\" but if we are honest, this dissent into hell was a sobering reminder of how fragile our principles really are.\nSusan Christensen\nSalt Lake City\n\nLoad-Date: December 22, 2014"
