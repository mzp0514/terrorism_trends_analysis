McMurry had threatened to blow up the Indianola square, killing himself and responding officers, with explosives at his apartment.\nThe incident happened just a few blocks south of campus.\nMcMurry faced a jury trial Thursday with his lawyer, Zachary Priebe, launching a defense of diminished responsibility or insanity.\nIndianola authorities suggested McMurry had previously encountered law enforcement due to mental health issues at the time of the standoff.\nHe was also charged with harassment, but the charge was dropped early last week.\nMcMurry is scheduled to attend a sentencing hearing at 10 a.m. Sept. 20 at the Marion County Courthouse in Knoxville.\nORIGINAL STORY:\nAn Indianola man was taken into custody and charged early Wednesday morning after a standoff that lasted almost five hours on the square, just four blocks away from Simpson's campus.\nDes Moines television station KCCI reports 35-year-old Quinten McMurry barricaded himself around 7:30 p.m. Tuesday in an apartment at 105 1/2 South Howard Street, making threats about explosives.\nMcMurry has been charged with terrorism.\nThe initial call, police said, was for a welfare check.\nPolice blocked off entry points to the square and evacuated nearby businesses due to the threat, including the movie theater.\nPolice spoke with McMurry over the phone until around 12:15 a.m. Wednesday when he was apprehended.\nAbout 40 reinforcements from several departments assisted in the standoff, including the state's bomb squad and SWAT team.\nIndianola police Capt. Brian Sher said in a news conference that this wasn't the first encounter with McMurry, who was apparently upset about a recent custody arrangement.\nOnline records show McMurry was sentenced to two years probation in January for child endangerment causing bodily injury stemming from a Dec. 27, 2014, incident.\nThe same woman filed for domestic abuse against McMurry in 2011 and again in 2014. Her most recent protective order was due to expire in November.\nAfter his apprehension, McMurry was taken to the hospital.\nHe's being held at the Warren County Jail on $50,000 cash-only bail and faces charges of terrorism and first-degree harassment.\nCheck back with thesimpsonian.com for updates to this story.\n\nLoad-Date: January 7, 2017"
