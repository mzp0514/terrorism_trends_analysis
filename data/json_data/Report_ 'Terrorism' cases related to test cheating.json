    "full text": "New Jersey prosecutors say they handled 62 \"international terrorism\" indictments last year - but of those, all but two involved Middle Eastern students accused of paying impostors to take English tests for them, according to a newspaper analysis.\nNearly all of the accused students are free on bond. Nine have already been convicted, and most of those have been fined between $$ @250 and $$ @1,000 and sent back to their own countries, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Sunday. \n\"There is not one whit of evidence that connects any of these people to terrorism,\" said Lawrence S. Lustberg, who represents 25 Saudi students charged with hiring others to take their tests.\nBut Michael Drewniak, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Newark, said \"there are very reasonable factors behind the investigation that compelled us and the Department of Justice to look very closely at these individuals.\" Among prosecutors' concerns: Several students held pilot's licenses.\nThe cases were listed as international terrorism from the beginning, and prosecutors typically do not go back and change them, Drewniak said. He said there was no attempt to mislead anyone.\nThe exam, called Test of English as a Foreign Language, is an entrance requirement for foreign students at many U.S. colleges. It is administered by Educational Testing Service, a Princeton-based firm.\nETS suspected a number of Middle Eastern students had used stand-ins to take the exam months before Sept. 11, 2001. Afterward, the FBI and immigration authorities scoured the firm's records, and the indictments followed.\nOn a national level, the Justice Department was recently criticized for inflating its terrorism-conviction statistics.\nThe General Accounting Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog agency, reported on Feb. 19 that three-fourths of 174 convictions last year were incorrectly listed by the Justice Department as international terrorism. The 62 New Jersey cases - most of which had yet to go to trial - were not included in that review.\nNail Al-Juberi, a spokesman for Saudi Arabia's embassy in Washington, called that \"an issue of credibility.\"\n\"If you have someone who cheated on a test and there was no linkage to terrorism, let's not play the numbers game,\" Al-Juberi said. \"To label them as terrorists, I have a concern with that.\"\nOf the two New Jersey cases not related to ETS testing, one was the March 2002 indictment of Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh for kidnapping Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. Saeed was sentenced to death by a Pakistani court and probably will not be tried in the United States.\nIn the last case, a Middle Eastern man pleaded guilty to using a false visa. He was sentenced to time already served and turned over for possible deportation.\n\nLoad-Date: March 3, 2003"
