It will focus on evacuations and medical and mobile responses, and about 1,200 volunteers will take part.\nThe exercise will take place Mesa, Chandler, Gilbert, Queen Creek, Goodyear, Tempe and Scottsdale, the DPS said.\nTo see more of The Tribune, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.eastvalleytribune.com.
