    "full text": "MOSCOW -- Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld arrived here today for talks with senior Russian officials on missile defense, nuclear force reductions and the war on terrorism, calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a \"stalwart\" in that global conflict.\nRumsfeld said it remains to be seen how Putin's new cooperative relationship with Washington will affect strategic negotiations on missile defense and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.\nBut Rumsfeld, in remarks to reporters on his plane en route to Moscow, said Putin's immediate offer of assistance after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington established him as a leader willing to work \"with the West and the rest of the world to help deal with this terrible problem.\"\nRumsfeld's trip comes largely in anticipation of President Bush's summit meeting with Putin in the United States 10 days from now. U.S. and Russian officials say they are hopeful that the two leaders can announce a new strategic \"understanding\" that would allow the Pentagon to pursue extensive missile defense testing without scrapping the ABM accord.\nBut with two former Soviet republics bordering Afghanistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, now providing assistance to U.S. military forces bombing Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia, Rumsfeld expanded his trip to build relationships with allies in the war.\nHe is scheduled to travel to both former Soviet republics later today. Sunday, he heads to Pakistan, another key ally bordering Afghanistan, and then on to India. He is scheduled to return to Washington late Monday night.\nRegarding the ABM treaty, Rumsfeld said, \"I'm not suggesting we delay withdrawal from the treaty. All I have said publicly is what the president has said: We need to set the treaty aside and establish a new relationship between the United States and Russia. The president has said we will deploy missile defense. That can't be done with a treaty there that's an impediment.\"\nRumsfeld declined comment on the new strategic understanding now under discussion under which both nations would also agree to reduce the number of strategic warheads to between 1,750 and 2,250 each.\n\"There are all kinds of things that have been discussed at different levels by different people,\" Rumsfeld said. \"How it will end up, we won't know until the two presidents get together in Washington.\"\n\nLoad-Date: November 3, 2001"
