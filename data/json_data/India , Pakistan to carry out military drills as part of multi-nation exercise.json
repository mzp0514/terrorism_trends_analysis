Both the countries were admitted as full members of the bloc last year.India's membership was strongly pushed by Russia while Pakistan's entry into the grouping was backed by China. With expansion of the grouping, SCO now represents over 40 per cent of humanity and nearly 20 per cent of the global GDP.India feels that as an SCO member, it will be able to play a major role in addressing the threat of terrorism in the region.\nIt is also keen on deepening its security-related cooperation with the SCO and its Regional Anti-Terrorism Structure (RATS) which specifically deals with issues relating to security and defence.India has been holding military exercise with China. The two countries are likely to resume their bilateral military exercise in September. Last year the drill was suspended following a tense standoff between their troops in Doklam.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MetroVaartha English.
