    "full text": "WASHINGTON - U.S. officials say Pakistan has apparently tipped off militants at two more bomb-building factories in its tribal areas, giving the terrorism suspects time to flee, after U.S. intelligence shared the locations with the Pakistani government.\nThose officials believe Pakistan's insistence on seeking local tribal elders' permission before raiding the areas may have most directly contributed to the militants' flight, though they also suspect that low-level security officials may have tipped the militants off.\nU.S. officials have pushed for Pakistan to keep the location of such targets secret prior to the operations, but the Pakistanis say their troops cannot enter the lawless regions without giving the locals notice.\nAll officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss matters of intelligence.\nThe latest incidents bring to a total of four bomb-making sites that the U.S. has shared with Pakistan only to have the terrorist suspects flee before the Pakistani military arrived much later.\nThe U.S. officials explained Saturday how they carefully monitored the area with satellite and unmanned drones, to see what would happen, after sharing the information a third and fourth time, the officials said. In each case, they watched the militants depart within 24 hours, taking any weapons or bomb-making materials with them.\n\nLoad-Date: June 19, 2011"
