    "full text": "Police believe a blast in a Niles ComEd transmission tower shortly before midnight Friday was more likely an act of juvenile delinquency than of terrorism.\n\"We know it is not a terrorist situation.\nIt doesn't appear someone was trying to drop the tower,\" Niles Investigative Sgt. Sam Fucarino said. \"(It was) probably just kids.\"\nPolice throughout the suburbs and the nation were watching closely Friday night and Saturday to try to prevent acts of terrorism timed to attract attention during New Year's celebrations. This, however, was not one of those, they said.\nPolice are not sure exactly what kind of explosive device went off in the tower. But they do know the device could not have dismantled the tower, Fucarino said.\nPolice and investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms are still investigating.\nThe explosion bent back a piece of steel about 2 feet long near the base of the tower, causing minimal damage, ComEd spokeswoman Mollie West said.\nShe added that the tower is structurally sound. No power failures resulted from the blast, she said, although 4,400 ComEd customers in Skokie, Park Ridge, Morton Grove and Niles experienced a momentary blinking of their lights after the explosion.\n\nLoad-Date: February 25, 2000"
