    "full text": "KUWAIT CITY - The U.S. Embassy has warned American citizens in Kuwait of possible terrorist attacks, asking them to stay alert and to report suspicious activity to the diplomatic mission or Kuwaiti police.\n\"Terrorist actions may include bombings, hijackings, hostage taking, kidnappings and assassinations,\" said a public announcement posted Saturday on the embassy's Web site.\nAny Americans, either civilian or members of the U.S. military, were possible targets, it said.\nAbout 13,000 Americans live in Kuwait, a major ally of Washington since a U.S.-led coalition fought the Persian Gulf War in 1991 that liberated Kuwait from a seven-month Iraqi occupation under ex-leader Saddam Hussein.\nThe warning also said terrorists might strike at public transportation and residential areas, since security at official U.S. sites has been increased.\nKuwaiti Islamic terrorists, who disapprove of the U.S. military presence in their country, have since 2002 attacked American troops and civilians working for them, killing one U.S. Marine and one contractor.\nKuwait was the launch pad for the 2003 invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam's regime, and it is still a base for American and other coalition forces serving in Iraq. Around 10,000 U.S. troops are based here.\n\nLoad-Date: August 2, 2005"
