    "full text": "NEW YORK (AP) - The largest terrorism trial in U.S. history\nstarts in earnest this week with opening statements and a warning\nfrom the judge that religion is not on trial.\nProsecutors will try to show that Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman and 11\nother Muslims planned a \"war of urban terrorism\" in America that\ncould have killed thousands of people.\nProsecutors will argue they plotted to blow up the World Trade\nCenter, the United Nations, the FBI's New York headquarters, two\ntunnels and a bridge, and to kill Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak\nand other politicians and judges.\nAfter 13 lawyers deliver their opening statements beginning\ntoday, U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey will instruct the jury on\nseditious conspiracy, the rarely used Civil War-era charge used in\nthe case. The trial's magnitude can be measured both by the number\nof defendants and the scope of what they allegedly plotted as well as\nthe damage already wrought.\nMukasey told lawyers last week he would tell the jury the\ndefendants are not accused of trying to overthrow the U.S.\ngovernment, only of trying to wage a war against it. He also will\nadvise them that if someone breaks laws, \"the fact that it is\nundertaken in the name of religion is no defense whatsoever.\"\n\"There is no religion on trial here,\" the judge said in a\npreliminary draft of his jury instructions.\nLawyers for Abdel-Rahman, the 56-year-old blind cleric alleged\nto have headed the conspiracy, charge that he's being prosecuted for\nhis beliefs. If convicted, he could face life in prison.\n\nLoad-Date: February 3, 1995"
