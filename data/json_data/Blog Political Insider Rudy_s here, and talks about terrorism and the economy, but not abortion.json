(Turns out this fellow was Lawrence Schall, president of Oglethorpe. Our apologies for not recognizing him on sight.)\nHe also noted that Oglethorpe welcomed a president-to-be about 75 years ago this month. It was FDR.\nGiuliani walked in, got a standing ovation, and quickly stripped off both his jacket and his glasses. Only a few seconds passed before the former New York mayor mentioned the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\nHis most inflammatory statement yet came when he drew the difference between Republicans and Democrats.\n\"Republicans are much more willing to be on offense against terrorism,\" Giuliani said.\nFirst question for him was about the fair tax. Giuliani said the time wasn't right for it.\nHis second question came from an elderly woman who didn't like current approach to the war in Iraq, and thought it might be breeding more terrorists.\n\"I respectfully disagree,\" Giuliani said, and questioned whether the woman understood the problem.\nNo questions about abortion so far.\n\nLoad-Date: May 19, 2007"
