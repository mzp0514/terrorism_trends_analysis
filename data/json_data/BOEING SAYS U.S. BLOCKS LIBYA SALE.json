    "full text": "The Boeing Company said yesterday that the United States Government had turned down its request to sell Libya $600 million of commercial jet airliners. Russell G. Schley, a spokesman for the Seattle-based company, said Boeing had received notice earlier this week from the Commerce Department that the request had been denied.\nThe Boeing Company said yesterday that the United States Government had turned down its request to sell Libya $600 million of commercial jet airliners.\nThe company had hoped to sell one 747, five 767's and six 737's to Libya Arab Airlines, a state-owned carrier.  Mr. Schley said Boeing had sold 12 jetliners - one 707 and 11 727's - to Libya in the 1970's. Sales of aircraft that might be converted to military use have not been approved in recent years, however.\nTrade with the African country has been subject to various restrictions because of United States contentions that Libya has supported terrorism. Relations deterioriated further when President Reagan said last week that he had sent four Air Force Airborne Warning and Control System planes to Egypt when intelligence reports suggested Libyan designs on the Sudan.\nOf the lost sale, Mr. Schley said, ''There never was a firm order, only a proposal. So nothing was gained or lost.''"
