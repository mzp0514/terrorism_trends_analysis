The additional inspectors will allow Customs to question more people entering the United States at airports, seaports and road crossings, he said.\n\"We are applying additional resources to do additional contacts with the public coming through,\" Kelly said. \"It would mean more questioning, looking for perhaps questionable or suspicious activity, engaging in more conversation. That's basically how Customs inspectors work.\"\nSome 460 million people come into the United States each year though 301 points of entry.\n\"The message is that U.S. Customs Service â€¦ is ready and prepared,\" Kelly said.\nIn Maine, U.S. Border Patrol agents have been called back to work from leave, and others are working overtime as the agency increased staffing levels in response to Friday's arrest in Washington.  washington.\n\nLoad-Date: December 22, 1999"
