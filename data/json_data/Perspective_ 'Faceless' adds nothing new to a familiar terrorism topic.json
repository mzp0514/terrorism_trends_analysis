    "full text": "Let's set aside that this conversation always involves terrorism.\nThat the drama must always center on religious identity and its relationship to violence against the country. One religious identity in particular.\nAnd it's always on trial.\nFor \"Faceless,\" opening Friday at the Repertory Theatre of St. Louis, playwright Selina Fillinger chose to explore a familiar setting and a familiar narrative about Islam and Muslims in America. It's a story that feels weary to those who have lived with it their whole lives.\nTo her credit, Fillinger explores it through the eyes of two interesting female characters, both Muslim. One is a young, white, radicalized convert, the other a Harvard-educated, American Muslim lawyer. The latter is persecuting the former for alleged ties to terrorism.\nSomewhere in the process of being jailed and on trial, the defendant goes from being the committed fiance of a jihadist to a repentant young woman who realizes she has been duped. In the play's script, this transformation happens inelegantly. It may be a more nuanced portrayal in the hands of a skilled actor.\nUltimately, the play ends up reading much like an episode of \"Law & Order.\" It's well-paced and well-written but formulaic - and in the end, the writer pulls back. \"Law & Order\" wouldn't deny its audience that way.\nIt also leaves the premise in the work insultingly obvious: Yes, there are Muslim-Americans fighting terrorism in this country when it involves Muslim suspects, even when those suspects don't seem guilty of much more than being young, gullible and stupid. I kept waiting to see what comment Fillinger was going to make about this conflict.\nThis story was only willing to go as far as to suggest that it's complicated.\nWell, yes, but that's as predictable as another story about a Muslim terrorist on trial.\n> Aisha Sultan, who is a Muslim-American, writes about children and family issues for the Post-Dispatch.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n Lindsay Stock, (left), who plays a young American Muslim convert, rehearses a scene in \"Faceless\" on Friday, Jan. 12, 2018, with Ross Lehman for an upcoming production at the Loretto-Hilton Center for the Performing Arts. \"Faceless\" tells the story of play about a young American female convert to Islam who has been arrested for terrorism, and a Muslim-American female prosecutor seeking to convict her.
