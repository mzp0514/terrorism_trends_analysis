    "full text": "The House on Wednesday passed long-sought legislation to renew a government program that is credited with reviving the market for insurance against terrorist attacks after 9/11.\nBut the measure, despite passing by a 417-7 vote, has run into trouble in the Senate because of opposition to an unrelated item involving a rewrite of a provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank overhaul of financial services regulations and opposition to an obscure provision involving the licensing of insurance agents.\nThe terrorism risk insurance program originally was enacted in 2002 after the 9/11 attacks led to the collapse of the private market for terrorism insurance. It provides a government backstop for private insurance companies in the event of catastrophic losses.\nThe legislation is important to economic sectors such as construction, real estate, hospitality and major sports leagues, which fear crippling insurance costs should the government program expire and rates skyrocket.\nUnder the law, the government covers 85 percent of losses after the first $100 million in terrorism damage.\nDemocrats controlling the Senate are objecting to unrelated legislation that seeks to protect businesses that use financial instruments called derivatives to hedge risk from being subjected to costly margin requirements under Dodd-Frank regulations. Its inclusion could trip up the measure in the Senate, where any senator singlehandedly can block a bill.\n\nLoad-Date: December 11, 2014"
