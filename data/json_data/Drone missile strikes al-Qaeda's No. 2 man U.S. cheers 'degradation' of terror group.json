The Rewards for Justice program described al-Libi as using his \"religious training to influence people and legitimize the actions of al-Qaeda.\"\nIn a 2009 profile of al-Libi in Foreign Policy magazine, terrorism expert Jarret Brachman described al-Libi as \"media-savvy, ideologically extreme and masterful at justifying savage acts of terrorism with esoteric religious arguments.\"\nAl-Libi was one of thousands of men from around the Muslim and Arab world who flocked to Afghanistan in the 1980s to battle the Soviet Union. According to Brachman, he later went to Mauritania for advanced religious studies that he used in repeated videos and other al-Qaeda outreach designed to attract followers and justify terrorism.\nAl-Libi was influential and popular within al-Qaeda because of his \"scholarly credentials, street cred from having escaped from Bagram, charisma and his easygoing, tribal speaking style,\" said Brachman, who has studied al-Libi for the past seven years. \"People may have revered Zawahri, but they loved Abu Yahya,\" Brachman said.\nAl-Libi was the latest in the dozen-plus senior commanders removed in the U.S. war against al-Qaeda since Navy SEALs killed bin Laden in a raid on his compound in Pakistan. \n\nLoad-Date: June 6, 2012"
