    "full text": "The Jewish reaction to the massacre by a lone Israeli gunman in Hebron was instant and overwhelming. ''There is no understanding, no forgiveness, and no atonement for this horrible act,'' said the president of Israel. ''I am shamed over the disgrace imposed upon us by a degenerate murderer,'' said the prime minister. In synagogues throughout the world, congregation and clergy offered expressions of contrition and regret.\nEight years ago, Palestinian gunmen burst into the largest synagogue in Istanbul, barred the doors to prevent escape, then murdered 22 worshipers. In how many mosques throughout the Palestinian world were expressions of contrition and regret offered? And how did the Palestinian leadership react? PLO spokesman Salah Khalaf said this: ''We are against the murder of innocents, even if they are Jews.''\nFour Islamic and Palestinian groups claimed ''credit'' for the attack. Which was the norm. After bloody attacks on synagogues in Copenhagen, Antwerp and Rome, various Arab groups rushed forward to claim the honor.\nAt a time when the world stands still to judge Israel, one is not supposed to make such comparisons. It is considered bad form to point out the double standard by which Israelis and Palestinians are judged.\nConsider: On Feb. 18, Tsippora Sasson, 33 and five months pregnant, was driving home with her husband and two children, age 6 and 9. Palestinian gunmen waiting in ambush attacked the car. They shot her once in the head, once in the abdomen. Hours later, she died.\nThis murder occurred seven days before the Hebron massacre. In The Washington Post it merited five sentences on page A45. The New York Times gave it three.\nYet there was nothing prejudicial about these news judgments. Ever since the PLO's pledge to renounce terrorism was consecrated by the Handshake on the White House lawn, Palestinians have murdered an average of one Israeli civilian a week. When something happens every week, it goes on the back pages.\nSound news judgment. But news judgment is one thing, moral judgment another. And it is a perverse moral judgment that because acts of Palestinian murder are so common, they should escape condemnation, indeed notice.\nThere is no balancing one death against another, one massacre against another. There is no excusing any murder. That is precisely the reaction of Israel to the murderer in its midst. And it is precisely not the reaction of the Palestinians -- and of a self-righteous world -- to Palestinian murderers.\nMordechai Lapid and his 19-year-old son are shot by Palestinian gunmen. They bleed to death in the arms of a doctor named Baruch Goldstein. Such terrorism is routinely attributed to Palestinian rage or frustration. Or to the ''cycle of violence,'' as if this absurd geometrical analogy explains anything.\nOf course, it is not meant to explain. It is meant to excuse. But never Israelis. How appalled we would be -- we should be -- were a report on the Hebron massacre to begin with ''Baruch Goldstein, an Israeli religious fanatic, a doctor recently unhinged when a friend and his son murdered by Palestinians died in his arms, today opened fire â€¦ ''\nThe U.N. Security Council -- silent after synagogue attacks in Istanbul, Paris, Vienna, Antwerp, Copenhagen and Rome; mute at the murder of Sasson, the Lapids, and countless other Jews -- prepares itself to reprove Israel over Hebron. The double standard is scandalous, yet accepted as a matter of course.\nThe Hebron massacre was the work of one deranged fanatic. He represented at most the fringe of a fringe. Meir Kahane, leader of the Kach movement to which Goldstein belonged, competed four times in Israeli elections. The most he ever got was 1 percent of the vote. Yet even that was too much for Israel. In 1988, Kach was barred, because of its racism, from ever running for Parliament again.\nPalestinian terror is not the work of a fringe. It is mostly the work of Hamas, a Palestinian movement so popular that Arafat is wary of West Bank elections out of fear that Hamas would win. Nor, like Kach in Israel, is Hamas a pariah to the Palestinian mainstream. Four days after the PLO-Israel handshake in Washington, the PLO and Hamas negotiated a truce, consecrated in a ''Document of Honor.''\nThe partnership is cozy and convenient to both sides. The PLO does the negotiating, Hamas does the killing (with occasional free-lancing by Arafat's Fatah Hawks).\nThe PLO issued no apology for the murder of Tsippora Sasson. Hamas claimed credit. It distributed leaflets in Gaza pledging to ''turn every day into hell for the Israelis.'' Sasson's murder was not some random spasm but part of an open, ongoing strategy of terror.\nHamas generally kills in ones and twos. Goldstein's atrocity had greater scope. For that he will surely occupy a circle in hell even lower than that of the killers of Tsippora Sasson.\nBut the world is not content to judge Goldstein. It is judging Israel because of Goldstein. Yet what, in fact, is the moral difference between Israeli and Palestinian terrorism? For Israel, it is a matter of shame. For the Palestinians, it is a matter of policy.\n\nNotes\n\nCharles Krauthammer is a syndicated columnist for The Washington Post.\n\nLoad-Date: September 15, 1994"
