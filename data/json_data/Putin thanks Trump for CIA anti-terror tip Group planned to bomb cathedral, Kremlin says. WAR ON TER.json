The group reportedly planned weekend bombings. RUSSIAN FEDERAL SECURITY SERVICE\nMOSCOW - Russian President Vladimir Putin telephoned U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday to thank him for a CIA tip that helped thwart a series of bombings in St. Petersburg, the Kremlin and the White House said.\nDuring the call, the two leaders' second in three days, Putin expressed gratitude for the CIA information. The Kremlin said it led Russia's top domestic security agency to a group of suspects that planned to bomb St. Petersburg's Kazan Cathedral and other crowded sites this weekend.\n\"The information received from the CIA proved sufficient to find and detain the criminal suspects,\" the Kremlin said.\nThe White House said in its readout of the conversation that \"based on the information the United States provided, Russian authorities were able to capture the terrorists just prior to an attack that could have killed large numbers of people.\"\nThe White House added that Putin extended his thanks and congratulations to CIA Director Mike Pompeo and the entire agency. Trump then called Pompeo \"to congratulate him, his very talented people, and the entire intelligence community on a job well done!\"\n\"President Trump appreciated the call and told President Putin that he and the entire United States intelligence community were pleased to have helped save so many lives,\" the White House said in its statement. \"President Trump stressed the importance of intelligence cooperation to defeat terrorists wherever they may be. Both leaders agreed that this serves as an example of the positive things that can occur when our countries work together.\"\nThe Kremlin said Putin assured Trump that \"if the Russian intelligence agencies receive information about potential terror threats against the United States and its citizens, they will immediately hand it over to their U.S. counterparts via their communications channels.\"\nThe CIA's tip to Russia comes even as Russia-U.S. ties have plunged to their lowest level since the Cold War era - first over Russia's annexation of Crimea and support for pro-Russia separatists in Ukraine, more recently over allegations that Moscow interfered in the U.S. presidential election to help Trump.\nWhile Russian officials have said the two countries were continuing to exchange some terror-related intelligence, Sunday's statement from the Kremlin was Russia's first public assertion that information from the United States helped prevent an attack.\nThe conversation was the second between the Russian and U.S. presidents since Thursday, when Trump thanked Putin for his remarks \"acknowledging America's strong economic performance,\" according to the White House.\nDuring the first call, they also discussed during ways to work together to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic weapons program, the White House said.\nThe Federal Security Service, or FSB, announced Friday that seven suspected followers of the Islamic State group had been arrested for allegedly planning to carry out terror attacks in St. Petersburg this weekend.\nThe agency said the suspects were plotting a suicide bombing in a church and a series of other explosions in the city's busiest areas this coming weekend on IS orders. It said a search of a St. Petersburg apartment found explosives, automatic weapons and extremist literature.\nRussian news reports said that Kazan Cathedral, a landmark 19th century Russian Orthodox church on St. Petersburg's central Nevsky Prospect, was the prime target.\nIf the suspects succeeded in bombing the cathedral, it would have been the first major attack on a Russian Orthodox Church by Islamic terrorists, who have blown up apartment buildings, passenger planes and transport facilities in Russia.\n\nLoad-Date: December 18, 2017"
