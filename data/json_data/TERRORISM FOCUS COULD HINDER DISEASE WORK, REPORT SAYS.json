    "full text": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government's duty to protect the public from disease could take a back seat to terrorism preparation and response under President Bush's proposed Homeland Security Department, a House panel was told Tuesday.\nThe General Accounting Office, which is the investigative arm of Congress, said transferring some public health functions from the Health and Human Services Department to the new agency could undermine the basic effort to keep Americans healthy.\n\"Although HHS programs are important for homeland security, they are just as important to the day-to-day needs of public health agencies and hospitals, such as reporting on disease outbreaks,\" the GAO said in testimony to the House Energy and Commerce oversight subcommittee.\nBush's plan, the GAO added, \"does not clearly provide a structure that ensures that both goals\" can be met.\nThe president's homeland security point man, Tom Ridge, said in his own testimony before the panel that the GAO and many lawmakers had raised \"a very important issue,\" but that both functions would persist.\nIf HHS and the new agency disagreed about how to use people and resources for example, to respond to both an anthrax attack and a virulent new strain of influenza Ridge said the White House would step in.\n\"If there's a disagreement between Cabinet members â€¦ the ultimate tiebreaker is the president of the United States,\" Ridge told the House panel.\n\nLoad-Date: June 26, 2002"
