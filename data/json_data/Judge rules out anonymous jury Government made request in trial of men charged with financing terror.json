    "full text": "A federal judge on Wednesday rejected a government request for an anonymous jury at the upcoming trial of two men charged with helping to finance terrorism by the Palestinian militant group Hamas.\n\"The government has not presented evidence that either defendant has a history or likelihood of obstruction of justice or has previously attempted to interfere with the judicial process to the extent necessary to warrant empaneling an anonymous jury,\" Judge Amy J. St. Eve said.\nHer ruling came in the case of Muhammad Salah, 53, of suburban Bridgeview, and Abdelhaleem Ashqar, 48, of Alexandria, Va.\nProsecutors had asked for an anonymous jury, saying the two men were associated with Hamas, whose members might be able to intimidate or take reprisals against jurors.\nBut Salah's attorneys said the two defendants posed no danger to jurors and that the jury would be prejudiced against their clients if told that they might become targets merely by sitting in the case.\nSalah attorney Michael E. Deutsch said he was \"heartened by the court's ruling.\"\n\"It affirms that our clients are not dangerous and do not pose a threat to the judicial system and just because the government invokes the word 'terrorism' for their own political purposes it doesn't make this a terrorism case,\" Deutsch said in a telephone interview.\n\nLoad-Date: August 10, 2006"
