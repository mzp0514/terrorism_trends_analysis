    "full text": "Atlanta has been ranked in the Top 10 Most Liveable Cities in America by the 2018 Global Liveability Index.\nPublished each year by The Economist Intelligence Unit, The Global Liveability Index is a list of 140 cities around the globe that have been rated in terms of the relative comfort of their residents. The Economist Intelligence Unit measures liveability by using 30 qualitative and quantitative factors in five broad categories: healthcare, culture and environment, education, infrastructure, and stability (assessing crime, conflict, and terrorism).\nOnly 10 American cities made the top 50 list, with Atlanta ranking #10 among U.S. cities and #50 among 140 global cities. Atlanta's total liveability score for 2018 was 88.6.\nAlthough American cities have been declining in their liveability scores in recent years, overall scores improved in 2018. The Economist Intelligence Unit defines this improvement as the result of a decline in civil unrest. Comparing regions, North America ranked #1 in the education category and #2 across all categories.\nHere are the top 10 most liveable U.S. cities:\n1. Honolulu, Hawaii (ranked No. 23)\n2. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (ranked No. 32)\n3. Washington D.C. (ranked No. 37)\n4. Minneapolis, Minnesota (ranked No. 39)\n5. Boston, Massachusetts (ranked No. 42)\n6. Chicago, Illinois (ranked No. 44- tie)\n7. Miami, Florida (ranked No. 44- tie)\n8. Seattle, Washington (ranked No. 46)\n9. San Francisco, California (ranked No. 49)\n10. Atlanta, Georgia (ranked No. 50)\n\nLoad-Date: September 7, 2018"
