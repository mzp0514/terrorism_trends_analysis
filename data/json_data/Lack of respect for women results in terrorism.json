    "full text": "Women's rights are the ultimate weapon against terrorism.\nNo, I'm not crazy. I'm not trying to be funny, either. I'm completely serious, and I have some very good reasons to be serious.\nI can't help noticing that evil thrives on ignorance. The Taliban are not at all kind to women. They demand that women remain completely covered when walking the streets. Women also have to be accompanied by a male relative when they leave their house, and girls are not allowed to attend school.\nEmporia State U.\nMany women have become so distressed by the inhumanity they endure every day that Kabul's mental hospital was once overcrowded with female patients.\nThe Taliban are being blamed for harboring terrorists, namely Osama Bin Laden. Word has it that he has three or more wives.\nIt's interesting that the same authoritarian regime that is being blamed for attacks on the United States is also the same regime that is notorious for oppressing women.\nPeople argue that the Taliban have every right to treat women the way they do. It's not a violation of human rights, they say, but a tradition justified by religion, by God.\nA little more than a hundred years ago, Americans used to say the same thing about slavery.\nIf you pay attention to the news, you'll notice that all the hijackers who have been identified with the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon have been linked to Osama Bin Laden. All the hijackers are also male. Mohamed Atta, the most famous of the hijackers, spent many nights in the seediest part of Las Vegas, getting lap dances from strippers and cheap sex from teenage call girls. I seriously doubt he had any respect for women. Are these the kind of people who become martyrs for terrorists? No wonder they are demented.\nOther terrorists prominent in our own time: the Unabomber, a man who has had difficulty dealing with women since puberty; and Timothy McVeigh, the renowned Oklahoma City bomber who showed little remorse for killing women and children.\nWhy do I see a trend here? Why do I see subjugation, corruption or even elimination of women where terrorism or terrorists exist?\nCorrelation doesn't mean causation. If anything, I learned that in my psychology classes. But this is more than just a correlation. It has to be. The 1970s are often claimed as being the height of the women's movement here in America. Notice that many years of peace soon followed thereafter for this nation, as well as most of the world. With an increased tolerance of women's rights, there have been huge increases in quality of life, international relations, and, so far, there hasn't been another World War.\nMany factors, I'm sure, have contributed to lasting peace. But look at the situation now. Our enemy, our new war being waged, is against a people who oppress women through a misguided culture and religion.\nWhere women are given equal opportunities, there appears to be less violence, more peace.\nViolent crime is down at Emporia State. The female population at this university (a university with a female president) is also at its highest in years, two women for every male to be exact.\nThe United Nations, the global police force and negotiator, consists of some of the most economically and technologically advanced countries in the world: America, France and Britain.\nThey are also countries that have taken considerable efforts to improve women's rights.\nCorrelation or coincidence?\nIt doesn't always take Nostradamus to read the signs. Men who mistreat women, as if they are somehow lesser beings, appear to be at a greater risk of committing far greater evils, even terrorism. The quick answer to terrorism is to bomb the terrorists, use secret agents and special forces if necessary to get the enemy and destroy the enemy. The strategy is simple: Gas 'em, nuke 'em and shoot 'em.\nThe long-term solution is education and understanding. A society that realizes the mistakes it has made is less likely to repeat them. What better way to begin the education than with women's rights and freedom across the globe.\nAmerica has suffered. Somewhere out there women are still suffering. Let's end it and our war.\n(C) 2001 The Bulletin via U-WIRE\n\nLoad-Date: October 25, 2001"
