    "full text": "On the heels of the Obama administration's announcement that it wants to increase the number of refugees accepted into the U.S., an internal immigration memo released by members of Congress acknowledges that refugee fraud is \"easy to commit\" and \"not easy to investigate.\" \nSo much for the \"robust vetting\" promised by Team Obama. \nAccording to the department memo, America's gatekeepers have relaxed requirements that refugees from regions mired in terrorism prove who they say they are, The Washington Times reports. Sometimes officials rely on nothing more substantial than the individual's testimony. \nSo, naturally, there are occasions in which \"bad actors \"¦ have exploited this program,\" the memo says. And this, when the administration has announced plans to accept up to 110,000 refugees next year and will resettle as many as 30,000 Syrians in 2017. \nThese revelations follow last week's news from Homeland Security's inspector general that well more than 800 illegal immigrants from terrorism hotbeds \"” and facing deportation \"” were instead granted citizenship. Follow-up reports suggest that number is much larger. \nWhat's revealed is a refugee-resettlement program that's \"creating national security risks,\" write Reps. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and Bob Goodlatte, R-Va. Given what Homeland Security says, and what it actually does, an independent investigation of the department is within reason to restore America's sense of security. \n\nLoad-Date: September 27, 2016"
