Green Beret and Delta Force operatives on horseback call in airstrike coordinates \"in the first cavalry charge of the 21st century.\"\nThe United States must rebuild its network of human spies \"the people who find the targets, follow our enemies and help us disrupt their evil plans\" and invest in more sophisticated weapon systems like the unmanned, missile-armed Predator surveillance plane.\nBehind the scenes, National Security Council spokesman Sean McCormack told reporters \"the time is coming\" for the United States to get past the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty that bans any missile defenses. He did not say whether this meant breaking or withdrawing from the treaty.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nAP *Three months to the day after terrorists crashed jets into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, President Bush speaks to the Corps of Cadets at the historic military college The Citadel on Tuesday in Charleston, S.C. Bush is outlining some of his plans for the role of the American military in 21st century wars and what it means to fight terrorism.\n\nLoad-Date: December 12, 2001"
