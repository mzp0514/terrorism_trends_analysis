    "full text": "WASHINGTON - Speaking at a conference of relief workers, Franklin Graham said the AIDS epidemic \"is an even bigger threat to civilization as we know it\" than terrorism.\nGraham, the son of evangelist Billy Graham, spoke last Sunday at a conference which drew more than 800 Christian workers from around the world who specialize in helping HIV-positive people and AIDS patients.\nThe event was sponsored by Graham's Samaritan's Purse relief ministry.\nThe AIDS epidemic is a \"plague of biblical proportions,\" Graham said. It needs \"the same level of commitment, zeal, money and resources that we have rightly applied toward combating international terrorism.\"\nChurches should put the problem \"at the top of our agendas\" rather than simply waiting for government to solve it, he said.\nGraham admitted that, like most Christians, he didn't do enough early in the crisis. He also said believers should help remove the disease's social stigma.\n\"Regardless of how it is contracted, we should demonstrate the same love, compassion and care that Jesus Christ would if he were physically walking among us today,\" Graham said.\nBut he said Christian compassion also requires \"telling the truth\" about the disease \"to give people a fighting chance,\" including educating people about the medical risks of sex outside marriage.\n\nLoad-Date: February 25, 2002"
