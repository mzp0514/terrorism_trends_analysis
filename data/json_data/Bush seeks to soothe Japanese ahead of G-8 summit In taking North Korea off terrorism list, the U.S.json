Bush at a summit meeting of top industrialized nations, but first he set out to soothe emotions on a sensitive Japanese issue that's entangled in the nuclear standoff with North Korea.\nBush touched down in Japan on Sunday, his 62nd birthday, and flew aboard the Marine One presidential helicopter to the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido for his eighth and final Group of Eight summit meeting. His first meeting was with Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda.\nThe Japanese government is a key player in the six-party negotiations that led to North Korea's recent declaration about its nuclear activities. Still, Japanese citizens are upset about the U.S. move to remove Pyongyang from the State Department's terrorism blacklist in exchange for North Korea's decision to admit to some of its weapons work.\nJapan has long pushed for the resolution of North Korea's kidnappings of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and '80s as a condition for sending aid and improving relations with the impoverished, reclusive communist nation. The abductees apparently were used to train North Korean agents in Japanese language and customs.\nKnowing that the U.S. action would put a wrinkle in U.S.-Japanese relations, Bush called Fukuda just before the U.S., on June 26, announced its plan to ease sanctions against North Korea and take the country he once labeled as part of his \"axis of evil\" off the terrorism list. Bush told Fukuda the U.S. would continue to push North Korea to resolve the kidnapping issue.\nBefore leaders began arriving for the summit meeting, more than 1,000 people marched Saturday in northern Japan to protest the event. Police arrested four protesters after a brief scuffle. Demonstrators at a park in central Sapporo demanded that the summit nations take urgent measures to stop global warming, grant indigenous people greater rights, combat world poverty and battle discrimination.\n\nNotes\n\n Nation \n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO\n PHOTO - U.S. President George W.
