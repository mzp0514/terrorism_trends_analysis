    "full text": "Attorney General John Ashcroft says he makes \"no apologies\" for using every weapon in his legal arsenal to root out terrorists, and the message has proven popular with many Americans. \n     The loudest objections to Mr. \nAshcroft's aggressive tactics have come from Arab-Americans and civil liberties groups. But now, with some in his own camp raising concerns about whether authorities have pushed too hard, law enforcement officials themselves acknowledge the need for a mid-course correction. \n The trigger for their introspection was a blistering report released earlier this month by Mr. Ashcroft's inspector general at the Justice Department, Glenn A. Fine. It found that few of the 762 illegal immigrants arrested in the government's investigation of Sept. 11 had clear terrorist ties.\nF.B.I. officials, among the main targets of the report, say they don't regret casting a wide net. \"No one wanted to be the person who cut someone loose and then had that decision prove to be fatal,\" a senior F.B.I. official said. Still, officials say they plan to adopt many of Mr. Fine's recommendations. That, they say, will mean establishing clear criteria to identify a terrorism suspect, returning power to immigration officials for removing suspects, and ensuring adequate treatment of prisoners, among other measures.\nBut some aren't sure the changes would do enough to prevent profiling of illegal immigrants as terrorists. \"You can't have a fair system for mass round-ups of people that throw away basic checks and balances,\" said Timothy Edgar legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union.
