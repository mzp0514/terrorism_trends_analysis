    "full text": "For many American officials,\nthere is some merit implicit in\nbeing the object of a personal attack by officials or organs of the Soviet Union. Probably the most desirable notoriety comes with denunciation by a Soviet leader in a public speech.\nComment on recent Tass statement charging Sen Arlen Specter's stand on efforts to prosecute suspected terrorists promotes terrorism (S)Next might come an attack in a front-page editorial in Pravda, the Communist Party paper.\nBut it is certainly no small mention to be zapped by Tass, the official press agency. Many members of Congress have been ignored by Tass for their entire career. So when Arlen Specter, a freshman Republican Senator from Pennsylvania, was criticized by Tass in a recent dispatch, his office was quick to note it was the first time Mr. Specter had drawn Soviet fire.\nThe Tass article, distributed in English with a Washington dateline, said the United States was promoting terrorism. ''And only a few days ago,'' it said, ''Senator Arlen Specter, a fervent supporter of the Washington administration, often reflecting its views, called for considerng the issue of abducting 'anti-American terrorists' and bringng them to the U.S.A.'' This was a reference, Mr. Specter's office said, to legislation proposed by the Senator under which suspected terrorists could be brought forcibly to the United States and prosecuted for violent crimes against any Government employee or agent."
