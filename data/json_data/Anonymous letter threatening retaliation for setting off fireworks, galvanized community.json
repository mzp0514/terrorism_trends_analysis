The writer said the retaliation would be in the coming days and months, according to WXYZ.\n Police checked on the neighbors throughout the evening to make sure there were no incidents, according to WXYZ.\n \"Thank you for writing it because you have brought the community together in a way that I had no ... I don't think anyone had any idea it would bring together this many people,\" Ivanaj told WXYZ. \"It's awesome to see the community come together over... something that they all agreed was just unfair – that letter. It's just ridiculous.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \nCaption Fourth of July fireworks. File photo. (Photo by Yana Paskova/Getty Images) Photo: Yana Paskova/Getty Images\n\nLoad-Date: July 7, 2018"
