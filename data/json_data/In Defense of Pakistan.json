    "full text": "To the Editor:\nYour Sept. 24 editorial ''The Latest Ugly Truth About Pakistan'' is disappointing, to say the least. You accepted as ''hard truth'' the unsubstantiated claim by Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, about Pakistan's collusion with Afghan militants.\nTo this day, no evidence of the Pakistani intelligence agency's support to the militants of the Haqqani network or any other group has been provided to the government of Pakistan, and the agency has categorically denied having any links to them. If there is any evidence, the best course would have been to discuss it with Pakistan, an ally in the war on terrorism. Pakistan's policy has always been to seek a more intensive engagement with the United States.\nThe question is whether Admiral Mullen, the retiring top military officer, is trying to make Pakistan a scapegoat for the troubled war in Afghanistan. We hope not.\nAnd we regret that you cast Pakistan's role in the fight against terrorism and extremism in a negative light. As a result of Pakistan's efforts to root out terrorism, the country has lost more than 30,000 civilian men, women and children and more than 5,000 armed forces personnel, and has suffered billions of dollars in economic losses. Pakistan has thus paid a heavy price for being a front-line state against terrorism.\nMIAN JEHANGIR IQBAL Press Counselor Pakistan Mission to the United Nations New York, Sept. 25, 2011\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: September 27, 2011"
