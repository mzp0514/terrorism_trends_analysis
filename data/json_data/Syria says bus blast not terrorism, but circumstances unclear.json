It was initially suspected to be a terrorist attack because of heavy damage to the bus.\nBut Syria's interior minister said the explosion was caused by excessive pressure in one of the bus's tires, saying \"It is not a terrorist act at all,\" reports Agence France-Presse. He said the blast occurred while the bus was being repaired and killed two workers and the driver, reports the news agency.\nThe bus was extensively damaged, and many local media outlets intially reported it was due to a bomb and had caused dozens of casualties, reports AFP.\nA chunk of the bus nearly the height of a man and somewhat longer was missing, and what was left just below the shattered windows was badly mangled.\nExposed parts of the chassis also appeared to be charred by fire.\nThe engine compartment at the rear of the bus was severely damaged.\nThe Los Angeles Times published a photo of the heavily damaged bus here, saying observers were puzzled by the explosion and that regional media initially reported it as targeting and killing Iranians.\nThe Guardian reports that the casualty figures varied, with Iranian state television reporting that six people had been killed. There was no way to independently verify the government's reported figures, as police sealed off the area of the blast.\nFueling speculation, the blast also coincided with a visit to Damascus by Iran's nuclear negotiator and secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, Saeed Jalili.\nThe Associated Press reports that terror attacks are uncommon in Syria.\nBomb attacks are rare in Syria, where the regime tightly controls the country and cracks down on any form of dissent.\nIn September 2008, a suicide bomber detonated his car near a Syrian security complex on the southern outskirts of the capital, killing 17 people. It was the biggest and deadliest attack in the country since the 1980s when the government fought an uprising by Muslim militants.\nThe Bashar Al-Assad regime has fiercely suppressed Sunni extremism inside Syria, most notably in the brutal crackdown on the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood in Hama in 1982, which killed thousands. The regime also has an interest in downplaying any sectarian attacks, as it comes from the minority Shiite Alawi sect in a majority-Sunni nation.\n(c) Copyright 2009.
