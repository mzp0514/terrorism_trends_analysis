    "full text": "WASHINGTON (AP) - In explaining the U.S. missile strikes in\nAfghanistan and Sudan, Clinton administration officials were careful\nto caution against thinking this was the final salvo in the war\nagainst global terrorism.\nIf, as Joint Chiefs Chairman Hugh Shelton said, this is a new kind of\nwarfare, can the U.S. military win? Can it stop terrorists from\nhitting Americans at home?\nIf U.S. forces are prepared, as Undersecretary of State Thomas\nPickering said Friday, to use any means at their disposal in this\nintensified war against terrorism, what means - chemical, biological\nor other - might the terrorist groups be ready to use? use? use?\nSuch questions cannot be answered with certainty. But what does seem\nlikely is that the war on terror will take a further toll on Americans\nsomewhere.\n\"We should expect future attacks against Americans, whether at home or\nabroad,\" Robert Gates, a former CIA director, said Friday. \"This is a\nprotracted conflict.\"\nPresident Clinton said when he announced Thursday's missile attacks\nthat Americans must realize \"this will be a long, ongoing struggle\nbetween freedom and fanaticism.\"\nThe United States and its interests abroad have been a target of\nterrorists for years. What has changed now is the nature of the\nterrorist threat. Instead of relying on individual states such as Iran\nor Syria for financial support, terrorists now use \"transnational\"\nnetworks not tied to any specific nation, either for resources or for\nideology.\n\"You're talking about a privatization of international terrorism,\"\nsaid Vincent Cannistraro, a former National Security Council\nintelligence director and terrorism expert.\nAs the nature of terrorism has changed, the U.S. national security\nestablishment has been slow to adapt. With the Cold War over, ending\nthe threat of a huge land war in Europe, U.S. military forces have\nbeen reshaped. But the closer coordination needed between the\nmilitary, intelligence and law enforcement agencies to pre-empt and\ndefeat terrorism has sometimes been lacking, experts generally agree.\nRoy Godson, a terrorism expert and president of the National Strategy\nInformation Center in Washington, applauds Clinton's decision to use\nforce. But he urges a broader approach. Moderate Muslim leaders, for\nexample, should be given more help - financial and otherwise - in\ntheir political struggles against the radicals, he said.\nOsama bin Laden, the Saudi exile and Islamic militant whose terrorist\nnetwork was the target of the U.S. missile strikes against his\ntraining camps in Afghanistan and a chemical plant in Sudan, has\ndeclared his intention to carry out a terrorist war against America.\nIn his speech to the nation on Thursday, Clinton said bin Laden had\nvowed to kill Americans and did not care if they were civilians or\nsoldiers. The president said U.S. intelligence had determined that one\nof bin Laden's groups was behind the Aug. 7 embassy bombings in Kenya\nand Tanzania that killed 263 people, including 12 Americans.\nThe embassy bombings, Clinton said, were not the beginning of this\nterrorism war, and the retaliatory U.S. strikes on Thursday were not\nthe end. \"No matter how long it may take,\" he said, the United States\nmust be willing to fight back at every turn. Implicit in his message\nwas a warning that Americans are particularly vulnerable.  vulnerable.  vulnerable.\n\nLoad-Date: August 22, 1998"
