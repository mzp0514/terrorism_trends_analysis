    "full text": "TO THE EDITORS:\nI was more than surprised to read in the Nov. 3 edition of the Intell/New Era that plans for the expansion of the Millersville International House are stalled, partially because of sentiments of one individual who thinks the proposal could lead to terrorism. Terrorism?\nI can think of no better way to combat terrorism than by supporting the efforts of such organizations as Millersville International House that create an environment for listening and mutual respect between cultures. Let's make sure we don't throw the baby out with the bath water. I feel safer going to bed at night knowing that M.I.H. is using good judgment to provide a positive American experience to foreign students on our soil.\nAfter all, some of the most hostile world leaders toward Americans are folks who studied here as international students and, by their own testimony, were not welcomed by us - individuals who were not received with friendship and hospitality or invited into our homes. They now have become bitter and dangerous enemies of ours.\nI hope Millersville Borough Council will use its wisdom to help promote the sustainability of the Millersville International House and in so doing, the safety of our community.\nApril Horst\nLancaster\n\nLoad-Date: November 13, 2009"
