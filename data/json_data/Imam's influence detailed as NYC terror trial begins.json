This is expression, not crimes.\" \nThe arguments are similar to those of the defense in the trial of Sulaiman abu Ghaith, a former al-Qaida spokesman who stood trial in the same courthouse earlier this year on charges of conspiring to kill Americans and other terrorism charges. \nAbu Ghaith's lawyer argued that his client's speeches were controversial and sometimes \"dumb\" but did not prove he knew of any terrorist plots. A jury convicted Abu Ghaith. \nUnlike Abu Ghaith, whose case evolved from the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Masri is charged with actions that occurred in the late 1990s. \nDratel reminded jurors of this and warned them to not be swayed by the city's elevated anxiety about terrorism since September 2001. He said that with the passage of time, opinions of what constituted radical or terrorist behavior changed. \n\"For decades, Nelson Mandela was considered a terrorist,\" Dratel said of the late South African president. \"Now, he's an icon.\" \nIn his opening statement, assistant U.S. Attorney Edward Kim said Masri used his power and influence to dispatch men on deadly missions and gave them money and equipment to carry out those jobs. \n\"His cause was war, and it was all-consuming,\" Kim said. \"His goal was clear, it was simple, and it was vicious.\" \nThe prosecution's first witness was Angelica Morris, who was living in a trailer on the Bly ranch with her husband, daughter, son and younger brother in December 1999, when two mysterious men speaking with British accents arrived one night. \nOne day, Morris said the man, known as Abu Abdullah, took her and her brother, who was 18, outside to demonstrate throat-cutting techniques. \n\"He asked my brother if he would kill a kaffir,\" Morris said, defining \"kaffir\" as a Muslim term for someone who rejects Islam. \"I've killed sheep, so I don't know why I couldn't,\" Morris recalled her brother replying. \nAt that point, Morris said, Abu Abdullah had her brother kneel in front of him and made a slicing motion across her brother's neck without cutting the skin. \nMorris, who has left Islam and lives in Louisiana, described phone calls between Abu Abdullah and Masri. She said Abu Abdullah appeared frustrated that there were not more guns or \"brothers\" on the ranch and felt it was not a suitable training situation. \n\nLoad-Date: April 20, 2014"
