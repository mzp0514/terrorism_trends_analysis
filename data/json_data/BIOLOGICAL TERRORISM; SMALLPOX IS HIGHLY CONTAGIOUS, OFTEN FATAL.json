    "full text": "Smallpox is a viral disease that produces a highly contagious and often fatal infection.\nIt only affects humans, infecting them through broken skin and then spreading to the internal organs.\nThe first symptoms include high fever and weakness - much like influenza followed by a rash on the hands, face and feet.\nThe rash develops into characteristic pus-filled blisters that eventually crust over.\nComplications include blindness, pneumonia and kidney damage. Death usually results if the virus reaches the brain, heart or lungs.\nNo effective treatment exists for the disease, which kills up to 40 percent of its victims.\nSmallpox first appeared in China and the Far East at least 2,000 years ago. The disease reached Europe in A.D. 710.\nIt was brought to America by Hernando Cortez in 1520, and smallpox killed 3.5 million Aztecs in the next two years.\nSmallpox reached plague proportions in the cities of 18th-century Europe.\nIn the 19th century, British scientist Edward Jenner found that material from the pustules of cowpox, a related disease, could be used to make people immune to smallpox itself.\nIn 1967 the World Health Organization launched a campaign to eradicate smallpox using vaccination, surveillance and containment.\nThe last naturally occurring outbreak was in Somalia in 1977.\nBy 1979, the WHO had controlled the last few cases and declared it eradicated.\nNow the only stocks of smallpox virus are kept in vaults in Atlanta and Moscow.\nThese were retained in case the disease ever appears again and further research needs to be done.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPHOTO\n\nLoad-Date: April 2, 1999"
