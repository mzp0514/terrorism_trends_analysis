It warned of a potential crippling of U.S. foreign policy capability unless security and other problems are addressed directly.\nHighlighting what it called \"obsolete information technology\" at U.S. installations, the panel said employees in many posts cannot communicate via e-mail to colleagues in the same building.\nIt also called attention to the decrepit facilities at some posts, including the \"folding-chair embassy\" in Ukraine, so named because staff members must fold chairs in order to get into their work spaces.\nThe report was prepared by the Overseas Presence Advisory Panel, a 26-member grouping established by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright following the bombings at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998.\nPanel chairman Lewis Kaden, of the New York law firm of Davis Polk & Wardell, told reporters that $ 500 million to $600 million will be needed annually over the next decade beyond what the administration would otherwise request to correct deficiencies at the nearly 200 U.S. overseas posts.\nBut, he said, reform measures the panel recommends will lead to significant costs savings, meaning little or no additional outlays to overcome what the report calls \"unacceptable\" conditions at present.\n\nLoad-Date: November 9, 1999"
