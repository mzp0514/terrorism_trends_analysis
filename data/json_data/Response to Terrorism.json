    "full text": "Over the past two weeks, about 100 people, most of them Palestinians, have been killed during fighting in and around Israel. Now, the terrorist bombing of a U.S. warship in a Middle Eastern port has brought that violence home to families in the United States.\nThe United States must spare no reasonable effort to discover and hold accountable those responsible for the attack on the USS Cole and the deaths and injuries of American sailors. But the United States also must not allow a thirst for revenge to influence its policy in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nOne likely goal of a terrorist attack against the United States is to provoke a U.S. military reprisal against an Arab or Palestinian target. Militant groups that oppose any peaceful settlement between the Palestinians and Israel would like nothing more than to incite a U.S. attack that would push popular sentiment in the Islamic world toward war with Israel. The Palestinians are so overmatched by the military power of Israel that their only hope for an armed victory is to draw neighboring Arab nations into the conflict.\nThe likely outcome of such warfare would be another Israeli victory. The leaders of Egypt and Jordan understand that, besides which they have made peace with Israel. The leaders of other neighboring states know the military score as well. (Saddam Hussein is a special case.) But they all must pay attention to the opinions of their people, their understandable sympathy for the Palestinian cause and their frustration and outrage at the continuing rise in the number of Palestinian deaths at Israeli hands during the latest round of violence.\nShort of sparking a pan-Arab attack on Israel, there are more modest goals of Islamic terrorists that a U.S. reprisal would serve. It would pour more gasoline on the flames of violence, and drive another nail into the coffin of the peace process.\nThe United States cannot allow its armed forces to be attacked with impunity. At this writing, there has been no official word about who the perpetrators might be. But when the guilty are discovered, and the United States plans its response, the president, whoever that might be, must be careful not to compromise this nation's hard-won standing as an honest broker for peace. Now that American servicepeople are again part of the death toll in the Middle East, the United States must be wary of being sucked into the vortex of violence and revenge.\n\nLoad-Date: October 15, 2000"
