The emergency laws allow the regime to break up public demonstrations, conduct searches without approval, detain suspects indefinitely, arrest them without trial, and try civilians in a military court.\nThe Egyptian government says that the emergency law is crucial in its fight against terrorism and drug-trafficking, but it has often been used against journalists, activists, and political opponents. In Feb. 2010, Mubarak pledged to replace it with a more narrow anti-terrorism law. But several months later he instead eased the emergency law and said it applies only in the case of terrorism and drug cases - a move that did little to quiet criticism.\n#4 Restrictions on political parties\nMany of the restrictions on political parties in Egypt are laid out in legislation, not the Constitution. But the grounds for banning the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's largest and best organized opposition group, are found in a constitutional ban on parties based on religion. There is also potential for some of the legislative obstacles facing political parties to be eliminated through constitutional changes.\n#3 Presidential candidacy\nThe right to run for president is severely limited. A candidate must belong to a legal party that won at least 3 percent of parliamentary seats in the previous election - a hurdle that few political parties other than Mubarak's National Democratic Party (NDP) can clear. The Muslim Brotherhood - Egypt's most organized opposition group - is banned and therefore its candidates have to run in elections as independents, making them ineligible for the presidency.\nThere are some ways around that requirement. According to Reuters, if an independent candidate can get endorsement from 250 elected officials, he or she can stand in a presidential election. But that's a hard standard to meet in Egypt.\n#2 Elections\nThe opposition is calling for the reinstatement of judicial supervision of elections, a constitutional provision that was eliminated in 2007. Without such monitoring, elections such as the Nov. 2010 parliamentary vote have been badly marred by claims of fraud.\nThe Constitution only allows the Parliament, which has an overwhelming NDP majority, to rule on the eligibility of its members for office. The NDP, which won 97 percent of the vote in November's election, has used this power to invalidate election results in the past.\n#1 Presidential term limits\nAnother demand of the protesters is a constitutional limit on how many terms a president can serve. Presently, there is no limit on the number of six-year terms a president can serve. (Mubarak is now finishing up his fifth term). Protesters want a two-term limit, similar to many other democratic countries.\nEditor's note: Monitor staff photographer Ann Hermes shot video of a large protest in Cairo's Tahrir Square on Tuesday, Feb. 8.\n       \n\nLoad-Date: February 10, 2011"
