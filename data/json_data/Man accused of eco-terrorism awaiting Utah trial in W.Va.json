    "full text": "SALT LAKE CITY - An 18-year-old Provo man has been allowed to leave the state until his trial on accusations that he set a fire at Brigham Young University on behalf of an ecoterrorist group.\nHarrison David Burrows is now living with his father in West Virginia after the U.S. Attorney's Office decided not to appeal a magistrate's order allowing his release until the Sept. 27 trial, spokeswoman Melodie Rydalch said.\nBurrows faces a charge of destruction of property by fire for the July 8 blaze at a farm on the school's campus in Provo. Damage was estimated at about $ 30,000. He faces five to 20 years in prison if convicted.\nThe government last week dropped a count of use of a destructive device against Burrows. That charge carried a 30-year sentence.\nTerms of Burrows' release included being under house arrest unless he's at work. He also cannot use a computer, and he must not have any contact with the Animal Liberation Front or any of its members.\nBurrows allegedly confessed that he set fire to a considerable amount of cardboard at BYU'S Ellwsorth Farm on July 8, according to an FBI affidavit.\nBurrows stated that he and an accomplice set fire to two garden tractors, and both spray-painted pro-Animal Liberation Front graffiti.\nThe farm houses animals used for feed experiments, and the school said animals there are not harmed.\nBurrows also took responsibility for other vandalism at BYU, which included freeing caged rabbits and birds from an on-campus farm. He has not been charged in those incidents.\n-30-\n\nLoad-Date: August 5, 2004"
