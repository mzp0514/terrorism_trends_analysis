    "full text": "It doesn't get much easier than this: Forty years after 11 Israeli Olympic team members were murdered by terrorists at the Munich Olympics, the world's foremost expression of athletic camaraderie and competition should, of course, honor the victims.\nA single, simple moment of silence at the London Olympics to pay tribute to the memories of those savagely killed in Munich - one minute set aside in Games that will last 24,480 minutes - is just moral common sense.\nYet the International Olympic Committee has adamantly refused to express such decency.\nIOC President Jacques Rogge says his organization has remembered the fallen in other ways, including with a moment of silence Monday at the Olympic Village; he says, \"the opening ceremony is an atmosphere that is not fit to remember such a tragic incident.\"\nQuite the contrary. There would be no better place to remember an act of terrorism that was both an attack on a single country, the Jewish state, by the Black September Palestinian group and an assault on all that the Olympic Games is supposed to represent.\nKudos to Bob Costas, the face of the Games on NBC. He calls the committee's decision \"baffling\" and says he'll lead a tribute himself:\n\"I intend to note that the IOC denied the request. Many people find that denial more than puzzling, but insensitive. Here's a minute of silence right now.\"\nGood. Remember their names: David Mark Berger. Ze'ev Friedman. Yossef Gutfreund. Eliezer Halfin. Yossef Romano. Amitzur Shapira. Kehat Shorr. Mark Slavin. Andre Spitzer. Yakov Springer. Moshe Weinberg.\nIf the Olympics insists on trying to erase from memory what happened to them, people have a duty to do better.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nNLVL\n\nLoad-Date: July 25, 2012"
