    "full text": "All the best-laid plans of Big Oil and Big Business (with U.S. government backing) are coming home to roost. Many of the Mideast countries' dictators are being overthrown. Many of these countries were militarized with our tax money, so the governments are killing their own people with weapons supplied by you and me. Whenever anyone broaches this subject, we are usually told it is a very complicated situation. It is actually quite simple. Our congressional representatives and senators are greatly \"influenced\" by Big Oil and Big Business money. In the 1970s, we had high oil prices, long lines waiting to fill your car with gas. In 40 years, Congress has done little to change our energy policy. Why? Now our young people in the military are in harm's way so the oil can continue to flow. So now our young heroes will die with weapons purchased by you and me. Are we feeling good yet about our longstanding energy policy? I feel ill. Some say this is necessary because of terrorism. Yet they don't tell you how much terrorism is created by our need for oil. When will the middle class in this country say enough is enough? We spend over $15 billion per week for our military, yet the Republicans in Congress want to cut money for poor mothers and babies. Where are our priorities?\n\nLoad-Date: April 6, 2011"
