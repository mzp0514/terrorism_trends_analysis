So this theme is very common to fans because it contains the same drama as always.\nOn the other hand Bard of Blood, no doubt satisfy you as a viewer but not as a CONTENT, which we called Netflix originals because, after series like Sacred Games, Ghoul, Leila, our expectations from Netflix live on the sky. Still, Netflix, this time, creates the same Bollywood drama.\nBard Of Blood: Story\nThe plot is simple Kabir Singh ( Emraan Hashmi) is on a mission to rescue his Indian agents with solving various mysteries in Balochistan and Pakistan. Fighting like a champ and always try to win terrorism.\nTable of Contents\nBard Of Blood: Acting\nBard Of Blood: Screenplay and Dialogues\nBard of Blood Season 2: Cast\nBard of Blood Season 2: Release Date\nBard Of Blood: Acting\nThe Serial Kisser Boy (Emraan Hashmi) is best as always, perfect dialogue delivery, great action scenes, living the character entirely. Jaideep Ahlawat, as veer, will convince you that he is the best spy, but trust issues arise on Shobita Dhulipala as her acting doesn't stand that strong.\nRelated Posts\n'The Boys in the Band' First Look: The Groundbreaking Gay...\nDec 30, 2020\n'The Mandalorian' Reveals New Spinoff Series in Finale...\nDec 26, 2020\nBard Of Blood: Screenplay and Dialogues\nThe screenplay is brilliantly written and will make you understand what is happening in the series and help you grip with the set. Writers tried very much to make screenplay enjoyable, and yes, they are succeeding. Dialogues are not that creative, but yes, you will feel that Pakistani atmosphere, but I think more work has to be done on dialogues. Because many times the script will make you confuse about some scenes, I think this thing will have to be improving. You will understand in the first ten-twenty minutes that Imran Hashmi is not web series material. His confines as an actor that we overlooked in movies are clear. His character in the series is of someone who is on the path of self-destruction like Amitabh Bachchan in Sharabi, Sanjay Dutt in Sadak, or Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon. He should be restless, angry, and fierce. Instead, here, he is calm like he has made peace with it. Staring to the floor while speaking your lines does not count for acting, and does not prove anything.\nBard of Blood Season 2: Cast\nHD camera catches everything. More you will observe him and other actors, more you will love Manoj Bajpayee. The way Manoj has delivered his performance is simply fantastic. The further cast may include:\nEmraan Hashmi will act as Kabir Anand\nVineet Kumar Singh will act as Veere Singh\nShishir Sharma will act as Arun Joshi\nAmit Bimrot will act as Nihar Gupta\nAjay Mahendru will act as Rehmat Khatib\nSobhita Dhulipala will act as Isha Khanna\nAshish Nijhawan will act as Aftab Khalid.\nKirti Kulhari will act as Jannat Marri\nAbhishekh Khan will act as Nusrat Bashir Marri\nShaman Ahmed will act as Qasim Baluchi\nJaideep Ahlawat will act as Tanveer Shehzad.\nRajit Kapur will act as Sadiq Sheikh\nSohum Shah will act as Vikramjeet and many others.\nBard of Blood Season 2: Release Date\nThe pandemic attack of the Corona Virus postpones the shooting and release date to the next year.\n\nLoad-Date: December 30, 2020"
