The attacks include the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania by the al-Qaida network while its leader, Osama bin Laden, was living in Sudan. In exchange, Trump notified Congress on Friday of his intent to remove Sudan from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism.\nIt was a foreign policy achievement for Trump just 11 days before Election Day. Previously, the Trump administration engineered diplomatic pacts between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain - the first since Jordan recognized Israel in the 1990s and Egypt in the 1970s.\nTrump said at least five other countries want to come into the deal, which is collectively called the Abraham Accords.\nThe new recognitions of Israel unify Arab nations around their common enemy, Iran. They also upend the traditional Arab strategy of refusing to normalize relations with Israel before an independent Palestinian state is created.\nThe Palestinians say the recognitions amount to betrayal.\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned and rejected the agreement, saying a lasting peace in the region depends on ending the Israeli occupation and creating a Palestinian state. The Islamic militant group Hamas, which rules Gaza, also condemned the agreement.\n\nLoad-Date: October 24, 2020"
