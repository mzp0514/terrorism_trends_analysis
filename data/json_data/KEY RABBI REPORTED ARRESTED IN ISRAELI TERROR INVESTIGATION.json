If the authorities wish to keep him in custody beyond that time, they can do so only on a judges' order and it was not clear whether he will be charged.\nIsraeli radio and TV broadcasts report that Rabbi Moshe Levinger, leader of movement to build Jewish settlements on occupied West Bank, was arrested by police investigating Jewish terrorist ring (S)Founder of Gush Emunim\nRabbi Levinger is a founder and the spiritual leader of Gush Emunim, the movement sponsoring the building of Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank of the Jordan River.\nIn 1968, he led a group of squatters who refused to leave the Palestinian city of Hebron until the Government agreed to build a Jewish settlement nearby.\nThe late Prime Minister Golda Meir agreed to Rabbi Levinger's demands and founded Kiryat Arba, now the largest of more than 100 settlements in the territory seized in the 1967 war.\nEarlier today, before the broadcasts reported that the rabbi had been arrested, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told other Gush Emunim leaders that he would work to strengthen the settlements despite the disclosure of the Jewish terrorist underground.\nA statement by Mr. Shamir's office quoted him as saying that terrorism against Palestinians ''can harm the nation and the settlements.'' But it also said the settlement movement should not be tainted ''by those who strayed'' and he promised that ''the settlement enterprise in the land of Israel will continue.''\nThe statement also said that settlement leaders had condemned the terrorists' actions and reaffirmed the authority of the state for providing security for the settlers.\nRabbi Levinger has refused to condemn the terrorist ring and said the Government was to blame for failing to control Palestinian violence against the settlers."
