Also, creating chaos and fear would serve for terrorism.\"\nThe Turkish press office encouraged students to become familiar with other cultures, according to their email.\n\"Students are a future of a nation, and they are the future journalists, diplomats, doctors, engineers, politicians, experts in all fields,\" according to an email sent from the Turkish press office. \"Our message will be, 'Don't let any fear get to you, and travel. Travel the world and explore. That's the best way to get to know a culture, a country, a person and realities.'\"\nAltinok said he recalls when he came to the U.S. in 2006.\n\"I was an 18-year-old student; I worked at national parks and had met with lots of great people from all over the USA and all over the world, and that's made me know different cultures, people and made me who I am,\" Altinok said.\nAmerica and Turkey have been allies since the 1950s and remain fervent allies against terrorism, according to an email sent from the Turkish press office.\n\"We all only have one world, and it belongs to all of us,\" according to an email from the Turkish press office. \"For that reason, we should all, as a humanity, stand shoulder to shoulder and united. This is our civilization.\"\nTurkish people in the U.S. grieve over the loss that happened in San Bernardino, Orlando, Paris, Belgium and other victims of ISIL's heinous crimes, according to an email sent from the Turkish press office.\nBetween June 5, 2015, and Jun 28, 2016, there have been 14 attacks on Turkish soil, according to The New York Times.\nFrom those attacks, 285 people have died, according to The New York Times.\n\"The Islamic State has never claimed responsibility for any attacks in Turkey, but government officials have now linked the group to at least five bombings,\" according to The New York Times.\nFrom July 16, 2015, to June 13, 2016, there have been three attacks on American soil, and of those attacks, 68 people died, according to the Religion of Peace website.\nIstanbul is number four in the world as the most-visited city in the world, with an estimated 12.56 million visitors per year, according to the Annual MasterCard Global Destinations Cities Index released on June 3.\n\nLoad-Date: January 6, 2017"
