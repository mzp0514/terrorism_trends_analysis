    "full text": "It will be interesting to see how American apologists for Saddam Hussein attempt to explain away the latest United Nations report detailing the Iraqi dictator's \"regime of terror.\"\nThe most egregious atrocities in the report to the U.N. Human Rights Commission were 1,500 summary executions of suspected political dissidents last year.\nMost occurred in November and December during a \"prison cleansing campaign\" that began after a prison visit by one of Saddam's sons, Qusai, head of Iraq's security organization.\nThe massacre of suspected political foes is another outrage on a long list that includes Saddam's brutal invasion of Kuwait, his use of chemical weapons, his slaughter of Iraqi Kurds and Shiites, his flouting of U.N. weapons inspections and other documented violations of the cease-fire agreement that left his regime intact after the Gulf War in 1991.\nThe report was compiled by Max van der Stoel, a former Dutch foreign minister who has been documenting human rights violations in Iraq since 1991.\nIts findings are yet another rebuke to Saddam's supporters in the international community - notably in Russia, France and China, but sympathizers in the United States as well - who assert that lifting sanctions would improve the lives of the Iraqi people and prompt Saddam to loosen his dictatorial grip.\n\"Any Iraqi who is even the slightest bit critical of the government is in danger, even of their life,\" van der Stoel told the rights commission. \"(The regime) only feels secure by maintaining its present policy of oppression.\"\nThe report confirms what has been evident for years: The Iraqi people continue to be terrorized by one of world's most ruthless, unrepentant and uncaring tyrants.\n\nLoad-Date: August 14, 1998"
