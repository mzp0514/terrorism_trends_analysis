Such a question would inevitably return to plague the Turks. After all, they face serious challenges to their national integrity from terrorist groups.\n  Perhaps Mr. Erdogan would like to include the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia or the Iraqi Kurdish separatists in talks for comprehensive peace settlements in his region? I am sure he would find such suggestions not only dangerous but also insulting.\n  If the bar to entry in negotiations is set to be as disruptive as possible, to be ready to carry out acts of terrorism and to represent no recognized territorial entity, then the floodgates are opened for any group with a grievance to muscle its way to the negotiating table by violence.\n  It may not be the simplest strategy to bar such groups as a matter of principle, but in the end, only a determination not to reward terrorism will produce lasting results that will lead to peace. \n  Orin Hollander  Jamison, Pa., April 6, 2009\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: April 9, 2009"
