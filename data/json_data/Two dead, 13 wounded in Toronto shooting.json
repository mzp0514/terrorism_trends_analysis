It was not immediately clear whether he killed himself or was killed by police.\n Police Chief Mark Saunders said he would not speculate on a motive but did not rule out terrorism.\nFor  Syrian rescuers,\nan elaborate escape\n BEIRUT  - The call came on Saturday night. In the raging war zone that is southwestern Syria, with enemy forces on the march, the 98 White Helmets volunteers brought their spouses and children. A total of 421 people massed at two collection points where they were to make their crossing to safety.\n By the time they crossed, they were 422. One woman went into labor, requiring an emergency C-section. Her son, Nairouz, came into the world in an open field just short of the frontier with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.\n It was just one moment of drama in a complicated international rescue operation to extract the Syrian volunteer rescuers who work in opposition areas through their country's bitter enemy Israel by bus to a temporary haven in Jordan.\n Another nearly 400 people were meant to be pulled out as well. Most didn't make it in time to the assembly points, unable to go through roads that were closing fast by the advancing Syrian forces on one side and the expanding Islamic State militants on the other.\n From wire reports\n\nLoad-Date: July 24, 2018"
