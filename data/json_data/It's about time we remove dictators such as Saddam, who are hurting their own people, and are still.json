    "full text": "In his letter to the editor last week, Mr. James McGowan, a political science student, brought up the validity of the American, British and Australian invasion of Iraq, as per the united Nations charter. I suggest that a closer look at the document will confirm what we already know; the war is completely legal, and is in the interests of all nations.If we look at Article 1, clause 1, of the charter we see that \"The Purposes of the United Nations are ... the prevention and removal of threats to the peace.\" I believe, and most people do as well, that Saddam Hussein is a direct threat to the peace of the world, and therefore the coalition is legally able to remove him.\nIf we look further, Article 51 states that \"Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations.\" We know that Iraq has not directly attacked the United States, nor has it attacked the UK. However must we always wait until we are attacked, before we decide to take action?\nHad the US known about Pearl Harbour (whether they did or not, let's not open that can of worms), would they have attacked the Japanese Fleet? They obviously had the capability to do so, as they had a significant air force stationed at the port. Of course they would have, since they knew the Japanese had hostile intent, and were committed to their acts of war.\nIn a strikingly similar fashion, the Iraqi regime is dedicated to anti-American, and anti-western policies and practices; they fund Palestinian terrorism, they destabilize the Middle East, they attack their own citizens who practice the same faith, and are a general nuisance to the civilized world.\nIt's about time we remove dictators such as Saddam, who are hurting their own people, and are still a threat to peace. It is sometimes said that it takes money to make money. Well in this case, it might take war, to bring about a lasting peace.\nRobert Phillips\n1st year, Business Admin Co-Op\n\nLoad-Date: July 16, 2020"
