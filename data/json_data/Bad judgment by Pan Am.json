    "full text": "Fears of terrorism related to the war against Iraq understandably have caused tensions to rise over the security of air travel. The response by Pan American World Airways to the concern, however, is offensively inappropriate.\n   Since the start of the war Jan. 16, Pan Am has refused to allow Iraqi citizens or even Iraqi nationals living legally in the United States to board planes. The airline won't discuss its screening process in detail, but obviously the policy must be tricky to enforce except on international flights, where passengers are required to show their passports.\n \n    Without such identification, how does Pan Am know someone is a citizen of Iraq? Are ticket agents trained to question people who fit a certain profile, with a certain style of clothing or certain color ofskin? Or is it just that certain look in their eyes?\n \n    Though the bomb in a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 gives the airline more reason than some in the industry to be painfully aware of the prospect of terrorism, such selective suspicion is out of place in a free world, even a free world at war.  There are other increased security measures that help assure safe travel during these frightening times without infringement upon civil rights.\n \n    An airline employee told the New York Times that Iraqi passengers are being told Pan Am cannot transport them but will help them find reservations on other carriers. Even if that were suitable behavior, it seems to be no guarantee for Iraqi passengers.  Officials at other airlines questioned by the Times would neither confirm nor deny whether they, too, were banning Iraqis.\n \n    The practice should be stopped immediately.\n \n\nLoad-Date: November 12, 1992"
