    "full text": "To the Editor:\nYour Sept. 9 editorial ''A Grim Endgame Looms in Syria'' was right about what's at stake as President Bashar al-Assad's forces launch a bloody offensive on the last rebel stronghold in Syria. A humanitarian disaster looms. A United Nations official is predicting the ''biggest loss of life of the 21st century,'' leaving thousands with nowhere to go. \n  But the editorial overlooked another troubling development: Mr. Assad's allies in the attack are backed by the United States. New reports suggest that the Y.P.G., a terrorist group operating from Syria that has received arms and aid paid for by American taxpayers, has forged an alliance with Mr. Assad and is sending troops as part of a deal brokered in July to help him recapture Idlib from the rebels.\n  The alliance has grown deeper since senior leaders of the so-called Syrian Democratic Forces, spearheaded by the Y.P.G., held formal talks with the Syrian regime to carve out a place for themselves in the new Syria.\n  Y.P.G. is the Syrian affiliate of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (P.K.K.), which has led a violent campaign of terrorism inside Turkey for more than three decades. Turkey, the United States and the European Union have designated the P.K.K. a terrorist organization.\n  Having Y.P.G. forces operating from Syria, just miles from the border of Turkey, is untenable. It's time for Washington to assess who its real allies in the region are.\n  Mevlut Cavusoglu Ankara, TurkeyThe writer is minister of foreign affairs for Turkey.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/13/opinion/letters/turkey-syria.html\n\nLoad-Date: September 14, 2018"
