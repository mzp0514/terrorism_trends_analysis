    "full text": "NEW DELHI Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wrapped up a three-day visit to India Tuesday, downplaying differences over Iran, stressing the shared goal of a stable Afghanistan and calling for greater U.S. company access to India’s booming economy.\nBut Clinton reserved her most pointed comments for neighboring Pakistan, which she called on to stop using its territory as a safe haven for insurgents keen on striking nearby countries or its own people. \n“We look to the government of Pakistan to do more,” she said at a press conference with Indian foreign minister S.M. Krishna. “We need stronger, more concerted efforts against the scourge of terrorism.” \nIndia was the last leg of an Asia trip that included China and Bangladesh. Indian and U.S. officials are set to meet again in Washington in mid-June for strategic talks. \nClinton and Krishna also discussed the ticklish issue of Iran. The U.S. has pushed India to halt Iranian oil imports in order to stem Tehran’s nuclear ambitions, which India has resisted. Clinton said that both nations shared the same goal of a nuclear-weapons-free Iran, vowing to send an envoy to India next week to help search for alternate sources of energy. \nClinton and Krishna also discussed Afghanistan during a one-hour meeting as NATO combat troops prepare to depart by 2014. India has agreed to host a business conference in June aimed at encouraging companies to invest more in Afghanistan.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton asked India to open its economy to U.S.\n\nLoad-Date: November 30, 2023"
