None of them has been charged, however, in what authorities consider the most egregious of animal-rights related incidents targeting University of California scientists during the past year -- two August 2008 firebombings at the homes of UC-Santa Cruz biomedical researchers.\nOne-time Cabrillo College student Nathan Pope, 26, and former UC-Santa Cruz student Adriana Stumpo, 23, were arrested by the FBI at the airport in Charlotte, N.C. upon their return Thursday to the U.S. from Costa Rica, authorities reported. They appeared in federal court in Charlotte on Friday and will face extradition to California.\nThe other two suspects -- Joseph Buddenberg, 25, and former UC-Santa Cruz student Maryam Khajavi, 20 -- were arrested by the FBI and University of California-Berkeley police Friday. Khajavi was arrested in Oakland, Calif., and Buddenberg, the only one of the four not tied to the raided house in Santa Cruz, was arrested at the Alameda County Courthouse.\nSanta Cruz Police Chief Howard Skerry said the arrests came \"due to the tenacity of investigators,\" but declined to provide details about the ongoing probe. Still, he said he was pleased with the progress made in the past year.\n\"A lot of cases are very complex,\" Skerry said. \"We don't give up on the cases. If it takes years, it takes years.\"\nThe scientist whose home was the scene of the attempted home invasion did not return several messages Friday and has been reluctant for the past year to discuss the case. However, Skerry said police detectives notified her family of the arrests.\nSkerry declined to say if there had been any other threats against UC-Santa Cruz researchers since the August firebombings.\n\"We are extremely grateful for the efforts of federal law enforcement officials, the Santa Cruz Police Department, and other organizations that have been involved in this ongoing investigation,\" said Stephen E. Thorsett, the dean of UC-Santa Cruz's Division of Physical and Biological Sciences. \"Our students, staff, and faculty -- who are doing important research into the causes and cures for human diseases such as cancer and Parkinson's -- deserve to work and live in a safe environment, without fear that they and their families will be targets of violent actions and threats.\"\nThe suspects will be charged at least in part under the federal Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act, which carries a penalty of up to five years for each violation in which victims claim they feel their life has been threatened by activity meant to interfere with animal research. It wasn't immediately clear how many counts the suspects will face when they appear in U.S. District Court later this month.\nThe foursome are accused of being involved in demonstrations in front of homes of UC-Berkeley researchers in October 2007 and January 2008, as well a protest and home invasion attempt at the house of a UC-Santa Cruz researcher in February 2008. In the February attack, which occurred during a child's birthday party, the scientist's husband suffered minor injuries.\nUC-Berkeley scientists who use animals in their research have reported a string of vandalism attacks at their homes since then. University of California-Los Angeles researchers have also been the target of firebombings.\nA criminal complaint filed against the suspects Thursday said three of them -- Pope, Buddenberg and Stumpo -- were first detained outside the home of a UC-Berkeley scientist in October 2007. Authorities said all four suspects participated in a day of demonstrations outside the homes of six other UC-Berkeley researchers in January 2008, and a vehicle linked to the incidents was registered to Khajavi's mother.\nAt the raided home, police also linked Khajavi to the vehicle spotted leaving the scene of the February 2008 attempted home invasion. Police found her and two other suspects at the house later that night, and recovered from her vehicle a bullhorn and bandanas allegedly used in the incident.\nAlso during a search of the property, investigators found the personal information of researchers scribbled on an envelope and piece of paper.\nPope and Buddenberg were also identified from surveillance video taken in July 2008 at a Kinko's, where authorities say a computer was used to download information from UC-Santa Cruz's Web site about 11 biomedical researchers. The pair were also captured on surveillance video at a coffee shop, Caffe Pergolesi, where fliers encouraging violence against the researchers were discovered two days later. The firebombings outside the homes of two of those scientists occurred a week later.\nJoseph M. Schadler, FBI spokesman, declined to say whether the agency believes the four suspects could be responsible for two firebombings -- cases that could result in attempted murder charges. Researcher David Feldheim's leg was injured as he and his family escaped from the second floor of their town home near campus after a firebomb was placed on their front porch. A colleague's car was burned outside a campus residence the same morning.\n\"The investigation is still going on,\" Schadler said. \"There is much more being done. It doesn't just stop with an arrest.\"\nCaffe Pergolesi's owner, Karl Heiman, who first notified authorities of the fliers last year, said, \"I'm glad they got caught. I think that's good news.\nHe said similar fliers have not been seen since on the shop's community bulletin board, saying, \"We've been watching it very closely.\"\nOne of the four arrested this week has been in legal trouble recently. Pope was arrested and charges with perjury when evidence surfaced last summer that he had obtained a state Department of Motor Vehicles identification card in under the name \"Nathan Knoerl\" without indicating he had a prior ID in a different name. In December, he pleaded no contest to the lesser charge of providing false information to the DMV and was sentenced to time served and probation.\nHowever, during those court proceedings investigators never linked Pope to the animal rights protests. Pope and his attorney denied his involvement with the violent demonstrations.\nStumpo attended UC-Santa Cruz as a literature major from September 2004 through March 2008. Khajavi attended UC-Santa Cruz as a community studies major from September 2006 through June 2008. The campus records department was unable to determine whether degrees were conferred to either woman.\n------\nCHARGES\nThe four suspects are accused of the following:\n--Oct. 21, 2007: A group of 20 protesters demonstrated outside of a UC-Berkeley professor's home. Some wore bandanas to hide their faces. They trespassed on his front yard, chanted slogans and accused him of being a murderer because of his use of animals in research.\n--Jan. 27, 2008: Demonstrations, including chalking, in front of the homes of several UC researchers.\n--Feb. 20, 2008: A group of five protesters tried to forcibly enter the Westside home of a UC-Santa Cruz researcher during a child's birthday party. The researcher's husband was hit during the demonstration.\n--July 29, 2008: Fliers left at Caffe Pergolesi in Santa Cruz that contained the names, addresses and telephone numbers of several UC-Santa Cruz scientists. The fliers said the researchers were \"torturers alive and well in Santa Cruz\" and stated, \"We know where you live. We know where you work. We will never back down until you end your abuse.\"\n------\nANIMAL ENTERPRISE TERRORISM ACT\nWhoever uses or causes to be used any facility of interstate commerce for the purpose of damaging or interfering with the operations of an animal enterprise, and in connection with such purpose intentionally places a person in reasonable fear of fear of death or serious bodily injury to that person or an immediate family member, or conspires or attempts to do so, by a course of conduct involving threats, acts of vandalism, property damage, criminal trespass, harassment or intimidation, shall be imprisoned for not more than five years.\n \n\nLoad-Date: February 21, 2009"
