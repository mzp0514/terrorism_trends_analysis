This includes the ridiculous claim that a laborer with information on ''perimeter security'' could easily cause a reactor meltdown.\n  A nuclear power plant's strong physical construction, redundant safety systems and multilayered protective strategies provide both a strong deterrent and a strong defense against potential threats.\n  An array of independent experts, including former military, Federal Bureau of Investigation and security officials, has attested to the formidable security at nuclear energy facilities.\n  They recognize that since 2001 nuclear power plant owners have spent in excess of $2 billion on security enhancements that include a 60 percent increase, to 8,000 total officers, in the size of the industry's armed, paramilitary security forces, and substantial physical improvements to provide additional protection against vehicle bombs and other potential terrorist assaults.\n  The industry recognizes that its energy facilities are important assets to the communities in which they operate and to the nation's energy security. We protect them accordingly.\n  Anthony R. Pietrangelo Senior V.P.  and Chief Nuclear Officer Nuclear Energy Institute Washington, May 6, 2010\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nLoad-Date: May 13, 2010"
