    "full text": "To the Editor:\nBecause it was in The Chronicle Review, the forum on the jihadi movement was a disappointment -- there was no real examination of the issue (\"The Future of the Jihadi Movement: a 5-Year Forecast,\" October 20). Forecasts are not analyses, and extrapolation of current conditions can always be undone by additional conditions that turn up. In this case, conditions that will be created by the target communities or states are an important factor....\nTerrorism in different forms has been around for a long, long time. Like any other action, terrorism does not happen in a vacuum. Current terrorism can be easily traced to the creation of Israel at the urge of a colonial power, Britain. The problem was not the creation of Israel, but the manner in which it was imposed on people whose ancestors had lived in the area for centuries. This was followed by unconditional U.S. support for the actions of the state of Israel. To Arabs and Muslims in general, we became an unjust nation....\nHere is my prescription: Let Congress approve a list of 10 or 12 guiding principles that will be the basis for American foreign policy, applicable to allies and opponents alike. This announced list of principles will promote evenhandedness, restore our role as an honest broker, eliminate the appearance of unconditional support to certain nations, and promote goodwill toward the United States....That just might take the lifeblood out of the jihadi movement, and of terrorism as well.\nA. Duttaahmed\nRamona, Calif.\n\nLoad-Date: November 28, 2006"
