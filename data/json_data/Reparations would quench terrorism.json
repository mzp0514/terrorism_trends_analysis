    "full text": "We can checkmate terrorism, now and in the future, by paying reparations to the Palestinians for territories taken since 1947 by Israel.\nWe tend to forget -- but the Arab world does not -- that this eviction was by Israeli use of force and assault, causing the Arab world to hate Israel ever since.\nIn the intervening years, the United States supported Israel and derivatively has also become the target of terrorism.\nIn 1947, the United Nations should have compensated the Palestinians for being dispossessed, but it did not.\nIn 2001, the United States gave Israel $ 2.82 trillion and has given more than $ 84 billion through 2000.\nFor a small price, the United States can buy immunity from Arab terrorism by giving the Palestinians an annual monetary grant equal to that given to Israel, thus placating Arab hostility and redressing what the Arabs perceive to be one of history's great injustices.\nSuch annual grants to the Palestinians could be monitored so as to be restricted to economic, not military, uses. Then, a prosperous Palestinian state could emerge with mercantile, industrial and export-import capacity and good housing. Such evenhanded generosity would allay the Arabs who perceive a continued wrong. Unless this is done, in my view, terrorism will never end.\nWilliam J. Flynn Jr.\nJudge, New York State\nCourt of Claims, retired\nAmherst, N.Y.\nCorrection\n\nA letter Tuesday by William J. Flynn on paying reparations to the Palestinians should have said that in 2001 the United States gave Israel $2.82 billion.\nCorrection-Date: November 12, 2001, Monday\n\nLoad-Date: November 16, 2001"
