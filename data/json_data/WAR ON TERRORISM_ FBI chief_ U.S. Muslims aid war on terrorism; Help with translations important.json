His presence at the group's annual convention upset some conservatives and Jews, who said that members of the AMC have expressed support for terrorist groups and Islamic charities with alleged terrorist ties.\nDuring the luncheon address, the FBI director was interrupted briefly by two men who stood in front of the podium holding white pieces of paper that read: \"Shame on Mueller\" and \"The FBI Should Protect Americans from Terror.\"\nThe men were escorted out of the room, and Mueller continued his 30-minute speech, delivered in a hotel banquet room just outside Washington.\nFaiz Rehman, spokesman for the American Muslim Council, said that the protesters were from a Jewish group and were allowed to attend the luncheon \"in the spirit of a free America.\"\nMueller spoke of the controversy at the end of his speech.\n\"Unfortunately, persons associated with this organization have in the past made statements that indicate support for terrorism and for terrorist organizations,\" he said.\n\"I think we can --- Muslims and non-Muslims alike --- justifiably be outraged by such statements.\"\nWhile the rounds of applause cooled a bit after that statement, the crowd of about 150 still gave Mueller a warm reception.\nCooperation was key\nThe FBI director told the group that cooperation between law enforcement and Muslim communities throughout the nation has been key to the terrorism investigation since Sept. 11.\nThe FBI instructed its 56 field offices to reach out to Muslim communities, who were suffering a backlash of anger after the acts of terror in New York, Pennsylvania and at the Pentagon.\nSince then, agents have had more than 500 gatherings with Muslim groups and 6,000 contacts with individuals, Mueller said.\n\"They write back with story after story of productive meetings, insights, generosity and subsequent assistance,\" the FBI director said.\nIn addition, he said, Muslims showed an \"extraordinary\" response to a government request last fall for Arabic and Farsi language experts.\n\"Within hours, our switchboard was overwhelmed with calls, and those who came forward included doctors, lawyers, engineers, academics --- Muslim and Arab-Americans from all walks of life who were willing to quit their jobs [and] come and work for the FBI,\" he said.\n\"Already, these language experts have made important contributions.\"\nMueller did not answer specific written questions from the audience.\nHe did comment on the AMC's concerns about new government powers to search people, monitor them or detain them without charges.\nMueller asserted that law enforcement officials do not act without reason and that the broader surveillance powers will not change anything.\nSome groups, including the Center for Security Policy, a conservative think tank, and the American Jewish Committee, have blasted Mueller for appearing before the AMC, whose founder, Abdurahman Alamoudi, expressed support in a 2000 speech for the Hamas and Hezbollah militant groups in the Middle East.\nThe United States has deemed both to be terrorist organizations.\nIn addition, critics note that the AMC supports the Holy Land and Global Relief foundations, even though both are suspected by the United States of raising money for terrorists.\n\nGraphic\n\n \nPhoto: Two men said to be from a Jewish group protest a speech by FBI Director Robert Mueller to the American Muslim Council in Alexandria, Va., Friday.
