    "full text": "A third of last year's $$ @40 billion anti-terrorism package remains unspent, leaving enough money to carry federal agencies through the last seven weeks of the federal budget year, the White House budget office said Friday. \nRather than a routine status report, Democrats said they saw the announcement as a prelude to a decision by President Bush to not spend a portion of a separate $$ @28.9 billion counterterrorism measure that Congress approved last month. \nWhite House officials have said Bush has not decided whether to spend the $$ @5.1 billion portion of the newer bill, which includes money for the Defense Department, state and local law enforcement agencies and the FBI. If he doesn't, it is sure to spark criticism from Democrats and plaudits from conservatives. \nIn a quarterly report, the White House said only $$ @25.8 billion of the $$ @40 billion package had been spent or committed to contracts through June 30. The money was approved days after the Sept. 11 attacks, though details of how it is to be spent were not completed until December. \n\"Historic trends would indicate that current funding levels are sufficient to cover agencies\" until the fiscal year ends Oct. 1, the White House budget office said in a written statement.\n\nLoad-Date: August 15, 2002"
