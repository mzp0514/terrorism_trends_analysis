    "full text": "A man suspected of making three pipe bombs was arrested Thursday in Bucks County. \nJohn Grzyminski, 50, was taken into custody after a Solebury Township police officer spotted his black pickup truck. \nGrzyminski was charged with multiple counts of risking catastrophe and unlawful possession or manufacture of weapons of mass destruction, and other offenses. \nWednesday afternoon, his mother called authorities after finding a pipe bomb in the kitchen of her home in the 1800 block of Saddle Drive in Warrington. \nThe neighborhood was evacuated as local police received help from the Philadelphia police bomb squad and agents of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said Special Agent Steven Bartholomew, an AFT spokesman. \nTwo more 'assembled devices” were found, and all three were remotely defused by the bomb squad, Bartholomew said. \nInvestigators were treating the case as an 'isolated incident ... not terrorism-related,” he said. \nThe mother and son apparently had an ongoing disagreement, but Bartholomew could not confirm a report that she had been trying to evict her son. \nFirearms and other evidence were also removed from the house, Bartholomew said. \nThe remnants of the pipe bombs were shipped to an ATF laboratory in Washington for examination. \nContact staff writer Peter Mucha at 215-854-4342 or pmucha@phillynews.com.    \n\nLoad-Date: May 11, 2012"
