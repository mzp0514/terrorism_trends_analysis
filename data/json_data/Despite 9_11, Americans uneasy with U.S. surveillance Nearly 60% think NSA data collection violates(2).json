A similar majority opposes the legal process supervised by a secret federal court that oversees the government's classified surveillance.\nThe American public is still anxious about terrorism on the 12th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. About 6 in 10 Americans feel it is sometimes necessary to sacrifice rights to confront terrorism.\nBut suspicions about the government's promises to protect civil liberties have deepened since 2011. Only 53 percent now say the government does a good job of ensuring freedoms, compared with 60 percent two years ago.\nThe shift in public attitudes follows a three-month barrage of leaks to media organizations by Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who released secret documents about the surveillance agency's inner workings.\nIn follow-up interviews \nafter the poll, some respondents described Snowden as a criminal and an attention-seeker. Others called him a whistleblower. However, many agree that his disclosures have highlighted the once-remote issue of government surveillance.\nIt's not surprising this was going on, but I think all these revelations brought it home to people, said Sam Thomas, a former musician from Knoxville, Tenn.

About 56 percent oppose the NSA's collection of telephone records for future investigations even though they do not include actual conversations. Some 54 percent oppose the government's collection and retention of Internet metadata for future investigations that avoids actual email contents; only 34 percent favor such efforts.\nEven stronger majorities oppose unauthorized government surveillance of phone calls and Internet mail traffic within the United States.
