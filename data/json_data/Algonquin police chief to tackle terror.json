Laine, 58, Algonquin's chief since 1985, was elected as the organization's fifth vice president in 2003.\nEvery year since then, he has climbed the ranks of the 22,000-member organization.\nHe was sworn in as president in November, and Algonquin officials celebrated this week with a party at village hall.\n\"Russ Laine has really done our community proud,\" Village President John Schmitt said. \"I think it says a lot for his efforts ... and we are very proud.\"\nDuring his year in office, Laine wants to focus on ending gun violence, a point he has frequently brought to Washington lawmakers.\n\"This gun violence thing is one thing that's very timely; it's an important aspect for us to work with,\" he said.\nLaine already has met with staffers from Vice President-elect Joe Biden's team on law enforcement issues and within the next few months will travel to association-sponsored police conferences in Taiwan and Estonia in hopes of attracting new international members.\n\"Personally I'm excited about it. It's challenging, but it's very rewarding,\" he said of the new post.\n\"We believe that, hopefully, Algonquin will be a better place. We can bring some things back here.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \nRuss Laine CHRISTOPHER HANKINS/chankins@dailyherald.com Algonquin Police Chief Russell Laine\n\nLoad-Date: January 9, 2009"
