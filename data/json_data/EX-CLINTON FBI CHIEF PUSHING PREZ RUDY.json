It is meant to highlight Giuliani's efforts at battling crime and cleaning up a once dangerous and tattered environment, a skill he has suggested could be just as useful in Iraq today as New York of the 1990s.\ndsaltonstall@nydailynews.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \nRudy Giuliani enjoys coffee at the Broadway Grill in Burlingame, Calif., yesterday.
