Cartoonist Musa Kart was also arrested, the newspaper confirmed.\nFriday, nine members of Parliament from the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party, known as HDP, were also arrested on terrorism-related charges. The arrests were condemned by the European Union.\nThe crackdown on the Kurdish politicians and the media began after a failed coup attempt in July by a faction of the military. About 35,000 people were arrested and tens of thousands of civil servants were fired. Turkey imposed a state of emergency after the attempted coup, expanding the government's powers, allowing it to rule by decree.\nTurkey has also been throttling internet access, including to social media sites like Twitter and Facebook, while mobile internet access was also restricted at times.Some users have also reported problems accessing virtual private networks, which are used to circumvent bans. Turkey blocks tens of thousands of websites.\nThe arrests of the HDP members of the Grand National Assembly came on top of Ankara removing the elected mayors of more than two dozen Kurdish municipalities - including in the city of Diyarbakir, considered the cultural capital of the Kurds - and replacing them with loyalists.\n\nLoad-Date: November 8, 2016"
