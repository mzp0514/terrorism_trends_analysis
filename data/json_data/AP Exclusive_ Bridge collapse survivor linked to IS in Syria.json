All of the occupants of their bus survived.\nHis injuries included headaches, arm, neck and back pain, nightmares and post-traumatic stress disorder, records show. One letter from a therapist said Roble \"seems the most traumatized of all the siblings\" and \"he worked on his spiritual belief that â€˜God had saved him for a purpose.'\"\nFor his injuries, a 2009 state court order says, Roble was due to receive a lump sum payment of $65,431.22 on his 18th birthday - roughly a month and a half before federal prosecutors say he left the U.S. for Istanbul.\nRoble's name surfaced in federal court last week during the trial of three Minnesota men accused of conspiring to travel to Syria to join the IS group. Testimony has suggested that at least some of the men in the group knew Roble had money and asked him to fund their own trips. One man believed Roble had gone to Syria with thousands of dollars and used it to pay for fighters' weddings and cars.\nThe bridge collapse was not mentioned during the trial. The Associated Press made the connection using state court records to trace the bridge collapse victim to a Minneapolis high school, then matched the victim's yearbook picture to a photo the government has provided of the young man believed to be in Syria. A handful of people who knew the family also confirmed the match.\nAccording to evidence presented in federal court last week, Roble flew to Istanbul in October 2014 as part of an itinerary that included a trip to China. He was due to return to the U.S. in June 2015, but never did, FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force Officer Joel Pajak testified.\n\"We received information that Mr. Roble ended up in Syria with his uncle, Abdi Nur,\" Pajak testified.\nNur is among 10 men charged in the case and is believed to be fighting with the Islamic State group; six others have pleaded guilty, and testimony in the trial of the other three wrapped up on Friday.\nProsecutors say the men were part of a group of friends who recruited and inspired each other to join the Islamic State group. Roble has not been charged, but prosecutors included his picture in a court exhibit that contains the photos of 16 men who authorities say joined or conspired to join militant groups in Syria and Somalia.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n This undated photo provided by the U.S. Attorney's Office shows Mohamed Roble.
